Forty million kids around the world are involved in organized athletics each year PERIOD

About  percent say thats how they met their closest friends PERIOD Childhood obesity is  times less likely PERIOD Standardized test scores can be up to  percent higher PERIOD Adolescents are  percent more likely to go to college PERIOD

Athletics can do that PERIOD

Thirteen different types of cancer are significantly less likely PERIOD Suicidal ideation can decrease by more than  percent PERIOD High risk kids are onethird as likely to be arrested during adolescence and a quarter as likely to become criminal offenders during adulthood PERIOD

Athletics can do that PERIOD

Building tolerance competence and confidence PERIOD Learning skills for teams selfesteem and how to dream PERIOD Developing cooperation innovation and motivation PERIOD Knowing how to act interact and not distract PERIOD

Athletics can do that PERIOD

A . million coverup for  reports of assault PERIOD Thirty years with a predator in a position of power PERIOD Thirty years of a predator earning six figures annually to tear away the integrity of the sport PERIOD Thirty years of an organization designed to protect its athletes covering up the worst sex scandal in history PERIOD

Athletics did that PERIOD

But that is not what athletics are supposed to be about PERIOD The value that people gain from being physically active from childhood all the way through adulthood is undeniable PERIOD But organizations like USA Gymnastics and abusers like Larry Nassar have exploited the importance of athletics PERIOD The sanctity of athletics is under attack and we need to take it back PERIOD

MSUs mishandling of Nassar sexual assault shows institutional complacency disregard for victimsAly Raisman Jordyn Wieber Simone Biles PERIOD The list of household names of beloved Team USA gymnasts now is not only Read

USA Gymnastics needs to be scrapped so that an organization that values its athletes can rise from the ashes PERIOD People who take advantage of young athletes need to be cast aside so that those wanting to inspire teach and support young athletes can emerge from the shadows PERIOD

It should not take  tragedies to create a safe athletic environment  it shouldnt even take one PERIOD We cannot feed this culture any longer PERIOD We need to recognize the gravity of the problem and commit to doing better PERIOD Protecting athletes needs to be the top priority of every sports governance body because without the athletes there would be no athletics PERIOD

The purpose of athletics has been lost and it is important that we remember what the goal is PERIOD We must not allow fame money power or adoration to cloud the importance of physical activity extracurricular involvement social engagement and most importantly safety PERIOD

Athletes around the world from all different sports should feel an obligation to step forward and stand up for something that so many of us have always held close to our identities PERIOD Sports shine a light on the darkest days PERIOD Sports are a source of strength when you feel most weak PERIOD Sports provide energy when you are most weary PERIOD They help you find wisdom when you are lost and camaraderie when you feel most alone  at least thats what sports are supposed to be PERIOD

Sports section says Should an athletes behavior off the field affect how we talk about them on the fieldIn the modern era of sports we know a lot more about athletes than just their stats PERIOD Through social media Read

We need to do a better job of protecting young athletesbecause mental toughness should come from overcoming a hard practice not overcoming assault PERIOD

Because athletics are supposed to be about athletes not administrators PERIOD

Because practice should be an escape from the world not somewhere you want to escape from PERIOD

Because coaches trainers and athletic administrators are supposed to build athletes up not tear them down PERIOD

Because athletics should teach us to be fearless not to be afraid PERIOD

Because athletics are too important too sacred and too valuable to be destroyed by a few people who disrespect the sanctity of sport PERIOD

Because the hardest part about practice shouldnt be anything more than the workout itself PERIOD
