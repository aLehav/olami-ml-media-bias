The Barge has quite possibly never been so over capacity as it was Saturday night when students and parents alike filled the Hamilton coffee house to hear junior Collin McLoughlins latenight concert PERIOD As last years Mr PERIOD Colgate McLoughlin held the gig as a part of the Barges Saturday Nite Music Series and seemed surprised by the astounding turnout claiming it was definitely one of the largest crowds hed played for at Colgate PERIOD Despite the masses he was aiming to please McLoughlin managed to play a string of covers and original works that did not fail to leave the crowd wanting more over the course of his hourlong performance PERIOD From start to finish McLoughlin proved that he is above all else an extremely talented musician PERIOD

McLoughlins music is acoustic mostly indie in genre featuring both guitar and vocals PERIOD His set included several covers of familiar favorites as well as his own original songs some old some making their first public debuts PERIOD He started out the night with songs like Free Falling originally sung by Tom Petty though McLoughlin chose to play John Mayers rendition and from there onto originals Burn Away and one of the first songs he ever wrote You Had Your Shot. the set continued on with McLoughlins friends and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity brothers shouting out favorite requests keeping the atmosphere in the Barge light and fun as McLoughlin moved from one song to the next PERIOD The Beatles Black Bird was followed by a new song Hold On which only a few people had heard before Saturday night PERIOD Despite the popular requests that he play Stronger a new take on Kanye Wests song which was a part of the medley that helped McLoughlin to win Mr PERIOD Colgate  McLoughlin chose not to replay the song PERIOD Instead he decided to debut a new mix one that showed some rather new sides to songs like City of Angels by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Lollipop by Lil Wayne PERIOD It certainly says something about his musical talents that he could take such songs and make them seem as if they were made as a mellow song for the acoustic guitar PERIOD

The night continued on with a few more coversTwo Coins by Dispatch and one of McLoughlins favorites Slow Dancing in a Burning Room by John Mayeras well as several more original works like This Dream and the requested Tangible Memories. even as McLoughlin seemed to reach his final song chants and demands for one more brought him back on stage to play Paolo Nutinis New Shoes. he was great junior Shelby Scott said of McLoughlins performance PERIOD This was a big crowd and he didnt disappoint. fellow students werent the only ones impressed by McLoughlin PERIOD Visiting parents of one of McLoughlins fraternity brothers the Crowes were equally awed PERIOD

I think hes as good as John Mayer Mr PERIOD Crowe said comparing him to one of McLoughlins idols PERIOD He could be the next Bob Dylan. it was a great show Ms PERIOD Crowe agreed PERIOD He has a presence on stage PERIOD Hes very friendly and engaging and certainly very talented. colgate has forever been demonstrating its multitude of successful and talented students and Collin McLoughlin can certainly count himself among them PERIOD Whether here at Colgate or outside of it he is definitely one to keep an eye on as he continues to create his musical magic PERIOD
