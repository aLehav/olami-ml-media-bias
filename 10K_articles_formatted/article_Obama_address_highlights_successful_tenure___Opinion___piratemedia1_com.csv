Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Last Tuesday President Obama took the stage to deliver his final State of the Union address to the country he has spent the last eight years serving PERIOD While his speech was not the most rousing exciting or even inspiring address he has given it seemed to reflect his presidency PERIOD Despite unwarranted criticism and opposition the State of the Union showed just how far America has come under Obamas leadership PERIOD

Many have criticized Obamas address claiming that he used the time on stage as a personal platform to discuss what he accomplished in office as president rather than informing Americans what the current state of our country is PERIOD However it is important to grasp exactly what President Obama accomplished while in office to grasp the true nature of our country today PERIOD

He entered the office in  with an economy falling to pieces PERIOD The war on terrorism had reached its seventh year and Americans were losing their jobs as well as their faith in the government PERIOD War fatigue a recession being labeled as the next Great Depression and frustration with seemingly incompetent officials seized the citizenry PERIOD Promising change Obama swore to combat unemployment create a national healthcare system and promote green energy to fight climate change PERIOD

Since  America had its fastest growing economy since  and its unemployment rates have dropped down to  percent PERIOD Thanks to comprehensive reform pushed by the President more Americans are insured than ever before PERIOD The nations energy sectors are making changes to finally go green PERIOD The United States now generates  times more solar power than it did in  PERIOD Numerous other positive changes have been made spearheaded usually not by a divided congress but by our commander in chief PERIOD

When Obama took office in  he promised what all candidates promise to make changes to fix Americas problems and make us a great as we can be PERIOD The numbers show that the president did an admirable job fulfilling those promises PERIOD His State of the Union speech on Tuesday did exactly what it was intended to do it informed Americans that those crises Obama inherited have been resolved PERIOD Now we once again have the hope and resources to make America even greater PERIOD

The President urged that the people use this progress as momentum to fix the challenges that still face us PERIOD He spoke a lot about the growing importance of unity as Americans while approaching the nations problems now and in the future PERIOD He championed an end to the political racial and religious schisms that divide our country PERIOD

The President stressed that his successor be carefully picked lest Americans undo the progress he fought for eight years to achieve PERIOD This along with his justified call for voters to shun hate politics that target peoples race or religion and candidates that lead through anger and anxiety were obvious shots at the Republican Party and more specifically Donald Trump PERIOD Obama made it clear that he thought having a republican in the White House during the next term would undo eight years of work PERIOD

Perhaps this is where some people find it necessary to say that he used this address to talk not about the conditions of our country but to press a political agenda PERIOD I see this as an attempt by the President to one more time remind America of how close the nation stands to a fork in the road after years of hiking to get back onto the trail once again PERIOD Our country in order to remain unified in order to keep our feeling of hope best be certain of which trail we take so that we do not find ourselves off of the path of progress once again PERIOD
