The CGE report was released by Daniel Diermeier provost of the University through an email to the University community on April  PERIOD Diermeier charged the CGE with a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the present state of PhD education at the University. the 108page report which is accompanied by over  pages of appendices includes evaluations and recommendations regarding several issues with the Universitys graduate education programs such as campus climate academic concerns administrative issues and student support PERIOD

The report documents a  percent increase in the number of doctoral degrees awarded from  to  including degrees in health professions and legal studies PERIOD The report associates this increase with growth in the number of fields in which doctorates are awarded and with increases in funding in science and engineering PERIOD

The report also highlights the issues that graduate students face both before and after finishing their programs PERIOD

The crisis in doctoral education takes the form of multiple linked crises changing job markets increasing costs to both universities and students increasing mental health issues in the student population and ongoing lack of diversity in the student and faculty population the report says PERIOD

The committee highlights the need for the University to periodically review the Ph.D PERIOD programs it offers as well as the need for divisions to conduct selfassessments with input from both students and faculty members PERIOD The report recommends Universityrun reviews every  years and selfassessments every five years which could include program completion rates attrition rates and career outcomes for degree applicants PERIOD

CGE student survey findings featured in the report include a trend of decreasing overall student satisfaction over the past  years PERIOD For both satisfied and dissatisfied students the greatest obstacle internal to the University was reported to be the lack of faculty helpfulness reported by  percent of satisfied students and  percent of dissatisfied students PERIOD Other internal factors that were one of the top  obstacles for both groups alike were lack of faculty availability and negative department or research group culture. the report also acknowledges the importance of student insights for the complex system of graduate education recommending that students be offered and be remunerated for roles on advisory boards that pertain to the intellectual professional and material lives of graduate students and the growth of graduate student representation at the highest levels of University affairs. lack of space is associated with decreased graduate housing and a growing undergraduate population PERIOD The report states that graduate student social life is now more narrowly constrained to institutional and departmental spaces. to address the lack of communication and inability to connect students to resources and programs the report proposes the establishment of a graduate student center for individual study group collaborations office hours and socializing PERIOD

Campus climate views from graduate students were discussed in the context of the CGE Student Survey and student focus groups resulting in a recommendation to establish a Universitywide grievance mechanism to help graduate students seek recourse beyond individual divisions of the University PERIOD The committee also suggests for future surveys and research on campus climate to include more comprehensive analysis of the ways in which campus climate affects specific student populations PERIOD

With regard to academic issues timetodegree concerns were mentioned with specific reference to the Humanities and Social Sciences division and the Divinity School where  percent of faculty in the latter reported feeling the time necessary to earn a degree was much too long in the CGE Faculty Survey PERIOD The report encourages an evaluation for all coursework exams and requirements to ensure they are appropriate for inclusion PERIOD The committee uncovered an acute and widespread need for improved advising reporting that students often complain about the lack of clarity regarding program expectations PERIOD The report recommends access to accurate information about requirements expectations and resources for students PERIOD

The CGE Student Survey uncovered that only around  percent of Ph.D PERIOD students were very or mostly satisfied with training for graduate teaching noting a specific lack of mentorship in training PERIOD The report suggests an evaluation of teaching requirements for Ph.D PERIOD programs to ensure requisites are not excessive PERIOD It additionally highlights the need for student teachers to be provided with adequate office and classroom spaces to meet their students PERIOD

In other aspects of graduate education the report featured an analysis of the housing situation for graduate students PERIOD A majority of students reported being mostly satisfied or very satisfied with their housing situation on the CGE Student survey but  percent reported that housing issues were an obstacle to their academic success PERIOD This is linked to the reclassification of International House as undergraduateonly and the sale of graduate student housing previously owned by the University PERIOD Universitymanaged housing units declined from  to  units from  to  PERIOD The committee urges the University to invest in graduate housing support and to conduct regular reviews of graduate housing experiences and needs PERIOD Some suggestions include providing temporary living space for students searching for housing and additional help with moving expenses PERIOD The report further advocates for an assessment of aid for student parents urging the University to provide new student parents with paid leave and for the PhD Child Care Grant budget to increase the  child care subsidy to a level that makes a bigger impact on student parents child care costs. graduate student Sean Blackwella member of the CGE said 

Professor Victoria E PERIOD Prince faculty cochair of the CGE did not respond to requests for comment PERIOD

The report did briefly acknowledge Graduate Students Uniteds GSU recent efforts in unionizing stating in the introduction that the Committee takes no position on whether collective bargaining is the appropriate mechanism for discussing these issues going forward nor is the report intended to deflect circumvent or reinforce the efforts of graduate students to be recognized as employees of institutions of higher education. however the report did advocate for formal mechanisms to represent graduate student viewpoints and interests in matters of concern to graduate students at the University. when asked for comment GSU stated that we are still reviewing the full CGE report which clearly reflects many days of graduate and faculty labor PERIOD One of the most striking parts is the recommendation to establish formal mechanisms to represent graduate students a precise description of the role of a union. we voted by an overwhelming margin a year and a half ago to establish an independent democratic organization to represent our concerns as grad student employees PERIOD Had the university begun bargaining with us instead of calling on members of this committee to document issues that we have been raising for years we could have made substantial progress toward fixing those issues PERIOD If the administration is serious about improving graduate education and working conditions we remain as ready to meet with them as we were in October  the GSU further elaborated in an email to The Maroon PERIOD

University graduate students voted  to  in favor of unionization in fall of  PERIOD Since then GSUs efforts to bargain have been refused by the University administration PERIOD University leadership states that it has no intention to formally recognize GSU and that their stance has not changed at the time of writing PERIOD
