The presidents of all four academic councils have teamed up to establish an interschool academic council which they hope will ease coordination on issues affecting all undergraduate students PERIOD

First conceived during the fall  semester the idea led to a series of group meetings beginning last fall PERIOD This summer the presidents of each council drafted a constitution for their proposal which was then accepted although not yet granted official university support by University Provost James ODonnell PERIOD

In addition to broadening the scope of issues discussed by the respective councils ISAC will streamline certain efforts that each of the councils already pursues PERIOD The collaborative assembly will focus on including major GPAs on students transcripts extending the adddrop period creating a professor rating system that would move the existing system of student evaluations online and addressing other policy concerns shared by the four schools PERIOD

I look forward to working alongside the other schools on universitywide issues mainly because I have found in my experience on the College Academic Council that oftentimes issues that would affect more students than just those in the College are put aside because of the relatively narrow scope of each council said Bettina Bergoo COL  president of the College Academic Council in an email PERIOD Bergoo has served on the College Academic Council since her freshman year PERIOD

In practicum each of the four academic councils regularly discusses academic issues in their respective schools and the issues that plague students PERIOD ISAC discusses those issues and sees if there is any overlap and if so if anything can be done by us to affect positive change said Lowell Karr MSB  president of the McDonough School of Business Academic Council in an email PERIOD

The founding council presidents hope the InterSchool Academic Council will be greater than the sum of its parts PERIOD Together the four schools can achieve a lot more than just working alone and all schools will benefit said Josh Mogil SFS  president of the School of Foreign Service Academic Council in an email PERIOD

Each individual academic council currently holds open weekly meetings to solicit input from the greater student body PERIOD ISAC uses this information to gain a broad understanding of student perspective ISAC representatives said in a joint statement PERIOD

If it is determined that it seems like a schoolwide issue then the council will act upon it but it must be agreed that it is a large enough issue and not just one school wanting something done said Kevin Durbin NHS  cochair of the School of Nursing and Health Studies Academic Council in an email PERIOD I think this will give the whole undergraduate population a means by which they can have a louder voice than in the past on academic issues and hopefully changes can be made quicker with open lines of communication already established. while ISAC is not an official group under any universitysponsored umbrella it has received wide support from the administration as a whole PERIOD

Im still waiting on a formal proposal from the InterSchool Academic Council but Ive met with the proponents and was impressed by their arguments ODonnell said in an email PERIOD

Still in its early stages of formation ISAC aims to become officially recognized as a formal group this academic year Mogil said PERIOD

According to Karr in order to become officially approved by the university the Provost must grant the ISAC formal recognition after they submit the final draft of their constitution PERIOD

ISAC will also work with the Council of Associate Deans the Council of Deans the Registrar and the Main Campus Executive Faculty PERIOD

It was never approved nor does it need to be in order to function but it has been well received by the Registrar Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson the Provost and Council of Associate Deans PERIOD We are in the process of introducing it to many administrators on campus PERIOD All the groups weve talked to are supportive of our efforts and agree that there needs to be a central group of students addressing academic policy Mogil said PERIOD
