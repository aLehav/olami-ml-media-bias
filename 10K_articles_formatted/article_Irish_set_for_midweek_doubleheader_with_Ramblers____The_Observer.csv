Benjamin Padanilam  Wednesday April  

Coming off a sweep of ACC opponent Syracuse Notre Dame will look to continue its current momentum when it hosts LoyolaChicago for a doubleheader Wednesday at Melissa Cook Stadium PERIOD

After a weekend in which they outscored the Orange   ACC by a margin of  runs and only allowed two runs throughout the entire threegame sweep the Irish   ACC will now welcome the Ramblers   MVC to campus for a midweek doubleheader PERIOD

The Ramblers enter the pair of games having won just one of their last five contests PERIOD They were most recently swept in a twogame series with Illinois State this past weekend as they were shutout in both games PERIOD In fact the Ramblers have struggled offensively as of late having only managed to score six runs in those five games PERIOD

One player who has continually found success at the plate for the Ramblers however is sophomore outfielder Shannon McGee PERIOD Amongst players to have started started a game for the Ramblers this season McGee leads the team in batting average . hits  runs  extrabase hits  runs batted in  slugging percentage . and onbase percentage . pERIOD She has also only struck out five times at the dish PERIOD

On the other side the Irish pitchers are coming off perhaps their best weekend of the season PERIOD Freshman righthander Alexis Holloway pitched two complete games against the Orange over the weekend allowing just one run in each game PERIOD She now sports a . earnedrun average this season in  appearances and a  record PERIOD Senior lefthander Katie Beriont also had her best game of the season throwing her first completegame shutout against Syracuse on Sunday while only needing  pitches to do so PERIOD She is now  on the season with a . earnedrun average PERIOD

Offensively one player the Irish hope will find more success at the plate than she has as of late is Cait Brooks PERIOD The junior who has served as the teams designated player for most of the season played left field in both games this past Sunday and is mired in a 1for24 slump at the plate in her last nine games PERIOD However Irish head coach Deanna Gumpf said she thinks Brooks who has struck out just once and walked four times during that ninegame stretch is just experiencing some bad luck at the plate despite good atbats PERIOD

If you look at the quality of her atbats her quality atbats were really good Sunday Gumpf said Sunday PERIOD So I wouldnt even call it a slump because shes putting a good bat on ball PERIOD It just isnt happening for her PERIOD It happens thats the game PERIOD Thats softball. a lineup change the Irish made during Sundays doubleheader was removing senior shortstop Morgan Reed who had been 0for9 in her previous three games and has  errors committed on the season from the lineup for the day and playing sophomore Katie Marino who usually plays second base at short and moving junior Ali Wester from the outfield to second base PERIOD Gumpf said after Sundays doubleheader that she was very pleased with what she say from Marino and Wester defensively up the middle PERIOD

I loved it PERIOD I thought they stepped up big time she said PERIOD I thought they looked great. as far as whether or not that will be a more regular defensive alignment going forward Gumpf said she is more than willing to play the hot hand as she has plenty of confidence in Reed Marino and Wester up the middle PERIOD

It depends on how things are rolling for us Gumpf said Sunday PERIOD It depends on how were handling things and how Morgans playing and how Katies playing and how Alis playing PERIOD So were very fortunate were able to do that. as far as preparing for the Ramblers Gumpf said the game plan is simple PERIOD The Irish will look to take advantage of the doubleheader to continue to build on their recent momentum and prepare them for the upcoming weekend series with Duke PERIOD

I like the fact that were playing two against Loyola thats going to really help us and prepare us for the weekend she said PERIOD

The Irish and Ramblers will square off for two games Wednesday at Melissa Cook Stadium PERIOD First pitch for game one is scheduled for  p.m. while first pitch for the second contest is tentatively scheduled for  p.m PERIOD
