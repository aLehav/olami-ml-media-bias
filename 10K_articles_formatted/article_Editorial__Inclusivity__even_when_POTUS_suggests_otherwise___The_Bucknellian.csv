As calls for diversity and inclusion have become increasingly visible throughout academia society and popular culture targeted efforts to use more inclusive language and messaging have risen to prominence PERIOD

On a national scale there have been many recent examples an NHL Kiss Cam featured its first samesex couple in January  Airbnb announcedan antidiscriminatory policy in September  to combat users discriminating against other users this years New York Fashion Week displayed inclusive and diverse casting while demonstrating solidarity for immigrants and otherwise marginalized groups of people and Tonywinning Broadway musical Hamilton featured a diverse cast and emphasized the role of immigrants in the United States founding history PERIOD

Closer to home the University has made strides toward inclusivity PERIOD In February2016 University President John Bravman announced that the mission statement was updated from men and women to students when referring to those educated at the University.On Feb PERIOD  Sex Weeks I Heart theFemale Orgasm talk featured inclusive nonheteronormative language anecdotes and information PERIOD A Shabbat and Solidarity Dinner was jointly hosted by the Muslim Students Association MSA and Hillel on Feb PERIOD  the first of its kind PERIOD There have also been efforts to implement genderneutralbathrooms into existing or newly constructed buildings on campus though a definite deficit exists and doesnt yet meet the needs of all University students faculty and staff PERIOD

But while undeniable efforts have been made and carried out there is still plenty of room for improvement especially when the civil liberties of the most marginalized people remain in jeopardy PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  the Trump administration released a Dear Colleague letter walking back the policy put in place by the Obama administration to protect LGBTQ students from discrimination concerning the use of the restroom or locker room of their choice PERIOD Obamas directive threatened to pull federal funding from U.S PERIOD public schools if they didnt allow students to choose which locker room or restroom that corresponded to their gender identity Trumps leaves the issue up to states PERIOD

Not only does this new directive imperil the fight for inclusivity in public schools where many students who identify as transgender or gender nonbinary experience discrimination over which facilities to use but it sets the stage for future acts of discrimination based on LGBTQ status PERIOD It will even impact an upcoming Supreme Court case on the same question potentially kicking it back to lower courts PERIOD

It is somewhat heartening to hear that Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos allegedly was at odds with the Trump administration over the issue her immediate tweet affirmed that protections of those who are most vulnerable are critically important PERIOD However words can only go so far and talking the talk is vastly different from walking the walk PERIOD Time will tell whether this assault on individual rights will be upheld or whether the current climate of fighting for inclusivity will champion the issue of bathroom discrimination PERIOD

Going forward the University should draw lessons from the issue playing out on the national stage and bear in mind that inclusivity is the key to success for all its constituents PERIOD Affecting change and making progress with regard to inclusivity is paramount to the success of society and the individuals whocomprise it with the understanding that change can be a long process especially when the groups most affected are not the majority PERIOD
