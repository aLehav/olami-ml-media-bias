Faith is back in Mirrors Edge Catalyst PERIOD

Mirrors Edge Catalyst moves too fast to be contained by E3

Back in  Electronic Arts was in a creative gold period PERIOD A refreshing commitment to new IP had given them one of the strongest third party lineups in history.Dead SpaceSporeRock Band 2andBoom Blox were all new and innovative ideas that thrilled audiences and challenged the publishers convention as a bythebooks studio cranking out yearly sports titles PERIOD But one game stood out from their lineupa sharp parkour platformer by the name ofMirrors Edge PERIOD It was a game that still feels decidedly against the grain PERIOD Rather than a title putting you in the role of an action hero capable of taking on the worldMirrors Edgewas about evasion PERIOD Skillfully leaping through empty warehouses seemingly flying from building to building DICEs unique vision responded with plenty of gamers PERIOD But not enough.Mirrors Edge was a sales flop and the IP was buried as EA shifted towards safer projects PERIOD

Then in  a spark of hope PERIOD At E3 a teaser for a new Mirrors Edge PERIOD Not a sequel not a remake but something PERIOD It was enough to give people hope PERIOD Hope which was then smothered for nearly two years as not a word of the game leaked out of EAs lips PERIOD DICE built Battlefield game after Battlefield game and the silence onME became deafening.But finally the silence has been broken.Mirrors Edge Catalysthas finally been announced taking one step closer to being an actual video game PERIOD As expected well see more at EAs E3 conference next week PERIOD But for now lets enjoy the fact that Faith is back PERIOD

The Guardian is convinced that The Last Guardian is approaching

If the long wait forMirrors Edge fans seems hard try placing yourself in the footsteps of those that are looking forward toThe Last Guardian PERIOD Originally announced back in  for the PlayStation 3The Last Guardian was the third game from Team Ico most known for their work onShadow of theColossus PERIOD TLG followed through on the same gorgeous art style and eye for breathtaking ruins asSotCbut now with the inevitably touching story of a boy and his catdogbirdthing PERIOD Last seen at E3  the story ofThe Last Guardianhas been one of hope beyond reason PERIOD Literally PERIOD Before just about every major press event that Sony attends word spreads over if this will be the day the game finally comes out of hiding PERIOD The six year waiting period has elevated the game into mythos sitting alongsideHalfLife  PERIOD

So what makes  different A pair of rumors have emerged in the past week that have set fan communities aflame with anticipation PERIOD First is that UK newspaperThe Guardian possibly showing bias for their namesake noted that they have heard on very good authority that the game is ready to be shown PERIOD Second an industry insider recently claimed on a podcast that the game is being worked on by none other than Mark Cernydeveloper of Crash Bandicoot as well as system architect for the PS4 itself PERIOD Will any of these rumors manifest as reality Probably not PERIOD But if this is the moment thatThe Last Guardian does become reality allow the record to state the context PERIOD

Dark Souls IIIleaks out makes preparation for death an annual event PERIOD

Typically the preE3 season is identifiable for its near constant string of leaks PERIOD Info gets into the wrong hands and the secrets that companies work months on to reveal under perfect conditions falls online weeks before the big show PERIOD But up to a point  has been a fairly squeaky clean affair PERIOD If news about a game has broken early its typically because the publisher decided to jump the gun themselves PERIOD ButDark Souls IIIjust had to break the streak with a twostage leak that occurred this past week PERIOD First gaming news seriesThe Know which had previously reported the absurd rumor that Microsoft was buyingSilentHills for billions of dollars got ahold of some screenshots that appeared to be from none other than a newDark Souls title PERIOD Considering the shows newfound reputation the screens were met with a fair bit of criticism PERIOD However they were quickly legitimized as IGN obtained leaked promotional art  verifying the numbered title and an early  release PERIOD So whenDark Souls III is announced on Monday try to act surprised okay
