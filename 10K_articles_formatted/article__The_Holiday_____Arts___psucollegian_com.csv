Movie Review

Reviewed by Brianna Labuskes

Seeing The Holiday was like taking a bite of chocolate and discovering a delicious peanut butter center or like opening a birthday card and having a  check fall out PERIOD I went in expecting something good and got something fabulous instead PERIOD

I wasnt the only who thought so either PERIOD I knew it was a hit when I heard the males coming out of the theatre saying  to a movie I had thought would slip into the genre of chick flick PERIOD

The Holiday is about two women who each have problems with love and want to escape their lives PERIOD

Amanda played by Cameron Diaz  In her Shoes  discovers a quaint cottage home in England owned by Iris played by Kate Winslet  All The Kings Men  on a holiday home exchange Web site PERIOD Winslet desperate to flee from the surprise announcement of the engagement of her offagain boyfriend to a coworker had always wanted to go to L.A PERIOD The two set up a house exchange PERIOD They nicely acknowledge the possible doubt from the audience about this idea with Jude Laws  All the Kings Men  line 

After exchanging  the girls set about in different ways to heal their souls PERIOD

Diaz a compulsively neurotic movie advertiser who hasnt been able to cry for more than a decade finds herself unwittingly interested in Iriss charming widower brother Graham played by Law PERIOD

In L.A. Winslet a teary journalistmovie enthusiast discovers two men both equally captivating but decades apart in age  a goofy music composer played by Jack Black and a legendary screenwriter from the golden era of 

The movie was written specifically with the four stars in mind PERIOD Although I cant imagine who else would play the role Diazs performance fell a little flat for me PERIOD As a fan of her more bubbly characters I felt this stereotypical highstrung act felt off as if she tried too hard PERIOD Still she was decent and did not detract from the movie but she didnt bring her usual spark PERIOD

I thought I would have problems watching Law in a romantic role after the whole nannygate shenanigans but his character seemed to fit his natural personality PERIOD He is charming and debonair and a bit of a drunk but compartmentalizes that part of his life when he is with his children PERIOD

Winslet was heartbreaking PERIOD She beautifully captured her Iriss vulnerability around the scoundrel she just hadnt quite gotten over PERIOD She intersperses that with humor and an underlying strength that grows quietly throughout the movie until she eventually has enough  to become 

What more can I say about Jack Black Nacho Libre  that hasnt already been said  he definitely lives up to his good reputation PERIOD The only thing that surprised me was how little he was in the movie PERIOD

I was delightfully surprised to find that this was more than your average chick flick PERIOD The added dimension that made it unique was Winslets new neighbor a 90yearold writing legend PERIOD The interactions between the two are some of the most touching wellwritten and likeable scenes of the movie PERIOD

The Holiday will make you laugh cheer and cry PERIOD And at the end when I walked out of the theatre my own goofy happy grin was matched by almost everyone elses as they commented on just how wonderful the movie was PERIOD This is a movie for everyone PERIOD Grade A
