Before looking at our endorsements we encourage you to read the Macalester College Student Government executive candidates statements on the preceding pages PERIOD After our own reading of their statements and hearing from the candidates at last Tuesdays executive debate we have concluded as a staff that these candidates would best serve the student body in the year ahead PERIOD President We endorse Patrick Snyder PERIOD After five semesters of involvement with MCSG he still sees a need to bridge a fundamental disconnect between the student government and the student body it serves PERIOD Specifically when it comes to MCSGs greatest responsibility  distributing student activity fee money  Snyder has given several engaging ideas for reform such as by making FAC minutes public and thereby encouraging more transparency PERIOD VicePresident We endorse Kai Peterson PERIOD We think Peterson has the experience to make MCSG communicate more proactively and effectively with the student body PERIOD Making MCSG more accessible to students by encouraging them to email in concerns also strikes us as a promising idea PERIOD Academic Affairs Committee We endorse Ezequiel Jimenez PERIOD As this years debate over Russian Studies debate demonstrated students in this role can play a significant part in making big decisions about large changes to the Macalester curriculum PERIOD We think that Jimenezs broad experiences such as being a student representative to the Board of Trustees will serve him well when considering important curricular questions PERIOD Student Organizations Committee Since he is running unopposed it is probably not too much of a surprise that we endorse Jeff Garcia PERIOD He has the wide variety of org participation and org leadership experience required to help this relatively new position evolve and grow PERIOD We look forward to the perspective we expect him to bring to MCSG PERIOD Read the statements contact the candidates with any questions and get your vote in before next Friday PERIOD  refresh
