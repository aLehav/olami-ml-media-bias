Students leave their schoolwork until the last minute professors and advisors suggest helpful solutions PERIOD

Essays endless amounts of reading and writing exams presentations deadlines PERIOD This semester will be different PERIOD Ill start on things right away and falling behind wont be the story of my life this year. right

Wishful thinking PERIOD

This time of the semester students are fullbore in the homework department with the expected weekly reading preparing for tests study groups case studies and the beginning of late night cramming sessions PERIOD

Procrastination seems to be the consensus among some Sacramento State students when asked how they manage their school load PERIOD

When Matthews Banks senior and art studio major was asked if he procrastinates or starts on his homework immediately he said Its a mixture of both PERIOD I study the material right away but the writing part I save for later PERIOD I just turn it in quickly and dont really look at it. so what can faculty members do to give students that extra boost to crack down on assignments

Kathryn Palmieri associate director of the academic advising center said she talks to a lot of students who have trouble managing their schoolwork PERIOD

We offer time management workshops each week during the spring  semester Palmieri said PERIOD

Adam Irby undeclared junior could really benefit from this workshop PERIOD

I always procrastinate Irby said PERIOD I think its bad because I dont learn as much as I could PERIOD Even for the classes I like I still procrastinate. when push comes to shove students often end up at the library stressed and pulling their hair out PERIOD

Library officials have found numerous students in what may not be their proudest moments PERIOD

Ive had students almost ready to cry at the reference desk because they are so stressed out said Linda Goff head of instructional services in the library PERIOD

Goff said that the library offers weekly classes designed to help students narrow their searches and focus their topics so when it does come down to crunch time students have direction and dont stress as much PERIOD

She said the main goal of a librarian is to calm the students down and help them find what they are looking for PERIOD

For some procrastination isnt the issue at all its the manner in which they are assessed that becomes an issue PERIOD

I jump right on it PERIOD Im not a good test taker but if I jump on it and focus I do better said Hien Dao sophomore child development major PERIOD

Something that professors stress all the time in classes is to never leave assignments to the last minute PERIOD Nevertheless its something students tend to do PERIOD

One thing is certain not every student works at the same pace PERIOD

Some students perform better academically when their schedules are busy and some students leave work to the last minute Palmieri said PERIOD

Workshops that are held in both the library and the Academic Advising Center offer extra help to students PERIOD Faculty often wonder if this extra help makes a difference for students PERIOD

Reference librarian Eileen Heaser said the librarians cant be sure if the workshops help but they hope it has some effect PERIOD

We have several types of workshops listed on the homepageWe have basic tours as well as virtual tours for students Heaser said PERIOD

Reasons why students procrastinate can be anything from laziness to lack of time or just completely forgetting about the assignment PERIOD

Some students have unrealistic expectations about the rigor of college coursework or about how much they can accomplish in a week Palmieri said PERIOD

Most students strive to plan ahead and work on assignments as soon as they receive them but there will always be those that pull allnighters glued to computers vigorously typing away PERIOD

Its like a bad habit students dont like to openly admit to procrastinating PERIOD The best they can do is use the tools given to them apply it to their coursework and hope for the best PERIOD
