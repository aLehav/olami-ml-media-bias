Leshoure Limited by Boilermakers

After averaging nearly  yards per game in the teams first five games including four 100yard performances running back Mikel Leshoure has failed to reach the century mark in each of the teams last three games including just  yards on  carries against the Boilermakers on Saturday PERIOD

Its definitely frustrating Leshoure said PERIOD When youve got the defense keying in on you you cant really get going. while Leshoure said he would like to do more he doesnt mind drawing the attention so his other teammates can flourish PERIOD

Im an unselfish guy and they open up other things for my other teammates like Nathan Scheelhaase and Eddie McGee with pulls and stuff like that Leshoure said PERIOD

As long as were executing if its not me its someone else PERIOD Im fine with that. hand injury hampers Henry

When quarterback Rob Henry injured his hand last weekend against Ohio State it presented a difficult decision for Purdue coach Danny Hope PERIOD

He could either start Henry at less than  percent or go with freshman Sean Robinson behind center PERIOD

In the end Hope decided to split time between the two against the Illini PERIOD

However it soon became clear to Hope that Henry would not be able to contribute to the passing game failing to even attempt a pass in the game PERIOD

For the pregame we were under the assumption that he would have a chance being a passer today even though we would have limited the number of passes Hope said PERIOD

I appreciate him wanting to go out there and try to win us a football game. hope said that they really caught us off guard because we had a heck of a game plan and we thought we could manage enough points to score. illinois defensive coordinator Vic Koenning said that once the Illini caught on to Henrys inability to throw it made the gameplan much simpler PERIOD

We figured out after a while that he had not attempted a pass and that he probably wasnt going to Koenning said PERIOD Once we kind of got a feel for what they were doing then we could zero in a little bit.",Injuries a factor for both sides in Illini victory - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
