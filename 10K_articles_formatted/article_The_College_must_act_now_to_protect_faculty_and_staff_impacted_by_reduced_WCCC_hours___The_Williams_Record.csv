On March  the Williams College Childrens Center WCCC announced that it would begin closing at  p.m. citing ongoing staffing issues. faculty and staff with small children now have one less hour per day to do their jobs PERIOD This represents more than a 10percent reduction in childcare hours and hence a 10percent reduction in available work hours for the parents who rely on the Center PERIOD

The reduction in hours was described as temporary but the WCCCs communication to parents made it clear that the Center could not return to its previous schedule until it had filled at least four vacancies and indicated that it had had to close classrooms in recent months because it has been unable to staff them PERIOD This suggests that the staffing challenges facing the WCCC are structural and need urgent attention from the College community PERIOD

Working parents at the College were already struggling after three years of pandemicrelated childcare disruptions PERIOD Faculty and staff take pride in their work in the educational experience we offer Williams students and in the strength of the College community PERIOD Yet even before the latest reduction in hours parents were already exhausted by the continual struggle to balance childcare responsibilities with expectations that we be available outside of childcare hours  for committee meetings that end at  p.m. for College events that are scheduled in the evening and on weekends and for the more informal offhours interactions that enrich the Williams experience for students PERIOD

Now parents with young children are being asked to do as much as they did before with  percent less childcare PERIOD This is simply not possible and the College must make accommodations that recognize that working parents cannot magically do more with less PERIOD Staff with children in the Center should be allowed to leave early and should be given the latitude to eliminate some work responsibilities while the WCCC offers reduced hours PERIOD Faculty with children at the WCCC should be excused from committee meetings that run outside childcare hours and should have their service responsibilities reduced PERIOD This is particularly critical for junior faculty since we cannot modify our teaching loads midsemester and it is not feasible to make tenure expectations contingent on whether one was impacted by unanticipated reductions in the Colleges childcare availability PERIOD

As far as I know the College has not taken any such steps PERIOD It is again asking working parents to do the impossible to meet the same expectations but with substantially less childcare coverage to continue giving more than  percent for their students and for the College when the College is only willing to offer them 90percent childcare PERIOD

I know from firsthand experience that the WCCC provides exceptional childcare PERIOD The staff are loving and professional PERIOD It is a facility that everyone at the College should be proud of PERIOD But faculty and staff with children at the WCCC cannot do fulltime jobs without fulltime childcare PERIOD The College must act immediately to ensure that the Center can continue to offer faculty and staff highquality childcare throughout the workday PERIOD
