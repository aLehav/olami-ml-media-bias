Ashley DowntonApril  

Sacramento State students on financial aid potentially will no longer have to wait for checks to be mailed or prepared for pickup PERIOD

The university is setting up a new module that will allow students to receive financial aid checks through a direct deposit into their bank accounts PERIOD

Gina Curry director of the Student Financial Services Center said the direct deposit program is targeted for release in May to a pilot group of volunteer financial aid students PERIOD

Its great for student service in addition to just being a good business process PERIOD We are in an electronic age so anything electronic is great Curry said PERIOD

Approximately  to  students on financial aid receive at least one check during a semester and  request the check be held for pickup Curry said PERIOD

Checks are issued to students on financial aid when there is a credit balance on the students accounts PERIOD A credit balance results when there is money from financial aid left over after all university fees such as registration and housing have been paid PERIOD

Curry said the program will allow students on financial aid to receive the money in their bank accounts potentially in less than one day instead of waiting days to receive the check before it can be deposited PERIOD

Craig Yamamoto director of the Financial Aid Office said lost or misplaced checks would be eliminated for students enrolled in the program PERIOD

I know that there are some students who lose their checks and have to go through a whole process to get the check reissued Yamamoto said PERIOD

Curry said the Student Financial Services Centers accounting office replaced  to  checks in the last two years because the checks were lost damaged or not cashed within six months PERIOD

Yamamoto said the program would benefit students on financial aid because it is quicker PERIOD

Were here to support the students and we know that they need their financial aid money so they can pay their books pay their parking permit get their books and supplies pay for their dorms or apartments Yamamoto said PERIOD

Suzanne Green university CFO designee for Associated Students Inc PERIOD and associate vice president of Financial Services announced the release of the module at the ASI board meeting on March  PERIOD

During the announcement ASI President Christina Romero smiled in support of the module PERIOD Romero could not be reached for comment PERIOD

Darlene Gillum director of Finance and Administration for ASI said ASI would support the module because it uses direct deposits for employees and payments PERIOD

Gillum said the most beneficial aspect of the module is getting the funds in the hands of students quicker PERIOD

The program will be free for students and is funded through the alluniversity expense budget Curry said PERIOD The budget pays for global programs and services that run the university PERIOD

In order to participate in the program students will have to enroll themselves through the MySacState website and entering their bank accounts and routing numbers PERIOD

Curry said this procedure secures the account information because there is not a written form that has to be submitted PERIOD

It also creates potentially less entering errors when there are multiple people entering the check account PERIOD Youd have to write it down correctly and wed have to enter it correctly PERIOD So anytime you involve the human piece of it theres a chance for errors Curry said PERIOD

Gillum agreed the selfenrollment allows students to keep their bank accounts or routing numbers private PERIOD

Its not written on a piece of paper PERIOD Theyre doing it all online so its not being passed from hand to hand Gillum said PERIOD

Curry said if a student enters in the account number incorrectly the Student Financial Services Center will know in one day of attempting to deposit a check into the students account PERIOD

A paper check will be produced and a notification will be sent to the student to confirm the account number entered online she said PERIOD

The students bank must be enrolled in the automated clearing house program that allows the bank to process direct deposits PERIOD

Students whose banks do not have automated clearing house will have to continue picking up or receiving the checks through mail PERIOD

Gillum said this requirement will affect students who belong to small banks that dont have the direct deposit capabilities or students without bank accounts PERIOD

It may be a good idea to ask your bank before you enroll if they are part of the automated clearing house network Curry said PERIOD

Curry encourages all students who enroll in this program to keep their MySacState password private to prevent access to their bank accounts PERIOD

The university released a password change initiative through MySacState on Thursday to encourage students faculty and staff to do a passphrase change in place of their oneword password PERIOD

It can be a fairly lengthy phrase like Im a Sac State Hornet fan. its very long and very hard for someone to hack or guess Curry said PERIOD

Curry said the use of direct deposits would also cut down on the money spent to produce paper checks PERIOD

She said if  to  percent of students on financial aid enroll in the program the university is estimated to save  in hard costs during the first year PERIOD Curry said hard costs include postage and hard stock PERIOD

Checks go through three offices before they are distributed to students using up time and energy of staff Curry said PERIOD

When were all facing budget cuts in our departments and staffing and trying to do more with fewer staff thats going to be a really good lessening of impact for our offices Curry said PERIOD

Students who are not on financial aid will have access to the service when they receive any overpayment checks from the university PERIOD

Some students will never overpay their accounts and will not have a need to use the program PERIOD
