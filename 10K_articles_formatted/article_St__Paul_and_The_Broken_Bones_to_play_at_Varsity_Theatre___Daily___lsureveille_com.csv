Five notes PERIOD

Five little notes on a guitar riff are all it took for listeners to pay attention to Call Me the breakout radio single from Half the City by St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones PERIOD The septet led by Paul St PERIOD Paul Janeway is one of the newest soul outfits to come out of the South specifically Birmingham Alabama PERIOD

Call Me along with songs like Broken Bones and Pocket Change and Im Torn Up have helped St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones achieve once unheardof goals like reaching the third spot on the iTunes Top Albums chart PERIOD

Before guitarist Browan Lollars arrival into the band frontman Janeway and bassist Jesse Phillips collaborated in a group known as The Grenadines PERIOD Following the writing of the song Broken Bones and Pocket Change the two saw the potential to make something of their musical ability PERIOD

The remaining members of what would become St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones including Lollar were brought together during the recording of the bands first EP PERIOD Half the City was written in six weeks recorded and mastered in the studio among the personal and professional lives of all seven members PERIOD

St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones has now begun the next chapter of its journey  a springtime tour through the United States Canada and parts of Europe PERIOD

As expected Lollar and the rest of the band are excited for their first largescale tour and the opportunities it will bring PERIOD As a professional musician Lollar is aware of the comparisons to other artists that can result from success PERIOD One of the most popular associations is to fellow Alabama soul band Alabama Shakes fronted by the young upstart vocalist Brittany Howard PERIOD

Despite major similarities in genre and inspirations Lollar cited Alabama Shakes as being a soul band with a heavier rock influence than St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones PERIOD

Weve always sort of looked at the two bands as both sides of the same coin Lollar said PERIOD I guess its just an example of us being on the same page as far as inspiration goes PERIOD Alabama Shakes interpret the inspiration a little differently than we do PERIOD Were all really big fans of what they do and hope its mutual. one thing the two bands share is stage presence PERIOD Where Alabama Shakes Howard belts out lyrics while riffing on her guitar Janeway vocally dominates the microphone dancing with moves like that of an evangelical pastor PERIOD

Paul Janeway is just a person that does things the way that he does things Lollar said PERIOD He doesnt really put on any different identities PERIOD Its just sort of Paul. because St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones is primarily a soul outfit Lollar understands his presence as a guitarist PERIOD In a band where vocals and horns make up the majority of the sound he uses his guitar as support stating instrumentation is written for the sake of the song rather than for technical prowess PERIOD

In the wake of the release of Half the City the band has spent the last year sorting out the details of this tour and comprehending how exactly it skyrocketed into the limelight PERIOD

The albums success has lead to multiples occasions for attention including a performance on Late Show with David Letterman and an episode in National Public Radios Tiny Desk Concert series PERIOD

It was an insane year Lollar said PERIOD We went from playing 100cap clubs to 2500cap theaters PERIOD Its gotten so big its hard to see where were at right now. with the tour scheduled to run until July Lollar and his bandmates are already looking to the future of St PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones PERIOD He said the band is currently writing new material focusing on the process of collaboration between all seven members PERIOD

A major concern for the group is the inevitable backlash of a sophomore album PERIOD Despite the major success of Half the City Lollar is reluctant to rest on his laurels PERIOD Themes for this session of recording are evolution and progress PERIOD

We want to take a next step Lollar said PERIOD We dont want to have Half the City Part Two. we want it to evolve and be better. the Half the City tour is scheduled to make a stop in Baton Rouge at the Varsity Theatre PERIOD Though it is a significantly smaller space than normal for the band Lollar said he is excited to play the venue PERIOD The closer quarters equals better show value for the fans allowing Janeway to have more interaction with the audience PERIOD

Since its a small place its going to be a blast Lollar said PERIOD  With this band its not always about playing bigger better places PERIOD Paul can get out in the crowd and touch people PERIOD Its definitely going to be something to remember. st PERIOD Paul and The Broken Bones are scheduled to perform tonight at  p.m PERIOD at the Varsity Theatre PERIOD Doors will open at  p.m. and singersongwriter Sean Rowe will open PERIOD
