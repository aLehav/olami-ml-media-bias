Firefighter Kevin ORourke was a member of FDNY Rescue  and lost his life evacuating WTC on September   PERIOD His helmet can be seen on display in the GroundZero360 Gallery PERIOD

GroundZero360 is an international exhibition highlighting the heroic first responders of  and the surviving families and victims who continue to feel the attacks impact PERIOD

The Arts Council of Brazos Valley will have the exhibition on display from Sept PERIOD  to Nov PERIOD  at their building in College Station PERIOD The council is offering free admission for all members of the community Tuesday through Friday from  a.m to  p.m PERIOD and Saturday from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD It will be closed on Sunday and Monday PERIOD This exhibit was first established in Chicago on the 10year anniversary of the attacks and it has traveled internationally since then PERIOD

For the past three years the directors and organizers of this exhibit had been trying to find an ideal spot for the exhibition to be held in BryanCollege Station PERIOD The arts council building was the best fit said Amy Salvaggio the councils interim director PERIOD This exhibit is being held in a former firehouse with the truck bay serving as the center of the exhibit providing a deeper connection for the families and visitors PERIOD

An integral part of the exhibition is connecting with the families who lost their loved ones in the attacks PERIOD The families are invited to every exhibition to share their stories of survival and cherish the memories of their loved ones PERIOD

Maggie McDonnellTiberio is the wife of Brian Grady McDonnell a specially trained officer in the NYPDs Emergency Services Unit lost during the attacks PERIOD She provided personal artifacts to the exhibition including her husbands Medal of Honor his jacket and a drawing done by his daughter at the time of his death PERIOD These items are extremely personal to the family and McDonnellTiberio said sharing them with communities around the world is a way for the family to keep Brians memory alive and allow people to make a connection with the events of  whether they were there or not PERIOD

This is only about one day in all these peoples lives McDonnellTiberio said PERIOD They were all heroes before  with the types of jobs they choose to do PERIOD I dont want people to always remember that Brian died on  I want them to know that he was a person before that PERIOD He loved his job was a wonderful father and a great husband PERIOD These people chose this job and I would like people to remember the way he lived  not necessarily how he died. along with this personal touch the exhibit consists of many handmade paintings and artifacts PERIOD There are paintings created by James Fitzgerald to accompany the stories of the first responders and structures like a replica of the Survivor Tree created from Ground Zero steel PERIOD There are also voice recordings of dispatch calls made during the attacks featuring the only female NYPD officer to die on Sept PERIOD  Moira Smith PERIOD

When many first responders were killed in the attacks their families were the ones who suffered the most PERIOD Many like McDonnellTiberio had to reevaluate their entire future PERIOD A similar experience took place with Patrick Jackson the brotherinlaw of Kevin ORourke a speciallytrained member of the FDNYs Rescue  PERIOD

Jackson said that after ORourkes death he took the time to reflect on his life compared to his late brotherinlaw and realized that was the man he wanted to be PERIOD Today looking at ORourkes daughters he said he sees the wonderful traits passed on from their father and mother such as selfless service kindness and courage PERIOD

In our families ORourke and his wife were the two perfect people Jackson said PERIOD Whenever I come here Ill bring my tools and work at a homeless shelter because that is who Kevin was PERIOD I tell everybody that I gave up my business after Kevin passed PERIOD For me because I grew up poor it was about having money PERIOD My family was about having money but Kevins way was going to every school function every swim meet every track meet every recital. wednesday will mark the eighteenth anniversary of the attacks increasing the number of people who were either too young or not alive to remember this event PERIOD Salvaggio said because these individuals do not have a personal connection with the event as the older generations do exhibitions like these are important for students to attend PERIOD

Being able to come here and see the images upclose and see the artifacts and learn the stories of the people that were involved really puts that history a bit more in front of your face and makes a bit more of a connection  something that you can really feel Salvaggio said PERIOD
