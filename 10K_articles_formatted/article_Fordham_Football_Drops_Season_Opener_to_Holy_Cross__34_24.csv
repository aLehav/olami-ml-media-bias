COURTESY OF FORDHAM ATHLETICS

Despite a strong offensive performance Fordhams struggles on defense and special teams were costly in the teams game against Holy Cross PERIOD

By CHRISTOPHER MURRAYMarch  

Fordham lost its  spring season opener on Saturday March  to the College of the Holy Cross CHC Crusaders  PERIOD The loss may prove to be particularly devastating as this is one of possibly only four games the Rams will play prior to the Patriot League Championship PERIOD

The two teams took very different approaches on offense throughout the game PERIOD The Crusaders countered Fordhams passheavy attack with a strong running game which Fordham failed to find an adequate answer for PERIOD

For the Rams Tim DeMorat Fordham College at Rose Hill FCRH  had a very solid game PERIOD The star quarterback threw for  passing yards and two touchdowns but also led the team in rushing yards scrambling from the pocket to gain  of the Rams  total rushing yards PERIOD

DeMorat gained more yards through the air than the entire Crusaders offense but Holy Cross also succeeded offensively PERIOD Despite gaining just  total yards on offense the Crusaders found the endzone three times PERIOD

The team will need to reevaluate its gameplan before facing Colgate University on April  as the shortened season leaves little room for error PERIOD

The Rams started the game efficiently disguising the fact that they hadnt played a competitive game in  days PERIOD On the teams first drive Fordham marched into Holy Cross territory before wide receiver Dequece Carter Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill GSBRH  converted a screen into a 46yard touchdown PERIOD Carter would go on to have a fantastic  debut catching  targets for  yards PERIOD

Holy Cross responded swiftly with Derek Ng CHC  connecting on a field goal from  yards out PERIOD Holy Cross got the ball back with  left in the first quarter after a Fordham punt PERIOD The Crusaders drive resulted in another successful field goal for Ng this time from  yards to cut the Fordham lead to one PERIOD The score remained  through the end of the first quarter with the Rams driving down the field as the quarter closed PERIOD

Fordham continued to find offensive success to start the second PERIOD The Rams drove  yards to the Holy Cross 1yard line before running back Trey Sneed FCRH  punched through the goal line for another Fordham touchdown PERIOD After a successful extra point the Rams found themselves with an eightpoint lead  PERIOD



The two teams traded possessions in the forms of punts turnovers on downs and missed field goals before Holy Cross found some momentum PERIOD After another failed drive Fordham found itself lining up to punt from its own 20yard line PERIOD Holy Cross defensive back Terrence Spence CHC  broke through the Rams offensive line and blocked the punt before recovering the ball in the endzone for a touchdown and once again cutting the Fordham lead to just one point PERIOD

Fordham was determined to respond mustering a 49yard drive into the Crusaders red zone PERIOD With six seconds left in the half and seated at Holy Cross 10yard line DeMorat attempted a pass into the endzone which was intercepted PERIOD This play proved to be a momentumshifter as the Holy Cross offense came out much stronger in the third quarter PERIOD

The Xfactor for the Crusaders in the second half was firstyear quarterback Matt Sluka CHC  PERIOD Following a Fordham turnover on downs and a 48yard rush by running back Peter Oliver CHC  Sluka rushed for  yards into the endzone to give Holy Cross its first lead of the game  a lead they would not surrender for the rest of the game PERIOD

After Fordham responded with a 19yard field goal Sluka found the endzone again this time rushing for  yards to extend the Crusaders lead to  before the end of the third quarter PERIOD

Fordhams second half struggles continued in the fourth as the team began with yet another turnover on downs PERIOD Holy Cross capitalized on the turnover with none other than Matt Sluka leading the Crusaders down the field before connecting with Jalen Coker CHC  for an 11yard touchdown with  left in the fourth quarter PERIOD

Fordham quickly drove down the field with DeMorat finding M.J PERIOD Wright FCRH  for a 30yard touchdown once again cutting the Holy Cross lead to  PERIOD The comeback effort however proved to be too little too late PERIOD

A missed field goal by the Rams with  left in the game squashed any hopes Fordham had of coming back PERIOD Holy Cross got the ball back and after a brief drive Sluka knelt to end the game PERIOD He finished the game with  rushing yards two rushing TDs  passing yards and one passing TD leading the Crusaders to the  victory PERIOD

Ultimately the Rams punted just twice in the game while turning the ball over on downs three times PERIOD The Fordham loss drops their season record to  PERIOD The team will need to reevaluate its gameplan before facing Colgate University on April  as the shortened season leaves little room for error PERIOD
