Saint Marys Student Government Association SGA discussed the end of the current administrations term including the state of SGA address and spring allotments at Wednesdays meeting PERIOD

Student body president Rachael Chesley and student body vice president Laura Smith will deliver a state of SGA address at  p.m PERIOD Wednesday in the Student Center Lounge PERIOD The address will replace the weekly SGA meeting PERIOD

As student body leaders we will talk about things weve worked on this year things that didnt pan out things weve accomplished and things we hope continue in the future under the next administration Chesley said PERIOD For instance we would hope the next administration would consider holding the finance seminar before the allotment forms were sent PERIOD That is what happened this year and it would have been better had we had the finance seminar prior to the sending out of forms. chesley said she hopes there is a larger turnout for the address than there was at the open forum held during the fall semester PERIOD Forming connections to the student body is important to the administration she said PERIOD

We want students to care about their student government and to come to this meeting to really know what we do and what we have done Chesley said PERIOD

The next president and vice president for whom elections are today will be invited to introduce themselves to the student body at the address PERIOD

Our goal is to have the smoothest turnover that SGA has ever experienced from Friday when the new SGA president and vice president are elected to the end of our term Chesley said PERIOD I think it should be pretty smooth this year. the transition period between administrations affects the financial deadlines for clubs spring allotments PERIOD

In the weekly treasurers report SGA treasurer Meg Griffin discussed the deadlines the financial committee set PERIOD Spring allotment forms sponsorship and travel grant forms are due March  PERIOD Spring allotment appeals are due March  PERIOD

We made the guideline sheet clear and concise Griffin said PERIOD

SGA will send a list of eligible items for spring allotments and the deadlines for paperwork concerning spring allotments to all club leaders Chesley said PERIOD It will also be available on the SGA website PERIOD
