Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

Jorge Montezuma a Cal Poly undergraduate doesnt live his life like the average college student in their own world of text messaging iPod listening and sporting the latest Go Green  Tshirt that only gives off the image of being environmentally aware. he enjoys the simplicity of riding his bike everywhere not only because its fun for him but also because he thinks its better for the environment PERIOD

Montezuma works for the organic farming enterprise project class and says that tasks such as recycling taking a phone charger out of the wall if its not being used and buying locallygrown organic foods are just part of his everyday life PERIOD

Montezuma a sincere and gentlespoken environmental engineering senior has said he long ago made the personal choice to help the planet as best he can PERIOD  I just try to talk to people to make them realize that theres more than just wanting to buy things you have to be a conscientious consumer because individual decisions matter a lot when it comes to the environment he said PERIOD

Sustainable development meets the needs of the present population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs PERIOD

At Cal Poly sustainability has begun to permeate all aspects of the campus whether it is taught in the curriculum embedded in research done by faculty and students or in the actual structures on campus PERIOD

Four years ago Cal Poly President Warren Baker signed The Talloires Declaration which states that the university must lessen the problems of environmental pollution and degradation and the depletion of natural resources PERIOD

Cal Poly recognizes that sustainability is one of a handful of defining issues in the twenty-first century and that universities have a particular responsibility to give high priority and visibility to the issue of sustainability Baker said to the CSU Board of  Trustees in September PERIOD

So far the campus has saved  grown trees  pounds of landfill  pounds of greenhouse gas emissions  gallons of water and  million BTUs of energy according to the Second Biennial Progress Report for Cal Poly facilities and operations PERIOD

Though the interest and awareness of sustainability has deepened over the years it is an ongoing project for the Cal Poly community and supporters say the campus has only scratched the surface when it comes to environmental issues PERIOD

Recently Cal Polys student involvement in sustainability was graded as a C from Greenreportcard.org with the campus getting an overall evaluation of a B. the site only mentioned two instances of student involvement on Cal Polys campus the California Alliance to Save Energys Green Campus Program and  student groups that have joined forces to create the Empower Poly Coalition PERIOD Greedreportcard.org failed to mention that the coalition is a much larger umbrella organization that unites over  clubs together in their efforts to promote sustainability among Cal Poly PERIOD

In response to the meager grade Montezuma said I think theres a lot more going on on campus PERIOD I went on the Web site and checked out UCLA we have some of the same clubs and they got an A.

Ben Eckold the president of the Empower Poly Coalition also disagreed with the grade because the administration got a better grade than the students he said PERIOD

Campus dining received an A from the Web site largely due to the efforts of Associate Campus Dining Director Alan Cushman who has been involved with sustainability since the 1980s when composting first began on campus PERIOD

The university was slow to join in Cushman said when talking about attempts to make the campus more sustainable PERIOD

Currently he is partnering with the Biodiesel Club to convert all the Campus Dining trucks to run on biodiesel fuel PERIOD Since the trucks that currently run on cooking oil have to purchase it from another vendor the main objective of the club is to eliminate the middleman and build a processor to convert the campus dining cooking oil into biodiesel right on campus PERIOD

In addition to the Biodiesel Club theres also the Zero Waste club the Fair Trade club Engineers without Borders the Cal Poly Organic Farm and many more in the coalition PERIOD

Theres a greater voice in the student body because of them the Empower Poly Coalition Cushman said PERIOD

Montezuma is the external vice president of the Empower Poly Coalition as well as the President of the Sierra Student Coalition the nations oldest and largest grassroots environmental organization PERIOD

He was born in Lima Peru which he described as overcongested and overpopulated. his father a mechanical engineer had a tourism company which sent the family to a variety of places such as San Jose and Costa Rica PERIOD Eventually Montezuma and his family ended up back in Peru where his mother worked for the environmental department in the city PERIOD While visiting his mother at work Montezuma realised that he loved science and math and decided to choose that career path as well meaning he had already decided his future before moved to the United States PERIOD

Montezuma said he no longer tries to separate his involvement in sustainable organizations and his academic endeavors from his personal life PERIOD

Some people try to put work here school here and life over here he explained while sitting on the grass barefoot his bike next to him PERIOD But back in the day you lived to work and the concept of fun was built into work. montezuma said PERIOD I dont think its a bad thing to mix everything you just have to find a balance. interest in sustainability has expanded on campus since the last SARC Sustainable Agriculture Resource Consortium meeting and enrollment in the organic farming class has increased PERIOD

Tom Neuhaus professor of food science and nutrition and advisor to The Fair Trade club believes more people are aware of environmental issues on campus PERIOD   But making measurable progress toward a more sustainable university is a constant battle he said PERIOD

This campus has a reputation of being very passive concerning sustainability and its time for that to change he said PERIOD

Brigette Bonfiglio a Fair Trade Club representative and nutrition senior  thinks each and every person can help to encourage positive change on campus PERIOD

I joined the club my last year at Cal Poly because I felt like it was time for me to be active on campus and try to make a difference she said PERIOD

Bud Evans a political science professor that teaches an array of courses centered on the concept of sustainability agrees with Montezuma that there needs to be more advocacy on campus PERIOD

What Ive observed with Poly is that it talks right but it doesnt really come through and deliver except when it is really forced to he said PERIOD

HowardGreene explained the campuss priorities on the subject of sustainable development PERIOD

He said that it is important to the administration to maintain the campus in a sustainable way not only because its the right thing to do but also because it creates teaching and research opportunities by doing that. yet the number one priority for the administration is educating and exposing students to sustainable development within the educational programs on campus PERIOD  The creation of majors minors and other classes relating to sustainability has already begun HowardGreen said PERIOD

Were working across the curriculum in ways in which we can engage in sustainability he said PERIOD In the administrations sense the biggest impact that Cal Poly will have on sustainability both in the nearterm and longterm is in the kind of students that we graduate. examples of sustainable practices on campus include a recent energy audit of the campus constructing buildings to be LEED certified recycling and reducing the consumption of energy on campus PERIOD

The new Poly Canyon Village is contracted to be LEED certified and the Faculty Offices East Building  has been chosen as the first demonstration building to be submitted for certification in the spring of  PERIOD

In the end faculty students and the administration seem to agree this campus is making progress to become even more sustainable and that the students efforts are in fact making a difference PERIOD

Weve had a tremendous amount of growth in grassroots activity on campus HowardGreene said PERIOD

After finishing Cal Poly and getting work experience in his field Montezuma would like to return to South America to help a community work on sustainable development PERIOD

I want to connect many organizations that are doing the same thing with sustainable development in developing countries and have them share experiences he said PERIOD Involvement has become a part of my life now its not bad its just my life. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
