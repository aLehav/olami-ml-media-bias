At the beginning of May  of all Chicagoans had received at least one dose of the COVID19 vaccine with those in the  age group having the lowest rate of vaccination according to Allison Arwady commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health PERIOD

More than half of both white and Asian Chicagoans in that  year old group have gotten at least their first dose but only  of Latinx and  of Black Chicagoans have gotten their first dose Arwady told a select group of student journalists from Chicagos colleges and universities on May  PERIOD

We are concerned that the youngest Chicagoans that have been eligible for the vaccine are the least likely to have taken the vaccine Arwady said PERIOD

The CDPH is creating incentives for young people to get vaccinated through initiating events such as concerts and music festivals PERIOD The Protect Chicago Music Series announced May  is a series of monthly music events for fully COVID19 vaccinated Chicagoans where attendees must provide their CDC vaccination card upon entry PERIOD

Additionally as of May  all Chicago businesses have the option to institute vaccine exemption which exempts fully vaccinated individuals from an establishments COVID19 capacity guidelines PERIOD

Arwady said Chicago has the highest vaccination rates among the nine largest cities by population in the country and the highest Latinx and Black vaccination rates for the first dose but she added that there is still a long way to go locally and nationally PERIOD

The citys Protect Chicago initiative was the citys way to ensure vaccination equity in neighborhoods that were disproportionately impacted by COVID19 and encountered numerous vaccination barriers such as a lack of primary care providers PERIOD

On April  Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CDPH announced a  million request for proposals from the CDC to establish Healthy Chicago Equity Zones dividing the entire city into six geographic areas to ensure racial equity in healthcare and healthrelated resources PERIOD The communityled efforts will begin with vaccine outreach in the neighborhoods most impacted by COVID19 PERIOD

Arwady said the equity zones are a way to connect with trusted community based organizations such a faith groups food pantries and violence prevention programs PERIOD

It starts with COVID  the goal is that this becomes something that we build on as additional funding becomes available Arwardy said PERIOD

Arwady said  of people trust their physicians recommendation to get vaccinated followed by recommendations from family and friends PERIOD Public health officials are least trusted among the three emphasizing the importance of community involvement in the vaccination process PERIOD

Arwady cited a vaccine ambassador course launched by the City Colleges of Chicago and the CDPH on May  as a way to include members of the community without a health background in vaccine education and advocacy PERIOD

The free twohour online course is in partnership with Rush University and Partners In Health and will cover the history of vaccines myth busting and tips on how to have conversations about the COVID19 vaccines PERIOD Ambassadors will receive a certificate upon completion of the course and will be connected to multiple vaccine outreach efforts to increase vaccination across the city PERIOD

Folks who are interested in being a part of this community of Chicagoans who are really interested in getting their friends and neighbors vaccinated  have a certificate that shows they have some basic training in it PERIOD It lets us feel confident about having them going out knocking on doors and being part of our outreach work Arwady said PERIOD
