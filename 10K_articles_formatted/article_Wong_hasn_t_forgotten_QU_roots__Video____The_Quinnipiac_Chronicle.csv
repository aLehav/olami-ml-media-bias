At a postgame interview at the TD Bank Sports Center Friday night a minor league hockey player sported his old Quinnipiac undershirt PERIOD With a wide grin and a laugh the player said I just cant let it go. for the first time since his graduation Quinnipiac mens ice hockey star Brandon Wong returned to the ice at the TD Bank Sports Center PERIOD Wong has hung up his Quinnipiac uniform and is now playing in Hartford Wolf Pack gear PERIOD

The Wolf Pack the New York Rangers top minor league affiliate picked up a  victory over the Bridgeport Sound Tigers Friday in which Wong tallied his second preseason point of the year PERIOD Luckily for Quinnipiac fans the Wolf Pack scheduled a preseason game at the Bank for the  campaign facilitating Wongs return to Hamden PERIOD

Wong sporting the unfamiliar red white and blue Wolf Pack sweater was first to the ice following starting goaltender Chad Johnson PERIOD Wong made his first appearance  into the first period fittingly on the powerplay where he scored  out of his  goals in his senior season PERIOD Those  powerplay goals were a Division Ihigh last season PERIOD

The hometown Hamden fans welcomed him warmly as soon as he made his way over the halfboards PERIOD

It was nice to have that great support Wong said PERIOD It was a very nice showing by the fans tonight for the game. just as he did on his many powerplay shifts with the Bobcats Wong immediately made his way to the front of the Bridgeport net after Hartford won the faceoff searching for a deflection PERIOD

As the games scoring opened up it was apparent to everyone in attendance that Wong had to get in on some of the action that was to come PERIOD And they didnt have to wait long PERIOD

Just  after the Wolf Packs first goal Wong made his way over the blue line on the far side and sent a backhand pass to an open MarcOlivier Vallerand in the slot PERIOD Vallerands goal proved to be the gamewinner but the one point wasnt enough for Wong PERIOD It was the game winner but it was too bad I couldnt pocket one. his first point back at the Bank was accompanied fittingly by the playing of Lionel Richies All Night Long or as QU fans may remember it All Night Wong. with the announcement of Wongs assist the crowd awarded him with yet another warm round of applause PERIOD

When asked about his former theme song and whether or not he heard it Wong had a good chuckle and a big smile on his face remarking Oh yeah I did and that was real nice too. the third period awarded fans with plenty of scoring as all six goals were scored in the third period PERIOD Along with the scoring were some physical plays and one scary moment for fans PERIOD

Off a slap shot from the blue line Wong was struck in the face with the puck after a deflection PERIOD

Wong was down on the ice for a little bit but was able to get back up and continue playing after a short time on the bench PERIOD After the game Wong was still bleeding where the puck had struck him between his bottom lip and chin PERIOD

After graduating from Quinnipiac last year Wong signed an amateur tryout agreement with the Grand Rapids Griffins an affiliate of the Detroit Red Wings organization PERIOD Wong played in three games with the Griffins pocketing one point in his time there PERIOD Wong said he really enjoyed his time in Grand Rapids even if it was only for three weeks PERIOD

At the end of the year I got three games with them and was there for three weeks Wongs said PERIOD I got to practice with them and see how things worked PERIOD It was a good old taste of the pro life at the AHL level. in one of his first preseason appearances with the Wolf Pack Wong scored a point on an assist in a  victory PERIOD

Im really just trying to get my game back he said PERIOD I am a twoway player just trying to make plays. if Wong can impress the Wolf Pack coaching staff enough he might be able to make it to the next level PERIOD Wong would only be the second Quinnipiac alum to dress in the NHL PERIOD In addition Wong would be the first NHL player with full Chinese descent to hit the ice PERIOD

Reid Cashman a  alum saw AHL action with the Toronto Marlies affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs but never played NHL minutes PERIOD The road to the pros for Wong is a tough one and he knows it PERIOD

The guys up here are a lot stronger and faster and it is a different game PERIOD I just have to keep learning working hard and adapting and hopefully I can get that shot to play. photo credit Charlotte Greene
