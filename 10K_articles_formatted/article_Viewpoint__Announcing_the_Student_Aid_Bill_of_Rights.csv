In an economy increasingly built on innovation the most important skill you can sell is your knowledge PERIOD Thats why higher education is more than ever the surest ticket to the middle class PERIOD

But just when its never been more important its also never been more expensive PERIOD The average undergrad who borrows to pay for college ends up graduating with about  in student loan debt PERIOD

Thats why my Administration has worked hard to make college more affordable PERIOD We expanded tax credits and Pell Grants enacted the largest reforms to the student loan program in history and fought to keep interest rates on student loans low PERIOD Weve acted to let millions of graduates cap loan payments at  percent of their incomes so they dont have to choose between paying the rent and paying back their debt PERIOD Ive sent Congress my plan to bring the cost of community college down to zero because two years of higher education should be as free and universal as high school is today PERIOD

And this week I unveiled another way that we can help more Americans afford college PERIOD It doesnt involve any new spending or bureaucracy PERIOD Its a simple declaration of values  a Student Aid Bill of Rights PERIOD

It says Every student deserves access to a quality affordable education PERIOD Every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college PERIOD Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan PERIOD And every borrower has the right to quality customer service reliable information and fair treatment even if they struggle to repay their loans PERIOD

Thats it PERIOD Just a few simple principles PERIOD But theres a lot that colleges lenders and the people you send to Washington can and should do to live up to them PERIOD

Consider the other actions I took this week PERIOD Were creating a way for borrowers to ask questions about their loans or file a complaint and get a fast response PERIOD Were going to require businesses that service loans to provide clear information about how much students owe and their options for repaying it and help them get back in good standing if theyre falling behind with reasonable fees on a reasonable timeline PERIOD Were also going to take a hard look at whether we need new laws to strengthen protections for all borrowers wherever their loans come from PERIOD

If you believe in a Student Aid Bill of Rights that will help more Americans pay for a quality education Im asking you to visit WhiteHouse.govCollegeOpportunity PERIOD Sign your name to this declaration PERIOD Tell your families friends and fellow students PERIOD Im going to ask Members of Congress and lenders and as many business leaders as I can find PERIOD Because making sure that students arent saddled with debt before they even get started in life is in all our interests PERIOD

This issue is personal to me PERIOD My grandfather had a chance to go to college because this country decided that veterans returning from World War II should be able to afford it PERIOD My mother was able to raise two kids by herself in part because she got grants that helped pay for her education PERIOD And Michelle and I are where we are today because of scholarships and student loans PERIOD We didnt come from families of means but we knew that if we worked hard wed have a shot at a great education PERIOD Thats what this country gave us PERIOD

In America a higher education cannot be a privilege reserved only for the few PERIOD It has to be available to everyone whos willing to work for it PERIOD

Barack Obama is the President of the United States PERIOD
