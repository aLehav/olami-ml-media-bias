Baby she was born to run PERIOD

But ever since a tackle left her slow to get up against Ohio State on Sept PERIOD  Maddy Evans could only watch her teammates on the Penn State womens soccer team as they kept rolling up wins in the Big Ten PERIOD But two weekends ago the junior midfielder returned to the glory days of earlier in the season PERIOD

It feels absolutely incredible Evans said of her return PERIOD Something was missing from my life and Im glad Im back. evans who sprained her ankle in the first half of that contest against the Buckeyes returned to the field against Michigan State but she did not play in October 23s win over Michigan PERIOD Evans did play in Friday nights  win over Purdue missing a total of five and a half games but she wasnt expecting that long of a break PERIOD

The midfielder said she was readying for a cross when an Ohio State defender slid in PERIOD Instead of striking the ball Evans hit the other girls heel leading to a pretty severe sprain PERIOD

However the junior said she thought she was going to go back in that game but it didnt work out PERIOD Evans said she sprained four different parts of her ankle with three clearing up quickly but the fourth lingering PERIOD

It was definitely tough because I felt like there was some momentum going but I have complete faith in all of my teammates who were able to step into that role Evans said before the trip to Michigan PERIOD Im excited to see it all continue. against the Spartans the midfielder played only  minutes but marked her return with a bang PERIOD In the seventy-fifth minute Evans got the ball after a scramble in front of the net and hammered home her second goal of the season from five yards out PERIOD

Evans said there was still a little pain in her ankle but she added the training staff had found a good tape job that would let her play PERIOD As an outside midfielder Evans game is built on running and taking defenders oneonone something she wasnt able to do with her injury PERIOD

But having to sit out may have been a blessing in disguise PERIOD As one of the most fit players on the team and someone who wants to be on the field the break seemed like a recharge for the junior PERIOD

When she came back and she was training she looked like it was August fifteenth and she was just back from the summer Penn State coach Erica Walsh said PERIOD She was flying around the field and when Maddys flying around good things happen. evans is just happy to be back with her teammates working on a dream PERIOD The Lions have aspirations of a deep postseason run and with the Big Ten tournament this week the junior wingers engine will be a big piece to capturing a title PERIOD

She brings so much energy Walsh said PERIOD Maddy is just a different class of athlete and her personality is so big for this team just a pure enjoyment of training we miss a lot when Maddys not on the field. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
