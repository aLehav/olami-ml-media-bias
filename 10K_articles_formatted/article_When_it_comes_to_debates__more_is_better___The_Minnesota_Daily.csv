5021,2023-11-04,"the public deserves the most vigorous debate season the candidates can provide PERIOD

Published  September  

Presidential debates have become an integral part of the political process PERIOD Debates such as those between thenpresidential candidates Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas or between John F PERIOD Kennedy and Richard Nixon are historical events in and of themselves PERIOD

More recently the debates between President George W PERIOD Bush and former Vice President Al Gore where Bush exceeded previous low expectations and proved himself a formidable opponent clearly had an effect on the  presidential election PERIOD

The public deserves the most vigorous debate season the candidates can provide PERIOD Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Sen PERIOD John Kerry must debate as often as possible and in uncontrolled situations PERIOD Currently Kerry has agreed to three debates PERIOD Bush has not officially said how many debates he prefers but aides have said there should be no more than two PERIOD Three debates should be the bare minimum PERIOD For example Nixon and Kennedy squared off four times in  PERIOD

While both candidates are maintaining a blistering campaign schedule the electorate and especially those not living in swing states deserves at least a substantial amount of live television exposure to both Bush and Kerry PERIOD

Empirical totals aside the format is central to the debates informative value PERIOD Townhall style debates are more fluid and unpredictable than conventional ones giving the public a better idea of candidates beliefs values and character PERIOD Frankly while conventional debates have up sides they can become little more than free campaign ads and rather longwinded ones at that PERIOD

While neither candidate has agreed to any debates using the townhall format four years ago Bush wanted to use unconventional forums instead of their more staid counterparts PERIOD We enthusiastically agree PERIOD

While there might be some benefit to one conventional debate where each candidate could explain his vision in detail the more candid discussions offer a better perspective on how and what Bush and Kerry actually think about issues including Iraq health care education and gay marriage PERIOD

If either or both candidates balks at or hinders the negotiations currently setting these debates the electorate should interpret that lack of candor as an attempt to hide something PERIOD
