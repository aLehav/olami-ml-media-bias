Showers early then partly cloudy overnight PERIOD Low around 50F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD Chance of rain  PERIOD

Updated November     pm









Andrew Sigman a former ROOTS employee sits outside of the University Temple United Methodist Church in the U District where the ROOTS young adult shelter is located PERIOD

Before he was fired Dale Hamlin was revered as the most fitting person for his line of work PERIOD Homeless at one point Hamlin turned his life around earned a degree in sociology and has worked for over  years giving back helping those in similar positions get back on their feet PERIOD

Coming out of retirement to return to this work Hamlin began last February as an oncall worker at ROOTS a shelter located just off the UW campus and focused on assisting young adults experiencing homelessness PERIOD

Hamlin was still an oncall worker after one year the longestserving on the staff PERIOD

You want someone there whos been through it all Hamlin said PERIOD You think theyd be fighting for that guy on their staff. hamlin and his coworker Andrew Sigman were fired earlier this week despite intentions to continue serving the young adult population at ROOTS PERIOD

Concerns over hiring and training

In this year Hamlin has watched the shelter destabilize and struggle with staff turnover PERIOD Also during this time he has received several rejections from management while key positions have gone unfilled for months PERIOD

Several times Hamlin applied for program manager positions and was rejected with no explanation even in facetoface interactions asking for one or received no response at all regarding his application PERIOD This experience is not unique to Hamlin PERIOD Jesse Dunn a former ROOTS supervisor experienced the same process of seemingly sending his application into a void PERIOD

We had the same experience Dunn said PERIOD They treated me and Dale and other people horrible in that process  like we were worthless to them. though he feels the program managers that have been hired are good at their jobs Dunn also feels that management has made mistakes by not looking at the talent they have inhouse PERIOD

Training for staff and volunteers is inadequate according to Hamlin PERIOD The shelter does not teach its staff or volunteers procedure on what to do if law enforcement comes to the door or teach first aid or until very recently how to administer naloxone  medication used to block the effects of opioids in the event of overdoses. in the event of a guest having a seizure which may happen several times in a night responsibility has fallen to another guest to respond PERIOD

That shouldnt be the job of a guest Hamlin said PERIOD

One guest Kendra Beaman who uses a wheelchair and is near nine months pregnant spoke with The Daily and said ROOTS fails to accommodate for disabled guests PERIOD Many nights there were no workers present who knew how to operate the wheelchair lift she recalled if it were even functional PERIOD

In another instance ROOTS failed to find an interpreter to communicate with a deaf guest PERIOD ROOTS approach to disabled guests is not described as one of urgency PERIOD Accomodations often also come with financial burdens that may limit ROOTS PERIOD

Its like deal with it on a casetocase basis Liliya Shtikel former ROOTS program manager said PERIOD Instead of acting reactionary but planning for all those things is how ROOTS can improve. other ROOTS staff agreed training could be better but said it is unrealistic to expect volunteers to be trained for all of the many unpredictable situations that may arise in a shelter PERIOD

Hamlin and multiple guests of ROOTS all expressed that they feel management too often looks to young inexperienced applicants that guests do not feel are approachable PERIOD Hamlin described that many new hires for whom he was passed over often approach him with questions of how to do parts of the job PERIOD

Current ROOTS employee Dale Hamlin who is committed to helping the homeless said 

Three ROOTS guests spoke with The Daily and all identified Hamlin as the most approachable on staff PERIOD To them his life experiences made him more understanding of their hardships PERIOD

Dales been through it like us Richard Soiseth a former ROOTS guest said PERIOD

Antioppressive and lack of representation

Guests and staff alike brought up the glaring problem of the ROOTS staffs lack of representation among workers and volunteers especially relative to the diversity of the guest population PERIOD

ROOTS volunteers and staff not matching the identity and experiences of our guests is a massive problem Dunn said PERIOD

Much of the work Dunn did at ROOTS was centered around antioppression work for people of color POC PERIOD

They the management seemed very excited by the feedback that I brought Dunn said PERIOD Theres definitely a willingness but I think the bigger issue is that they simply dont know how to make our staff and volunteer base more diverse and they arent willing to go out of their way to figure out how. at the foundation of ROOTS Dunn explains is the idea that homelessness and other inequities are the result of systemic inequality poverty and all the isms. they believe that in order to gain equity there must be an active emphasis to ensure oppression is not happening in their spaces PERIOD Volunteers and staff at ROOTS are required to undergo antioppression training after being hired PERIOD

They really prop themselves up as antioppressive thats like their fking buzzword Dunn said PERIOD In my opinion they are not antioppressive PERIOD In fact I have seen on multiple occasions management be oppressive towards both guests and staff members. one way that were experiencing major growing pains is that over the last year weve gotten a lot better at identifying instances of oppression Jordan Beaudry volunteer services manager said PERIOD But our ability to respond to instances of oppression has not grown at the same rate. some guests of the shelter felt POC especially AfricanAmericans have been disproportionately targeted with leaves temporary bans from the shelter PERIOD One of these leaves according to guests was granted in response to a guest emailing management over concerns of a particular employee PERIOD

Beaudry said he has heard anecdotal evidence of this but is in the process of compiling and analyzing data so if this is a problem they better know where to respond PERIOD

Throughout the course of The Dailys reporting ROOTS executive director Kristine Scott was routinely described as abusing her power in the organization PERIOD

Tension and transparency

The relationship between guests and management and staff and management has worsened dramatically in recent months following the departure of shelter manager Kathleen Murphy PERIOD Officially Murphy resigned her position but some guests and staff feel she was fired forced out by Scott PERIOD

The abrupt departure of Murphy left some staff and guests angry and looking for answers PERIOD Every member of the staff signed a letter asking for an explanation PERIOD No explanation has been given PERIOD

In response the ROOTS board of directors held a public forum for staff and guests to voice their frustrations PERIOD

When the staff appealed to the board and  their response wasnt letting Kristine go it was seen as completely inadequate they felt helpless Sigman now a former ROOTS oncall worker said PERIOD

In the process of reporting this article The Daily learned that both Sigman and Hamlin had their employment terminated PERIOD

Sigman spoke openly of the issues he sees within ROOTS despite the risk he felt it put on his job PERIOD Hamlin also expected that publicly raising concerns like he now has will result in him not being able to return to ROOTS PERIOD

I thought I would have been asked to leave a long time ago Sigman said PERIOD I think many other people would speak out but theyre scared of losing their job. on Tuesday The Daily was notified by Sigman that he had been fired by Scott with no explanation given PERIOD Sigman suspects it is in response to his speaking out more in the past week via internal emails against acts of oppression he saw as well as his refusal to attend a debriefing that he feels would lead to no improvements. i was going to get fired or Scott there was no other way Sigman said in a text Tuesday night PERIOD I had to try PERIOD Im so sad though as I volunteered overnights for so longer before I even worked there PERIOD Ive known some of those guests for years and its really over. richard Soiseth a former ROOTS guest stands outside the ROOTS young adult shelter PERIOD Soiseth said 

By Wednesday Hamlin too had his employment at ROOTS terminated PERIOD The email notifying Hamlin of his firing cited a failure to follow ROOTS Personnel Policies after a clear warning and gross insubordination. according to Hamlin he never received any significant disciplinary notes and was not given any performance evaluations saying I never made any trouble whatsoever and I did my job. im pretty sure that the article had something to do with it Hamlin said PERIOD I knew what kind of chance I was taking but I felt like the lives of those young people were more important PERIOD I just hope that something happens as a result to make things better for them otherwise it was all for nothing. sigman feels management holds employees jobs over their heads and takes advantage of the staffs commitment to the shelter PERIOD

If this was another kind of business we could have all walked out and shut it down Sigman said PERIOD But we cant do that because we dont want the youth to sleep outside PERIOD And they know that PERIOD Thats what upsets me the most PERIOD Theyre using our love for the guests as a weapon against us. for Shtikel the departure of Murphy and the events that followed led her to leave ROOTS in November after working for over four years PERIOD

I think it was a big move Shtikel said of the letter PERIOD To have nothing come from that it was defeating PERIOD What incentive do people have to speak out if they arent heard

Disdain from guests toward management has been growing due to a perceived lack of transparency and feeling of exploitation PERIOD Scott is described as rarely to never interacting with guests except when she needs something such as finding guests to speak at fundraising events on behalf of the organization PERIOD

Guests expressed that they felt used in these situations and were frustrated that the conditions of ROOTS were not improved following these fundraisers PERIOD Guests petitioned management for information about how ROOTS is spending its money and their request was not granted until filing for a copy of the organizations Form  from the IRS PERIOD

Every guest and staff member The Daily spoke with believes management and the board of directors are too disconnected from guests and the shelter experience PERIOD The dysfunction and tension that has grown between staff and management has led to multiple employees leaving ROOTS including Dunn last month PERIOD

I loved the work PERIOD I love the guests PERIOD It was going to take a lot for me to quit and a lot happened Dunn said PERIOD

Dunn and Shtikel both identified the need for a culture change at ROOTS and that culture starts at the top PERIOD

A lot of organizational culture comes from the top down Shtikel said PERIOD If folks who work there and guests who stay there are complaining about lack of trust accountability and transparency that comes from somewhere right Leadership determines a lot of things and how an organization runs is going to be reflective of the people on top. when The Daily met with Scott on Monday she said she thinks the perception of disconnect is not accurate PERIOD She also disagreed with the negative culture between staff and management as characterized by the staff that spoke with The Daily PERIOD

When people are dissatisfied sometimes a groupthink occurs Scott said PERIOD It feels like some of the folks you talked to are feeding each other misperceptions so I appreciate that youre digging into whats accurate. hamlin Sigman and the guests were not as measured in identifying Scott as the root problem PERIOD Each directly called for her removal as executive director PERIOD For some this was not the first time PERIOD

People do tend to look to the leader of an organization Scott said in response to this PERIOD She analogized the situation to that of Wells Fargo in  PERIOD Is this one of those situations Thats the boards decision. the sentiment among ROOTS guests staff and past employees that The Daily spoke with was that a new shelter director and new executive director who can offer a fresh perspective are needed to turn the organization around PERIOD Some felt the need for change strongly enough to jeopardize their jobs professional reputation or shelter to again try to have their voice heard PERIOD

Because I know there are better people even within ROOTS that can run that place better Soiseth said on why he calls for the removal of Scott as executive director PERIOD

Shtikel hopes ROOTS can regain its stability continue being a great shelter for the community and remain a great place for staff and volunteers to learn and grow PERIOD

Theres a lot of bada people doing bada things its a great shelter but needs a new director Dunn said PERIOD I dont want people to give up on ROOTS. reach reporter Devon McBride at newsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter DevonM98













Pretty sure that there is not a consistent way to communicate with the guest that is deaf PERIOD Staff are often using text messaging if she has a phone available and slide laminated signs under the bathroom door.. PERIOD and thats just assuming they even consciously remember that she is there until it almost too late leaving the girl last to leave in the morning followed by her needs that may or may not have been taken care of PERIOD
