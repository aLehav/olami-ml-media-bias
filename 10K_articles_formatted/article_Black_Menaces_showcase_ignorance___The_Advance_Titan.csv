Liam Beran Staff WriterOctober  

You know them PERIOD

Theyre Brigham Young Universitys firebrands provocateurs who dare to ask questions that fly in the face of honor codes and campus administration PERIOD

Armed with cell phones open minds and the backing of  TikTok followers the Black Menaces now interrogate systems of power and discrimination at majoritywhite academic institutions throughout the country PERIOD

And Im glad that theyre doing so PERIOD

As reported by the Salt Lake Tribune the group originated after a Latterday Saints leader and professor of religion at BYU Brad Wilcox provoked controversy by suggesting that a ban on Black men joining the priesthood being lifted  in was tertiary to the whites and other races haveing to wait until  PERIOD

The nascent groups response A tongueincheek video in which a group of students jokingly agree with the lecture until Wilcox mentions the whites PERIOD

From there on the Menaces took to the walkways of BYUs Provo Utah campus with aplomb walking up to random students and asking them their opinion on issues of identity and discrimination that are often unquestioned on a campus that is  Caucasian and  Black PERIOD

The responses are infamous and the jokes that flow from them are prolific PERIOD

One such joke is Id have to see what the honor code says about that drawing inspiration from whats perceived as a copout phrase for questions like Should LGBTQ students who marry be able to get their diploma at BYU LGBTQ students can face disciplinary measures andor expulsion for being in queer relationships PERIOD

As students at UW Oshkosh these conversations should be at the forefront of our university as well PERIOD

According to our Office of Institutional Researchs Fall  Five Year Ethnicity Fact Book only  . of the  undergraduate students enrolled were students of color with . of students being marked unknown PERIOD

Phrased differently that means that nearly  of students at our campus are white PERIOD

Ive heard insensitive and inflammatory language from fellow students many of whom claim ignorance of how their statements are discriminatory PERIOD

Others among them claim that they shouldnt feel a need to censor themselves or that their racism homophobia and transphobia are jokes PERIOD

Yet for marginalized students these jokes are rarely funny PERIOD

This is why I find the Black Menaces so compelling PERIOD

Their methods of interview though nonconfrontational showcase ignorance and bigotry that is often overlooked by nonmarginalized students PERIOD

Centering the interviewees is a key component of this process by allowing a nonjudgmental space for their subjects to speak we as an audience gain a better sense of what they really think often with uncomfortable results PERIOD

From these interviews the Menaces have achieved an admirable degree of virality PERIOD

Their website now showcases merchandise a news page and scholarship opportunities they identify themselves as a coalition of students from various universities across the nation fighting to empower marginalized communities through social media. as college students we have unique opportunities to affect change and shape the course of our future PERIOD

Discussions about race sexuality and other marginalized identities have to be at the forefront of this change and our ignorance cannot be an excuse for inaction PERIOD

The Menaces utilize their platform to showcase how prevalent that ignorance can be PERIOD

And it seems like people are listening PERIOD
