Never mind how loosely the content was presented  listing stories of several family members without much clear focus  the book created a sense of warmth that has the power to make readers smile at the very end PERIOD

Born and raised in Asheville North Carolina it seems natural for Allen to set the scene in a place she knows well PERIOD This familiarity allowed her tobring the story to life especially through the careful use of details like her hand going to the collar of her white polo shirt with the Pendland Street Inn logo embroidered on the chest and the neighborhood was quiet in that way only the cold could make it freezing sounds before the snow hit the ground. all these bring something tangible engaging and amazing to readers PERIOD
