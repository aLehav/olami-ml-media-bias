Using red lights scented candles and decorative roses the Black Motivated Women turned Coffman Unions The Whole into a sensual retreat for males Tuesday night PERIOD

In the spirit of Valentines Day dolledup members of Black Motivated Women fed deserving guys a spaghetti dinner before pampering them with massages manicures facials and hair braiding as a way to show their appreciation PERIOD

The group received a  grant from the Minnesota Student Association for Mens Appreciation Night PERIOD The idea for the event played off past events hosted by male groups on campus that showed appreciation to women including the Female Appreciation Month last March PERIOD

Global studies junior Haythem Lafhaj said one event hosted by Omega Psi Phi provided women with free Mary Kay products and massages PERIOD But now the tables were turned PERIOD

Five women greeted Lafhaj as he came through the double doors asking him if he expected to get laid tonight. he realized they were joking when they placed white plastic lei around his neck PERIOD

Lafhaj took a couch seat at the dimly lit manicure station where English and prelaw firstyear student Serina Jamison trimmed his nails then laquered them with a clear polish PERIOD

At the request of Lafhaj Jamison and political science and psychology firstyear student Dionne Dillard educated him on the importance of nice clean hands PERIOD

If you have dirty finger nails we arent gonna talk to you Jamison said PERIOD

Dillard added that dirty hands and grungy finger nails are a big turnoff PERIOD

Psychology junior Amiri Brotherson and individualized studies firstyear student Timotheus Gordon said everyone deserves to be pampered every now and then PERIOD

So far Im loving it he said PERIOD

Gordon glanced around the room admiring all the beautiful ladies and said he was impressed by their kindness and hoped to return the favor PERIOD
