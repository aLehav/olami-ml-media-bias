As she fielded questions at her weekly press conference Coquese Washington didnt hesitate to talk about her teams recent struggles away from home PERIOD

 the Penn State womens basketball coach said PERIOD 

Washington and the rest of the Lady Lions  will look to match that consistency when they travel to the Cintas Center to take on Xavier at  tonight PERIOD

Consistency has been a recurring theme for Penn State so far this season PERIOD Just three games into the  season the Lady Lions are off to a  start for the second consecutive year averaging  points a game PERIOD

However while Penn State has been dominant when playing at the Bryce Jordan Center the Lady Lions have won only five games on the road over the past two seasons PERIOD

One main reason behind the Lady Lions early success this season has been their guard play PERIOD Led by junior point guard Brianne ORourke Penn States backcourt is averaging just less than  points a game and leads the Big Ten with a . 3point percentage PERIOD

 Washington said PERIOD 

And though it has been Penn States guard play that has impressed Washington so far the main pressure will stem from the Lady Lions down low who will be responsible for stopping Xaviers post play PERIOD The Musketeers  boast sophomore forward Amber Harris who was recruited as the No PERIOD  forward in the country in  PERIOD

 Washington said PERIOD 

Penn States match against Xavier will be a reunion of sorts for Washington as she will squareoff with Xavier head coach Kevin McGuff PERIOD Both Washington and McGuff worked as assistants at Notre Dame coaching together for three seasons PERIOD

 Washington said joking PERIOD
