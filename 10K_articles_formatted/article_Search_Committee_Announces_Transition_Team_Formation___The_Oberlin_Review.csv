The Presidential Search Committee created a transition team at the end of March to help ensure a smooth entry for the Colleges next president and their staff PERIOD The team is composed of  representatives from the faculty student body Board of Trustees staff and the alumni association PERIOD

Manish Mehta Chemistry professor and faculty representative for the transition team said the groups main task is to familiarize the next president with the many communities on campus PERIOD

The purpose of the committee will be to aid the new presidents transition to Oberlin Mehta wrote in an email to the Review PERIOD Broadly speaking we will help in two areas first to orient the president to the campus and various campus constituencies and second to arrange a series of introductions to those campus communities. ere was no formal application to gain a spot on the transition team PERIOD Instead the Presidential Search Committee invited any interested individuals from various Oberlin constituencies to volunteer and participate in the process PERIOD

Honorary Trustee and Transition Team Chair Liz Welch OC  described the decisionmaking process of forming the team PERIOD

The board decided we needed to pay attention to transition of the outgoing president and the incoming president to make sure it was an organized and supportive leadership transition for everybody in the community Welch said PERIOD

The current team is divided into two subcommittees one of which oversees events for the departure of outgoing President Marvin Krislov while the other is tasked with preparing for the new presidents arrival and orientation PERIOD

One task of the outgoing administration transition team has been to organize events celebrating Krislovs work at the school over the last  years PERIOD

Marvin really is connected with Oberlin students and we wanted to make sure that students knew that and that Marvin knew that students appreciated him Welch said PERIOD

The transition team has organized a series of farewell events and thank you celebrations for Krislov PERIOD These included a luncheon last week at e Hotel at Oberlin and various events with alumni PERIOD Upcoming events will include a student TGIF event and a panel discussion during Commencement weekend PERIOD

The transition team also discussed with Krislov how to best facilitate the incoming presidents arrival PERIOD

We talked to President Krislov about coming into Oberlin  years ago and things he particularly appreciated and we should continue doing said Presidential Search Committee Chair Lillie Edwards OC  PERIOD I know the committee did a great job reaching out to new college presidents and head of transition committees at other schools around the country. according to Welch there was not as much of a concrete transition plan in  when Krislov arrived PERIOD

I was on the board at the time and Im pretty sure that there wasnt as formalized a plan as were doing now she said PERIOD

As far as the next presidents arrival Welch said all groups on campus would have the chance to meet with the new president and to discuss future plans PERIOD

As soon as the president is named we will start producing what we are calling briefing binders Welch said PERIOD They literally get a briefing book that says Heres the topic for today. it might be fundraising or it might be curriculum or it might be students PERIOD  As soon as they come to campus  they will have briefing sessions with various constituents PERIOD Its to give them a flavor of the campus

and what our students care about and who those students are. college sophomore and Student Liaison on the transition team Sadie Keller stressed the importance of facetoface interaction

between the new president and students PERIOD
Ideally the new president would spend time listening to students Keller said PERIOD We dont want them sitting in an office going through paperwork PERIOD We want them in Mudd at the Conservatory at a coop getting to know students PERIOD I think thats our job as student liaisons is to try to facilitate those conversations as much as possible. the exact schedule for events the transition team is organizing largely depends on when the new president is announced PERIOD Members hoped that orientation events could begin before the end of the semester but had doubts about such an expedited timeframe PERIOD

We imagine a series of rollout meetings and introductions  during the school year either late this semester or early in the fall semester Mehta said PERIOD Given the excitement we anticipate that many groups will want time with the new president so one of the things we will have to do in the beginning is to limit that access until the president has had a chance to be oriented and settled in. edwards also used the PSCs announcement to assure the Oberlin community that the Presidential Search Committee was progressing on schedule PERIOD Though information on candidates and a timeframe cannot be verified because of confidentiality progress reports let the community know that we are indeed hard at work Edwards said PERIOD We have candidates who are the full spectrum of people who have a demonstrated track record in higher education as administrators and who are extremely well qualified and create a very exciting and competitive pool. college sophomore Cole Mantrell and College juniors Sally Slade and Jake Berstein are also part of the transition team PERIOD
