The Corsair hockey team suffered backtoback losses this past week putting their previously hot start to the season in jeopardy PERIOD

The first of two losses came against Worcester State where despite a long game of offensive backandforth the Corsairs fell at a final score of  PERIOD

The Corsairs led at the end of the first period  with goals from Dillion Radin Josh Vertentes and Kai Kapossy PERIOD The Corsairs kept pressure on the Lancer net with  shots on goal outshooting the Lancers of Worchester State who had only managed  shots on goal PERIOD UMassD only had  penalties all of which minors accounting for just  total minutes shorthanded PERIOD The Lancers dominated the circle on face offs leading the Corsairs  to  PERIOD Both teams went scoreless in 5on4 situations each going  for  on power plays PERIOD

The Corsairs second game of the week against Franklin Pierce saw the team suffering their third loss of the season at a final score of  PERIOD

In their home opener the Corsairs led  at the end of the first period with a goal late in the period from Michael Perrone PERIOD The Ravens tied things up in the second period with a goal of their own from Chris Stevenson PERIOD However the Corsairs eventually fell to the Ravens only scoring once more in the third this time from Austin Miller PERIOD While the UMassD offense struggled the Ravens notched three additional goals on top of them PERIOD

The Ravens marginally led the Corsairs in shots on goal  to  and led at the circle with  face offs won against  from the Corsairs PERIOD The Ravens only accumulated  penalties resulting in  total minutes of shorthanded play while the Corsairs accumulated  penalties spending a total of  minutes in the box PERIOD Where UMassD struggled in power play production and went  for  when at a player advantage Franklin Pierce capitalized on a Corsair spending nearly half of regulation in the penalty box scoring two power play goals in  opportunities PERIOD The Corsairs fell short to the Ravens  PERIOD

Where the Corsairs had once thrived through their seasonopeners and accrued a single overtime loss the team has now sunk back down toward . pERIOD Despite the young season whatever momentum had been carrying UMassD through triumphant blowouts and close edgingouts of competent teams has vanished within a week PERIOD

Certainly looking to bounce back the Corsairs next week of games will see them facing off against Salem State and Plymouth State on home ice PERIOD
