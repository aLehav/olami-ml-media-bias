Carter Young wrestles during his match PERIOD

John Smith is known for using the redshirt option on his newcomers more often than not PERIOD

For freshman Carter Young however that is not necessarily the case PERIOD

Young came to Oklahoma State from Stillwater High School PERIOD He was thrown into the limelight his true freshman season a rarity for members of a Smith coached squad PERIOD

Once you have the opportunity to gain experience as a true freshman Smith said PERIOD You kind of have to evaluate PERIOD For me I evaluate those true freshmen saying Is he going to learn from this season And during that season are we going to see an increase in his athletic ability and his performance on the matIm sure hes gonna have some extremely challenging matches like hes never had in his career PERIOD You just want to see him go through that. sports.edocolly.com
