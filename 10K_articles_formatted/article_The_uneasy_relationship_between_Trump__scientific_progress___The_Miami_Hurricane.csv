Historically a healthy dose of skepticism has been fundamental tosophisticated scientific thought PERIOD This skepticism demands that new hypotheses are rigorously tested before they can beaccepted PERIOD Skeptics do not deny that obtaining scientific knowledge about the universe is possible they simply require that new ideas meet certaincriteriaprior to being accepted PERIOD Unfortunately a new wave of skepticism that questions the project of science as a whole has gained political influence PERIOD

The Trump administrations attitude toward climate change showshow influential this repudiation of scientific reasoning can be PERIOD An example of this aggressive strain of skepticism can be seen anywhere from the Trump administrations decision to ban the term climate change on government websites to Trumps cabinet picks PERIOD For instance doubts surrounding human influence on climate permeated much of U.S PERIOD Secretary of StateRex Tillersons confirmation hearing PERIOD

A commonargument climate change deniers use is that prior to Copernicus scientists believed in a geocentric model of the universe PERIOD Therefore global warming could be wrong too and should not be accepted PERIOD

Although the statement is factually accurate the possibility of a theory being proved wrong exists for all scientific theories PERIOD If we are going to reject corroborated theories because they could be disproved in the future then it follows that all scientific theories should be disregarded PERIOD Science is an inductive pursuit leaving no theory safe from futurerefutation based on its logic PERIOD Seemingly benign arguments like the geocentric analogy tacitly include sentiments that doubt the process of science itself PERIOD

The philosopher David Hume once wrote A wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence. this noncontroversial conception of rationality is what eludes the Trump administration.The doctrine of the Trump administration is not one of theories failing to meet certain criteria but one that questions whether scientific discoveries themselves are credible PERIOD

Sure it is possible that climate change can become falsified in the future but the current evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is true PERIOD Consequently it is rational to accept it in the present moment PERIOD Those who believed in a geocentric model of the universe before the Copernican Revolution werent irrational butthose who continued to hold the belief after Copernicus discovery became sufficiently corroborated were PERIOD
