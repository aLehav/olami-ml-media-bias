Taylor Swift backstage at the fifty-eighth Grammy Awards on Monday Feb PERIOD  PERIOD In addition to winning album of the year Swift took home the awards for best music video and best pop vocal album PERIOD

Monday nights Grammy Awards went as expected PERIOD There were many performances few awards actually presented on TV and more than enough awkward moments to go around PERIOD I watched excitedly waiting for my favorite award of the night album of the year PERIOD

As Id hoped Taylor Swift walked away with the award for her platinumselling album . as she accepted her award she took a notsosubtle hit at rapper Kanye West who features a song on his new album that claims that hes the one who made Swift famous in the first place PERIOD

After reminding us that shes the first woman to win album of the year twice she told all the young women out there  there are going to be people along the way who will to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame PERIOD But if you just focus on the work and you dont let those people sidetrack you someday when you get where youre going youll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there PERIOD And that will be the greatest feeling in the world. i couldnt be happier with the way she addressed Wests misogynistic lyrics PERIOD She was classy tasteful and just sassy enough to remind him who hes messing with PERIOD However when I got on Twitter after the awards I was disheartened to see how people were reacting to Swifts award and speech itself PERIOD

One tweeter wrote F Taylor Swift PERIOD F you if you like Taylor Swift PERIOD F the Grammys PERIOD Give Kendrick Lamar what he deserves PERIOD Im out. another tweeted that theyre not sure how Kendrick Lamars album loses to Taylor Swift for album of the year when one is pure art and the other is literal trash 

On top of that many people didnt seem to find Swifts acceptance speech as great and empowering as I did PERIOD One of the first tweets that I saw pop up on my timeline after the show was You are not an activist Taylor PERIOD Stop it PERIOD This is gross PERIOD I have hives. if you ask me Swift took a genuinely unfortunate situation and handled it in such a way that showcases just how great she really is PERIOD OK maybe  was produced by men instead of women PERIOD But why are we letting that take away from what shes done to empower herself and other women

Instead of cowering down to West when he told her that she didnt deserve to win best female video at the  Video Music Awards she let him make a fool of himself and later forgave him PERIOD Instead of turning to social media or talking trash about West after he rapped about Me and Taylor might still have sex PERIOD Why I made that b famous she rose above and tried to use that platform as an excuse to reach out to other young women who might feel that their success is being taken away from them and encouraging them to remember that it was them and no one else who got them where they are PERIOD

Sure shes not perfect PERIOD But I think anyone whos willing to get up in front of that many people and use their time to stand up for something thats not OK or try to help someone who may be going through something similar deserves some credit PERIOD

I think people are way too hard on Swift PERIOD If you dont like her music fine PERIOD If you hate her new haircut whatever PERIOD But stop tearing her down on social media platforms simply because you think you can PERIOD Because every time you do it just proves why its so important that she does things like she did with her speech on Monday PERIOD
