7679,1970-01-01,"this was the way Bev Smith envisioned her young team playing PERIOD

Her post players crashed the boards and finished on the offensive end PERIOD The guards took care of the basketball and efficiently ran Oregons offense PERIOD The game was close but instead of crumbling a young roster answered with poise PERIOD

The resulting  Oregon win Saturday against Oregon State inside McArthur Court gave a clear indication of the progress the Ducks have made this season PERIOD

The win in front of  fans sent senior guard Kaela Chapdelaine out in a positive fashion following an emotional pregame ceremony for the Canadian who hails from the small town of Okotoks Alberta PERIOD

Family friends and former Oregon teammates awaited Chapdelaine on the court PERIOD She emerged and hugged current teammates coaches and her supporters PERIOD

Typically poised Chapdelaine let her guard down until the pregame ceremony had passed and she refocused on winning her last game in an Oregon uniform PERIOD

My teammates know thats all I care about Chapdelaine said PERIOD When all is said and done I just want to win the game. oregon has now won three of its last four games and enters the Pacific10 Conference Tournament this week in San Jose Calif PERIOD With Washingtons win over California today Oregon finishes in seventh place in the Pac10 PERIOD The Ducks first game in the tournament will be against 10thplace Washington State on Friday at  p.m PERIOD

By beating the Beavers Oregon improved its record  overall and  in the Pac10 PERIOD Oregon State fell to  and  in the Pac10 PERIOD

Winning the conference tournament and earning a spot in the NCAA Tournament is Oregons only chance now at postseason play PERIOD

The Pac10 Tournament  thats an automatic bid point guard Tamika Nurse said PERIOD Thats all we can hope for right now. forward Ellie Manou showed the consistency coaches had been looking for with  points and six rebounds following up a 12point eightrebound performance against UCLA PERIOD

Chapdelaine who had eight assists often found Manou cutting to the hoop where the 6foot3 post finished PERIOD Manou has struggled much of this season consistently making shots inside but finished strong Saturday with a 9of14 shooting performance PERIOD

The potential of Manou and center Nicole Canepa had been touted much of this season and are now achieving it as the season ends PERIOD

Until you realize it yourself and start believing in yourself thats when it really starts to show with the success Chapdelaine said PERIOD This year its been about reinforcing how great they are PERIOD They do have talent. canepa had a quieter afternoon with six points and three rebounds PERIOD

Oregons post play made up for another offgame by guard Taylor Lilley who made three of her  shots one week removed from shooting 4of17 against UCLA PERIOD

Manou has dealt with foot pain throughout the season which has prevented her from practicing PERIOD The adrenaline she says takes away the pain during the game PERIOD Its the next day she feels it PERIOD

I just tried to play hard Manou said PERIOD For me its not about scoring PERIOD Its about rebounds PERIOD Its about hustle PERIOD Scoring is the bonus. the overall effect of Oregons recent success has buoyed the spirits of a team down on itself following a sevengame losing streak that ended with the Ducks win at Washington State PERIOD

Oregons upswing has also coincided with the Ducks more relaxed approach when faced with a close game in the waning minutes PERIOD Oregon State pulled within three  with  remaining but Oregon reeled off the next seven points to make it a 10point game  with  seconds left PERIOD

The locker room is so much more positive and we feel better on the floor Nurse said PERIOD

Oregon States Brittney Davis missed much of the latter half of Pac10 play with a knee injury and wasnt expected to play Saturday but had a 20minute stint and had four points and three assists PERIOD

Alex Mitchell had  points and  rebounds PERIOD Forward Tiffany Ducker who provided a consistent scoring presence with a variety of backtothebasket moves led Oregon State with  points PERIOD
