1750,2023-10-30,"on Tuesday September 29women of color were recognized for getting involved in politics PERIOD These were simply women who were involved in their childs school or just involved in their own community who gain the support of their peers to run for office and to take a seat in office PERIOD The University of Massachusetts Boston Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy played a part in helping put together and publishing Profiles in Leadership Women of Color Elected to Office in Massachusetts PERIOD Women of color only make up two percent of the state legislature five percent in the senate and one percent in the House of Representatives PERIOD This publication marks the second collaboration for the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy celebrating its twentieth Womens Pipeline for Change also celebrating seven years on the scene PERIOD
This is what her story in the making looks like PERIOD I would like to thank the women in the guide for being trailblazers said Ann Bookman Director We value it deeply and hope it will continue for years PERIOD
This guide has two themes one being a narrative of exclusion and join under representation and the second narrative of accomplishment dedicated to public service and personal sacrifice PERIOD All the women featured in this guide fought against all of the odds against them PERIOD They had the courage to walk up to people and crowds and get them to donate to their campaign PERIOD With that encouragement and the community support those women ran for office and took a seat PERIOD
My main message is to teach and encourage others. the first Asian American women to have a seat in council in Plainfield Keiko Orrall said Kick the door open and hold it open for someone else PERIOD
In the audience were so many women of all colors and races that are part of the government in one or form another PERIOD As well as young women who aspire to one day run and win a place in office PERIOD All throughtout the event women were passing on encouragement to one another pushing those young minds to keep their goals of becoming the next council woman as well as telling the young women real life obstacles that they had to overcome PERIOD The Profiles in Leadership Women of Color Elected to Office in Massachusetts book is not soley for women of color but for everyone to push them to get involved in the government and speak up for the people who do not have a voice PERIOD
