New research by Dr PERIOD Andrew Halley and the Krubitzer Lab at UC Davis details how bat brains are highly specialized for echolocation and flight

By MARGO ROSENBAUM sciencetheaggie.org

People often wonder how the mammals we see swinging through trees swimming in the ocean or flying over our heads relate to us PERIOD We ponder how millions of years of evolution resulted in so many mammals of varying intelligence and abilities PERIOD

If only we could look right into their brains PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Andrew Halley a postdoctoral researcher in the Krubitzer Lab at UC Davis did just that PERIOD With the help of fellow researchers at UC Davis Simon Fraser University and UC Berkeley Halley performed brain surgeries on anesthetized bats to better understand the motor cortex  the region of the brain controlling voluntary movement across the body PERIOD

Publishing the results on May  in the journal Current Biology Halley and the other researchers discovered that bats brains are highly specialized for two unique aspects of their biology echolocation and selfpropelled flight PERIOD

To make this discovery Halley the lead author of the paper and his colleagues mapped the brain regions controlling movements in these fruit bats focusing on areas dedicated to echolocation and flight PERIOD

Bats represent a quarter of all living mammalian species but until only recently much of their brains and evolution remained a mystery PERIOD Halley and his fellow researchers sought to change that PERIOD

Before this study a bat species full motor cortex had never been mapped PERIOD This achievement now allows researchers to understand the part of the brain involved in the planning control and execution of voluntary movements PERIOD

Paths to studying evolution

Fascinated by evolutionary questions Halley studies evolutionary neurobiology and comparative neuroscience PERIOD Originally from Philadelphia he majored in psychology and worked in a genetics laboratory as an undergraduate at Pennsylvania State University PERIOD Halley said he grew up more interested in the humanities but always held a fascination for psychology PERIOD

Biology piqued his interest when he started taking biology classes in college especially after learning about evolutionary theory PERIOD With the questions he started asking he realized he needed to learn more about neuroscience to answer them and wanted to study brain evolution PERIOD

Halley completed his Ph.D PERIOD at UC Berkeley in  after studying biological anthropology and working on a project tangentially related to neuroscience in which he studied differences in embryonic development across species PERIOD

This fascination for evolution and neuroscience brought him to the Krubitzer Lab at the UC Davis Center for Neuroscience as a postdoctoral researcher PERIOD

The Krubitzer Lab was sort of a natural fit Dr PERIOD Krubitzer is one of the preeminent brain evolution researchers thats around Halley said PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Mackenzie Englund a former graduate student in the lab and coauthor of the paper shares Halleys appreciation for evolution and sensory systems which he said are this medium through which we interact with the world. englund came to UC Davis for his Ph.D PERIOD to research similar questions PERIOD

Evolution was always just one of those things that made me feel really close to the world Englund said PERIOD

Straying from the study of traditional model organisms

Led by Dr PERIOD Leah Krubitzer the lab largely focuses on studying the evolution of the neocortex which is the part of the brain that most people think of when they think of a brain according to Halley PERIOD The lab is interested in multiple aspects of the neocortex its function interconnectivity within the structure and how it links to other parts of the brain PERIOD

By studying a range of mammals the labs researchers seek to understand how evolution results in varied brain organization across species PERIOD Halley said the lab takes a comparative approach and studies animals that stray from traditional model organisms such as mice and zebrafish PERIOD

The lab strives to understand whether parts of the brain have evolved to correspond to uniqueness in the bodies of mammals like opossums platypi primates tree shrews and most recently  with the help of Halley  bats PERIOD

You can learn a lot of things just by looking at extreme adaptations that you find in the natural world Halley said PERIOD Comparative research on the one hand is just inherently interesting because were interested in understanding how evolution works and specifically how brain evolution works. according to Halley its important to study animals other than just model organisms since studying only these animals tells researchers little about evolutions role in altering brains across many different species PERIOD

Theres a handful of biological models that are generally used to do sort of bread and butter neuroscience and theyre also really widely used for translational research for trying to develop medicines Halley said PERIOD There are limits to the degree to which a laboratory mouse is a good model for a human. brain surgery on bats

Halleys recent work is part of a larger project in the Krubitzer Lab to illustrate how regions of species brains are organized according to differences in their bodies and behaviors PERIOD

This study focused on understanding the motor cortex in bats its variation what it represents and whether flight and echolocation have resulted in unique morphologies such as the extra elongated fingers of bats with membranes connecting the digits forelimbs and hind limbs to form their giant wings PERIOD

It varies from individual to individual  motor cortex is so much more variable than other sensory areas because the cortex may be built by things that we do our behaviors Englund said PERIOD

All mammals have a motor cortex so understanding this important part of the brain in bats could hint at understanding brain function and evolution in humans PERIOD

Whats really important is figuring out the common themes of the motor cortex across all species and what things can vary Englund said PERIOD

Using bats from a breeding colony at UC Berkeley Halley Englund and the other researchers performed brain surgery to study their questions PERIOD

After anesthetizing the bat under study Halley and the scientists opened up the bats skull exposed the neocortex and used electrodes to stimulate different areas of the motor cortex PERIOD By applying small bits of current they sought to determine which muscle and limb movements were created by stimulating various parts of the motor cortex PERIOD

Applying small bits of current to different parts of the brain was essentially an artificial way of mimicking what happened in a naturallybehaving bat Halley said

Halley and Englund worked together and took turns in the experiments which often resulted in work days lasting from  to  hours PERIOD Because every animals life is so precious they wanted to get the most data they could out of each experiment Englund said PERIOD

Wed be switching off in the experiment room giving each other breaks so we could go slam some coffee and maybe a granola bar Englund said PERIOD

In the end their novel findings were worth the grueling days PERIOD

The researchers notably discovered that in Egyptian fruit bats large regions of the motor cortex are devoted to their tongue which makes sounds for echolocation and to the muscles propelling their limbs for flight PERIOD

Mapping a motor cortex

After the experiments the researchers could create a map of the spatiallysegregated areas of the brain that regulate body movements PERIOD The map is topographic compared to the body meaning certain parts of the body are larger or smaller depending on the species PERIOD Larger areas on the map mean that part of the body is overrepresented in the brain Halley said PERIOD

The central findings of our study were that  different parts of the brain are enlarged in different species based on their behaviors or their body types Halley said PERIOD

Areas of emphasis in the motor cortex can likely be explained by their unique biology and adaptations PERIOD Egyptian fruit bats have unusual methods of echolocation  instead of using their larynx like most bats these animals use their tongue PERIOD In the study over  of the stimulated sensory and motor cortex controlled tongue movements PERIOD Additionally the vast majority of the motor cortex was responsible for coordinated shoulder and hindlimb movements explaining a possible reason for the special morphology of bat wings PERIOD

Despite all the work of Halley Englund and others at the Krubitzer Lab more study is necessary to understand the full scope of the motor cortex and other parts of the brain in bats PERIOD

These animals are becoming more common as model species of study but still many of their neurobiology basics remain poorly understood PERIOD Creating and maintaining colonies is complex and their unique body morphology makes it more difficult to use them in neuroscience research Halley said PERIOD

Future evolutionary neurology research could involve more study of bats based on Halleys findings Mapping the motor cortex is just step one PERIOD
