No PERIOD  Georgia lost to South Carolina  on Saturday in Sanford Stadium partly due to Jake Fromms lackluster performance PERIOD Here are the details from Jake Fromms first turnover of the year

The Bulldogs and Gamecocks were tied at  with a little over a minute left before halftime PERIOD South Carolinas Parker White had just made a 49yard field goal to tie it up PERIOD

At this point Georgia fans had no reason to believe the Bulldogs were going to actually lose the game PERIOD Just last week on Oct PERIOD  Georgia trailed  early in the second quarter before it came back and won by  at Neyland Stadium PERIOD On Saturday Georgia didnt look good PERIOD But things were finally looking up PERIOD The Bulldogs had a secondand4 from its 47yard line PERIOD

Fromm lined up in the shotgun with running back DAndre Swift to his right PERIOD The Bulldogs had four pass catchers lined up two to the right and two to the left PERIOD Before the snap South Carolinas Javon Kinlaw was lined up across from right guard Cade Mays PERIOD At the snap Kinlaw switched spots and rushed against right tackle Isaiah Wilson and successfully pressured Fromm PERIOD Swift was no longer in the backfield to help with blocking PERIOD Fromm quickly heaved the ball to the right sideline where Israel Mukuamu jumped the pass and returned it for a touchdown PERIOD

There was a really big guy in my face I tried to throw it out of bounds PERIOD I knew that George was in the area and I was trying to get it over his head Fromm said about the pick six PERIOD I dont know what happened I was on the ground after that. jake Fromm was outplayed by South Carolinas defense in all but one quarter PERIOD The Gamecocks did not allow any touchdown passes from the junior quarterback after three quarters PERIOD
