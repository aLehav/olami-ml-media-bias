Release Date Feb PERIOD 

Googling Los AngelesStockholmbased band Grizfolk confirms the bands folk and countrytinged bluegrass roots turning up the groups mascot of sorts a bearded and shotgunwielding man in a cowboy hat and  3D glasses Grizfolks kooky twist on the expected sets up From the Spark nicely as an EP Grizfolk plays a laserinfected brand of indie rock one that struts to its own rhythm looking at traditional hooks through new lenses PERIOD

Opener Hymnals sets the stage with echoing piano and skittering drums settling lightly over a stomping dance beat before soaring away at the chorus PERIOD An electronic pulse runs warmly through the four tracks and Grizfolk forgoes a modern pop pitfall by keeping this side of the equation tastefully subtle letting it expand to the foreground without obscuring any instrumental roots PERIOD At times this concept melds deliciously as in the shuffling sway of The Struggle  guitar and keys interlock and overlap in an organic swell while vocalist Adam Roth resonates He turns around and sees the world he knows fall apart  The struggle you are up against makes you what you are. other times though it bloats into stereotype PERIOD Vagabond feels unique enough to start with soft drips of percussion and wandering piano but it opens up into a chorus too lazily anthemic to sit comfortably among its three fellow tracks PERIOD Thankfully a highlight waits just around the corner Wait for You tastes the most of the bands country roots and is all the better for the dancing flare and harmonized croon that brings the EP to a close PERIOD

As From the Spark is Grizfolks proper debut the slight dips into cliche can be forgiven PERIOD What keeps the band on repeat is the enthusiasm it bring to its infusion of dance and folk and its undeniable knack for crafting infectious songs from it PERIOD For a foursong EP From the Spark makes its mark PERIOD
