3736,2018-10-24,"in a season full of nearwins but marked by a lack of results Tuesday nights ranked matchup with Rhode Islanda team recently ranked as high as No PERIOD  in the countrywas a chance for Boston College mens soccer to finish its nonconference schedule with a winning record PERIOD

The Eagles have proved throughout the season that they can compete with pretty much anyone in the countrythe thriller against No PERIOD  Wake Forest was evidence of thatbut they havent been able to seal the deal and secure a quality win PERIOD Given another opportunity to earn a resumeboosting win against one of the best teams in the Atlantic  BC once again fell short falling  and saw its losing streak stretch to four games PERIOD

Eagles   Atlantic Coast head coach Ed Kelly decided to shake things up with its starting lineup against the Rams   Atlantic  PERIOD Simon Enstrom was noticeably missing from the starting lineup as was Trevor Davock and Kristoffer Konradsson while Christian Garner started in goalfor his first appearance of the seasoninstead of AntonioChavez Borrelli PERIOD

The first half between BC and URI proved to be a rather sloppy slow affair PERIOD The Eagles strayed offside and committed a pair of fouls within the first six minutes of the game while the Rams were notably physical as well PERIOD Shots were hard to come by but the pace picked up slightly near the end of the half PERIOD BC and URI totaled three corners each but both teams recorded just three shots while combining for  fouls PERIOD

At the beginning of the second half Kellys lineup decision became clearer PERIOD Davock and Enstrom with a half of rest were unleashed in the second half but ChavezBorrelli and Konradsson notably still remained absent for the entirety of the game PERIOD

The back half of play yielded much more action than the front PERIOD In the fifty-second minute URI senior Chae Brangman slipped a pass through the Eagles defense to fellow senior Dominik Richter who successfully converted the breakaway goal for his eighth of the season a mark good for third in the A10 PERIOD

BC was not willing to go down without a fight though and it responded almost immediately PERIOD A mere four minutes later Enstrom beat Rams goalkeeper Roger Penske at the right post notching his ninth goal of the season PERIOD Kellys decision not to start Enstrom seemed striking especially when one considers the seniors impressive nonconference success but it was a choice that paid off when the wellrested forward netted the equalizer PERIOD

For the next  minutes BC and URI each had opportunities to score but neither team was able to successfully convert PERIOD With only  minutes left to play the game entered into a lightning delay for about  minutes quickly bringing a backandforth matchup to a drawnout standstill PERIOD After play eventually resumed the freshlegged Eagles and Rams each launched a bevy of shots but Garner and Penske each stood strong in goal PERIOD

Unfortunately for BC the final  minutes were once again its Achilles heel PERIOD The Eagles have lost games to No PERIOD  Louisville No PERIOD  North Carolina and the Demon Deacons in which they were tied entering the final  minutes of play but conceded late PERIOD That struggle repeated itself on Tuesday night in Kingston R.I PERIOD In the eightieth minute URIs Tyler Dicksen put a free kick into the box where Peder Kristiansen played it to Brangman whose shot found the back of the net putting the Rams up for good PERIOD

The Eagles didnt give up letting off four shots and attempting two corners PERIOD But none of these chances resulted in a conversion and thus once again BC let a match slip away in the final stages of regulation PERIOD

To say that this loss is discouraging for Eagles fans is an understatement PERIOD No matter how hard Kellys team fights it is seemingly unable to finish PERIOD Granted BC is amid a brutal stretch of the schedule but it has still failed to pick up any big winsaside from its upset of North Carolina Statedespite being competitive PERIOD Its certainly demoralizing for this team as even a drastic lineup change that seemed like it would spark a muchneeded victory wasnt enough PERIOD Every game but one on the season has decided by one goal or lesswhich means that BC has the talent and the fight of a great program but possess the record of a mediocre team PERIOD

The outlook for the Eagles doesnt look great PERIOD With seven losses and another ranked opponent to face on Friday in No PERIOD  Syracuse for the regular season finale the Eagles will likely enter in the ACC Tournament as a low seed PERIOD The game against the Orange could carry tremendous significance for the postseason seedingcurrently BC holds a onepoint edge for the tenth seed PERIOD That one point is the difference between playing Notre Dame a team the Eagles narrowly lost by a goal to earlier in the season and playing Virginia Tech an unfamiliar opponent PERIOD

On a broader scope a win or draw with Syracusepaired with a loss by Pittsburgh to No PERIOD  Notre Damewould likely bump BC up to the ninth seed in the bracket barring other results PERIOD The nineseed takes on the eightseed which is currently N.C PERIOD State a team the Eagles slipped by at home back on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The next game on the schedule for BC will directly affect the makeup of the conference tournamenta singlegame elimination bracket that will mark the end of the Eagles season if they dont flip the script and make a postseason run PERIOD
