I honestly didnt know that they were increasing but Im not surprised if it is because it seems like the people leading this country are not on the same page as actual scientists doctors and healthcare providers PERIOD You have one side saying put your mask on stay 6feet apart try to avoid spreading COVID as much as you can and on the other hand you have people in power that make you think that there is no virus no COVID PERIOD I think that creates doubt into one or the other and so people are living their lives as if there was no virus PERIOD So Im honestly not surprised but at the same time living in that climate Im kinda scared because that puts uncertainty in my own life because Im like okay is there really a pandemic And if there is how long are we going to be like this if there are no efforts done to slow it down or stop it Because if people continue to live their lives like they used to then well always be stuck in this bubble where we wont be able to get out and live our own lives. langley Black sheherhers

Honestly its scary but whats new It was to be expected PERIOD Numbers give me anxiety and knowing the exact counts of it and knowing I live in a house with five individuals including myself all living different lives is really scary to think about because theyre definitely coming into contact with COVID no doubt PERIOD My really good friend told me its like driving PERIOD You can be as safe and do the best things for yourself as you can in this no matter what there are going to be other people PERIOD So watching the cases is scary and knowing theyre increasing no matter what throughout the United States PERIOD I know its happening so Im going to continue doing what Im doing and probably see less of my normal group PERIOD Theres a lot of unknown variables right now and so increasing cases are just like weve known we live in the United States and we havent been handling this pandemic properly. isis Lowery sheherhers

I think its frustrating for sure but all I can do is make sure Im practicing social distancing and wearing my mask PERIOD I think a lot of young people think they are immune but often forget many residents of Corvallis are at risk and we all have to be mindful and respectful of that. marisol De La Torre sheherhers
Fourthyear sociology student with an option in crime and justice
Im very concerned about COVID19 cases increasing on campus especially knowing that the reported numbers underestimate the total number of positive cases for OSUs Corvallis campus and surrounding area PERIOD I am very privileged that I can work and learn remotely currently but obviously not everyone can do so PERIOD I wish testing was more accessible for everyone and that people were able to get tested often PERIOD That is the only way that I would feel that the university was being responsible in their response to the COVID19 global pandemic. ray Wolf hehimhis
Secondyear liberal arts major with a social justice minor
I wish I could say Im surprised with COVID19 management on campus but the truth is that I wasnt expecting a different outcome PERIOD If health protocols arent enforced and strictly followed by the entire community COVID is going to keep spreading especially when folks keep getting together in large settings without masks PERIOD I feel like its particularly tricky on a university campus since a global pandemic wasnt on anyones college bucket list and grieving that loss is normal but selfishness has its limits and students need to start taking action to protect the community  themselves. grace Deitzler shethey
Thirdyear Ph.D PERIOD student in the Department of Microbiology
I am grateful for the hard work and efforts of the TRACE study team for the compassion and thoughtfulness of the students faculty and staff who are taking this seriously and for the swift action of the university against students who have failed to adhere to guidelines PERIOD However as a graduate student and a microbiologist who has been closely following guidelines since the start of the pandemic I am disheartened and disappointed in the selfish actions of students and other community members who have continued to throw caution to the wind and host large parties gatherings and events that pretend as if there is no threat of a pandemic especially as cases are on the rise PERIOD On Halloween as I drove to the mouse facility on campus to complete essential lab work I passed several large and blatant house parties near campus with groups of who I can only presume were college students spilling out onto the lawns and streets to celebrate Halloween very few with masks PERIOD This is incredibly selfish and frankly disgusting PERIOD We all have a choice to protect our community and I truly believe that most Beavers want to do the right thing PERIOD But as we continue into the cold and rainy season and approach more holidays I just hope that more members of our campus community will choose to take public health seriously and stay home and we see the recent rise in cases start to flatten out. lacey Prososki sheherhers

I am so grateful for TRACE its a great resource for students and faculty to sign up to be tested for COVID.I live off campus but still in Corvallis and I work on campus and sometimes I feel out of the loop regarding the number of cases on campus I see most people wearing masks and keeping a distance when I work in the MU PERIOD But I also see on social media people partying especially Halloweekend in large groups on the weekends PERIOD The stigma around COVID is a concern too because I am not sure that people are reporting who all they have been in contact with and where they have been. noah Denker hehimhis
Fifthyear graphic design student
Its simply terrifying PERIOD I was relieved when classes remained remote but shocked to see the number of students who moved to campus due to OSUs late announcement of not requiring students to move on campus PERIOD The social distancing mandatory masks and hand sanitizers around simply arent enough when were letting in so many people from all over PERIOD Students are immediately being put at risk to keep funding up PERIOD Parties are still going on at Frats and apartments near campus and many people are eating in at restaurants this town is not big and there are only so many grocery stores that see hundreds upon hundreds of people a day PERIOD This is a small concentrated area that could be doing a lot worse but should also have done better. leah Rietema sheherhers

Its simply terrifying PERIOD I was relieved when classes remained remote but shocked to see the number of students who moved to campus due to OSUs late announcement of not requiring students to move on campus PERIOD The social distancing mandatory masks and hand sanitizers around simply arent enough when were letting in so many people from all over PERIOD Students are immediately being put at risk to keep funding up PERIOD Parties are still going on at Frats and apartments near campus and many people are eating in at restaurants this town is not big and there are only so many grocery stores that see hundreds upon hundreds of people a day PERIOD This is a small concentrated area that could be doing a lot worse but should also have done better. shoroq Alabdali sheherhers

I wish I could say Im surprised with COVID19 management on campus but the truth is that I wasnt expecting a different outcome PERIOD If health protocols arent enforced and strictly followed by the entire community COVID is going to keep spreading especially when folks keep getting together in large settings without masks PERIOD I feel like its particularly tricky on a university campus since a global pandemic wasnt on anyones college bucket list and grieving that loss is normal but selfishness has its limits and students need to start taking action to protect the community  themselves. grace Deitzler shethey

I am grateful for the hard work and efforts of the TRACE study team for the compassion and thoughtfulness of the students faculty and staff who are taking this seriously and for the swift action of the university against students who have failed to adhere to guidelines PERIOD However as a graduate student and a microbiologist who has been closely following guidelines since the start of the pandemic I am disheartened and disappointed in the selfish actions of students and other community members who have continued to throw caution to the wind and host large parties gatherings and events that pretend as if there is no threat of a pandemic especially as cases are on the rise PERIOD On Halloween as I drove to the mouse facility on campus to complete essential lab work I passed several large and blatant house parties near campus with groups of who I can only presume were college students spilling out onto the lawns and streets to celebrate Halloween very few with masks PERIOD This is incredibly selfish and frankly disgusting PERIOD We all have a choice to protect our community and I truly believe that most Beavers want to do the right thing PERIOD But as we continue into the cold and rainy season and approach more holidays I just hope that more members of our campus community will choose to take public health seriously and stay home and we see the recent rise in cases start to flatten out. lacey Prososki sheherhers

I am so grateful for TRACE its a great resource for students and faculty to sign up to be tested for COVID.I live off campus but still in Corvallis and I work on campus and sometimes I feel out of the loop regarding the number of cases on campus I see most people wearing masks and keeping a distance when I work in the MU PERIOD But I also see on social media people partying especially Halloweekend in large groups on the weekends PERIOD The stigma around COVID is a concern too because I am not sure that people are reporting who all they have been in contact with and where they have been. noah Denker hehimhis
Fifthyear graphic design student
Its simply terrifying PERIOD I was relieved when classes remained remote but shocked to see the number of students who moved to campus due to OSUs late announcement of not requiring students to move on campus PERIOD The social distancing mandatory masks and hand sanitizers around simply arent enough when were letting in so many people from all over PERIOD Students are immediately being put at risk to keep funding up PERIOD Parties are still going on at Frats and apartments near campus and many people are eating in at restaurants this town is not big and there are only so many grocery stores that see hundreds upon hundreds of people a day PERIOD This is a small concentrated area that could be doing a lot worse but should also have done better. i honestly didnt know that they were increasing but Im not surprised if it is because it seems like the people leading this country are not on the same page as actual scientists doctors and healthcare providers PERIOD You have one side saying put your mask on stay 6feet apart try to avoid spreading COVID as much as you can and on the other hand you have people in power that make you think that there is no virus no COVID PERIOD I think that creates doubt into one or the other and so people are living their lives as if there was no virus PERIOD So Im honestly not surprised but at the same time living in that climate Im kinda scared because that puts uncertainty in my own life because Im like okay is there really a pandemic And if there is how long are we going to be like this if there are no efforts done to slow it down or stop it Because if people continue to live their lives like they used to then well always be stuck in this bubble where we wont be able to get out and live our own lives. langley Black sheherhers

Honestly its scary but whats new It was to be expected PERIOD Numbers give me anxiety and knowing the exact counts of it and knowing I live in a house with five individuals including myself all living different lives is really scary to think about because theyre definitely coming into contact with COVID no doubt PERIOD My really good friend told me its like driving PERIOD You can be as safe and do the best things for yourself as you can in this no matter what there are going to be other people PERIOD So watching the cases is scary and knowing theyre increasing no matter what throughout the United States PERIOD I know its happening so Im going to continue doing what Im doing and probably see less of my normal group PERIOD Theres a lot of unknown variables right now and so increasing cases are just like weve known we live in the United States and we havent been handling this pandemic properly. isis Lowery sheherhers

I think its frustrating for sure but all I can do is make sure Im practicing social distancing and wearing my mask PERIOD I think a lot of young people think they are immune but often forget many residents of Corvallis are at risk and we all have to be mindful and respectful of that. marisol De La Torre sheherhers
Fourthyear sociology student with an option in crime and justice
Im very concerned about COVID19 cases increasing on campus especially knowing that the reported numbers underestimate the total number of positive cases for OSUs Corvallis campus and surrounding area PERIOD I am very privileged that I can work and learn remotely currently but obviously not everyone can do so PERIOD I wish testing was more accessible for everyone and that people were able to get tested often PERIOD That is the only way that I would feel that the university was being responsible in their response to the COVID19 global pandemic. ray Wolf hehimhis
Secondyear liberal arts major with a social justice minor
I wish I could say Im surprised with COVID19 management on campus but the truth is that I wasnt expecting a different outcome PERIOD If health protocols arent enforced and strictly followed by the entire community COVID is going to keep spreading especially when folks keep getting together in large settings without masks PERIOD I feel like its particularly tricky on a university campus since a global pandemic wasnt on anyones college bucket list and grieving that loss is normal but selfishness has its limits and students need to start taking action to protect the community  themselves. grace Deitzler shethey
Thirdyear Ph.D PERIOD student in the Department of Microbiology
I am grateful for the hard work and efforts of the TRACE study team for the compassion and thoughtfulness of the students faculty and staff who are taking this seriously and for the swift action of the university against students who have failed to adhere to guidelines PERIOD However as a graduate student and a microbiologist who has been closely following guidelines since the start of the pandemic I am disheartened and disappointed in the selfish actions of students and other community members who have continued to throw caution to the wind and host large parties gatherings and events that pretend as if there is no threat of a pandemic especially as cases are on the rise PERIOD On Halloween as I drove to the mouse facility on campus to complete essential lab work I passed several large and blatant house parties near campus with groups of who I can only presume were college students spilling out onto the lawns and streets to celebrate Halloween very few with masks PERIOD This is incredibly selfish and frankly disgusting PERIOD We all have a choice to protect our community and I truly believe that most Beavers want to do the right thing PERIOD But as we continue into the cold and rainy season and approach more holidays I just hope that more members of our campus community will choose to take public health seriously and stay home and we see the recent rise in cases start to flatten out. lacey Prososki sheherhers

I am so grateful for TRACE its a great resource for students and faculty to sign up to be tested for COVID.I live off campus but still in Corvallis and I work on campus and sometimes I feel out of the loop regarding the number of cases on campus I see most people wearing masks and keeping a distance when I work in the MU PERIOD But I also see on social media people partying especially Halloweekend in large groups on the weekends PERIOD The stigma around COVID is a concern too because I am not sure that people are reporting who all they have been in contact with and where they have been. noah Denker hehimhis

I am so grateful for TRACE its a great resource for students and faculty to sign up to be tested for COVID.I live off campus but still in Corvallis and I work on campus and sometimes I feel out of the loop regarding the number of cases on campus I see most people wearing masks and keeping a distance when I work in the MU PERIOD But I also see on social media people partying especially Halloweekend in large groups on the weekends PERIOD The stigma around COVID is a concern too because I am not sure that people are reporting who all they have been in contact with and where they have been. noah Denker hehimhis

Its simply terrifying PERIOD I was relieved when classes remained remote but shocked to see the number of students who moved to campus due to OSUs late announcement of not requiring students to move on campus PERIOD The social distancing mandatory masks and hand sanitizers around simply arent enough when were letting in so many people from all over PERIOD Students are immediately being put at risk to keep funding up PERIOD Parties are still going on at Frats and apartments near campus and many people are eating in at restaurants this town is not big and there are only so many grocery stores that see hundreds upon hundreds of people a day PERIOD This is a small concentrated area that could be doing a lot worse but should also have done better. grace Deitzler shethey
