9746,2022-02-25,"recently I learned that most universities in Europe provide daycare for students and faculty members which allows them to attend class or work stressfree PERIOD Not only would this be helpful with scheduling matters but it would also allow students and faculty to not worry about paying an exorbitant price for external childcare PERIOD While CSU used to host a daycare center it closed in  PERIOD However oncampus daycare is a benefit worth having for students and faculty PERIOD

According to Higher Ed Magazine the benefits of oncampus daycare are plentiful PERIOD First oncampus child care can reduce employee absenteeism and tardiness by cutting out dropoff pickup and outoftheway commutes increase productivity engagement and morale among employees and encourage employees to return to work sooner after the birth of a child. employees and students would be happier knowing their children were close as well as making their commutes much easier PERIOD It can promote worklife balance allow employees and students to check on their children throughout the day and allow breastfeeding mothers access to their children and increase retention of students with children and increase ontime graduation rates. not only would oncampus childcare benefit employees and students but the university would be eligible for state and federal tax credits as well PERIOD

Considering that oncampus childcare would benefit employees students and the university itself it seems like an easy decision that CSU should reimplement its daycare service PERIOD The childcare center which was partnered with the YMCA closed in  due to low enrollment PERIOD

However things may be different now as childcare costs have skyrocketed in recent years PERIOD In fact Fox8 claimed that child care costs almost as much as college tuition in  PERIOD Along with that students who are earning early childcare or child education degrees could complete internships through this center and provide care at a very low cost PERIOD Overall an oncampus childcare center would benefit the university in a major way PERIOD

I am an English and Political Science major at CSU in my third year at the university PERIOD I love writing for the Cauldron and Im so excited to bring student opinions to the forefront of university news
