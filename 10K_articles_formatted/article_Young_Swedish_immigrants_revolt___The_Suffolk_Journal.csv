362,2016-06-08,"a bad economy and the idea of prosperity are incompatible. many people over the recent history of mankind have traveled from various parts of the globe to the West expecting all of their dreams to come true PERIOD Some achieved these dreams and some wonder Did I make a wrong decision in leaving home When feelings of such disenfranchisement arise as an immigrant in a new country people feel the need to express this anger sometimes publicly PERIOD

Over the past few weeks in Sweden there have been many riots by young lower class immigrants in retaliation to a bad economy and a very high unemployment rate. the most recent attack took place last week where during riots multiple cars and a school were set ablaze PERIOD Other attacks involved various buildings and cars being set ablaze leaving Swedish citizens very confused as to why their immigrants would commit these actions PERIOD Sweden welcomes immigrants and asylum seekers including those fleeing violence in countries like Iraq Somalia and Syria PERIOD The country ranks as one of the worlds happiest places. these attacks are not anything new but lately have been more consistent PERIOD In  and  immigrants clashed with the police in Malmo Sweden PERIOD The past weeks arson attacks in Stockholm and the spectacle of teenagers hurling stones at firefighters have left many Swedes wondering what went wrong in a society that has invested so much in helping their underprivileged PERIOD

These acts of terrorism as many Swedish citizens are starting to consider them have been causing mixed feelings with the nations efforts of helping and taking in underprivileged refuges from other countries PERIOD Many Swedes were baffled by the immigrants attack because the school they set ablaze consisted of  students that are all from immigrant backgrounds PERIOD Swedens Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt called the riots hooliganism while the Swedish Democrats have used these violent acts to push their antiimmigrant stance and for the deportation of immigrants who commit crime. the majority of these immigrant rioters come from the suburbs of Husby and Tensta of Stockholm PERIOD In this region the riots began May  after the police shot and killed a 69yearold immigrant holding a knife PERIOD

Additionally the major spark drawing motivation for these young immigrants is the severity of the unemployment rate PERIOD The national unemployment rate is about eight percent but the rate is at least twice as high in immigrant areas and four times as high for those under  years old PERIOD

The last prominent factor as to why so many young immigrants are rioting is because of discrimination and racism. the New York Times recently quoted a young IraqiSwedish immigrant stating Sweden has given me opportunities I didnt have in Iraq but Im not treated the same as a white guy. an older Middle Eastern immigrant that has been living successfully in Sweden for over  years commented on this issue to The Times. he mentioned how he sympathizes for these young immigrants that came here from other countries and cannot find means to make money and additionally feel discriminated against PERIOD But he says they are demanding too much for what they expected to fall in their lap upon their arrival to Sweden PERIOD

Many job seekers particularly young men had unrealistic demands and expected the state to find them work in their own neighborhoods PERIOD Many people aged from  to  want jobs now but they expect to find them right down the road from their house. this eventually becomes a government problem in not being able to find them jobs they will accept and then again when they destroy property that the Swedish government has to replace PERIOD These acts of violence committed in retaliation to the unemployment rate needs to cease PERIOD The burning of a school that educates immigrants to propel their lives is not wise. these young immigrants need to be more grateful for the opportunities given to them by the Swedish government and they need to remember beggars cannot be choosers PERIOD
