By  Wes SwietekNovember  

The football during Saturdays NIUSouthwestern Louisiana game squirmed out of players hands as if it were a block of ice and considering the weather  belowzero wind chill it must have felt like one too PERIOD

The Huskies and Southwestern Louisiana combined for  fumbles but NIUs miscues proved to be more costly as the Ragin Cajuns pulled out a  victory at frozen windwhipped Huskie Stadium PERIOD

The win gave USL  its first victory of the season while the Huskies lost their seventhstraight to drop to  PERIOD

With NIU ahead  the Ragin Cajuns winning field goal was set up when NIU return man Sean Allgood fumbled a fair catch on a punt giving USL the ball on NIUs  late in the third quarter PERIOD Four plays later Cajun kicker Richie Cunningham hit a 46yarder for the win PERIOD

The Huskies had one more chance but quarterback Stacey McKinney fumbled at USLs  with  seconds left PERIOD

It was a very closely contested football game either team could have won said a relieved USL head coach Nelson Stokley no longer facing the prospect of a winless season PERIOD

Both teams made a lot of mistakes but the weather had a lot to do with it PERIOD Were not used to conditions like this PERIOD

Ive never been in a more difficult situation it was brutal out there Stokley said of the swirling snow freezing temperatures and ferocious winds that swayed light towers like Popsicle sticks PERIOD

Not only did each squad lose four fumbles the vicious winds limited the teams to  net yards passing combined PERIOD

The cold wasnt the problem the winds were devastating NIU head coach Charlie Sadler said PERIOD You see passes that cant be completed field goals missed punts that go five yards. uSL scored first when cornerback Harold Nash took a faked punt  yards for a TD PERIOD

NIU responded when Rob Rugai who alternated at QB with McKinney hit Vaurice Patterson for a 22yard scoring pass that Patterson outwrestled a USL defender for PERIOD Willy Roy Jr.s PAT kick was no good to make it  PERIOD

A few minutes later McKinney scored on a threeyard QB keeper for a  NIU lead PERIOD Cunningham then hit a careerbest 50yard field goal to make it  at the half PERIOD The only scoring in the second half was Cunninghams gamewinning field goal PERIOD

The announced attendance was  although several thousand less actually braved the weather to watch the Huskies drop their thirdstraight home game PERIOD

Sadler said he will continue to rotate McKinney 1of4 with  yards passing  yards rushing and one TD and Rugai 1of5  yards passing with one TD one interception and  rushing yards PERIOD

Both quarterbacks can contribute to the football team Sadler said PERIOD At least for the rest of the season I see alternating QBs happening. the loss was especially hard to take for Sadler PERIOD

Our football team has done such a tremendous job of fighting through the hard times he said PERIOD It hurts from the standpoint that you hate to see guys so committed and so enthusiastic  you hate that theyre not rewarded with a victory. advertisement
