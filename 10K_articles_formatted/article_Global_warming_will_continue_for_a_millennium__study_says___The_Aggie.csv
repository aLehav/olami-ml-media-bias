The fight against global warming will not be brief PERIOD While scientists werent expecting Earth to reenter equilibrium tomorrow new research shows the ecosystem will not cool for another  years PERIOD

A report published in last weeks Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examines carbon dioxide emissions and its effects on the climate system PERIOD Susan Solomon one of the articles four authors and a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said they hoped to see what effect carbon dioxide buildup has on temperature as well as rainfall and sea level PERIOD

We were surprised to realize that the climate changes turn out to be irreversible once the carbon buildup has occurred Solomon said PERIOD That makes it different from most other pollution problems like haze PERIOD In those problems you can stop emitting if you choose to and watch the improvement happen. even if emissions stop right now the effects of carbon particles already in the atmosphere will continue to be felt because of the connectedness of the system PERIOD The study showed that the way the ocean retains carbon dioxide will keep the globe warm longer than expected PERIOD

Howard Spero a UC Davis professor in geology and paleoceanography said various climate processes interact to stabilize the climate PERIOD Because of these feedbacks the climate system will stay stable for a long time PERIOD

The climate system changes relatively slowly compared to the average human life span Spero said PERIOD Its like a big chugging engine. he said a big engine pushed onto another track will stay on that new track for a long time PERIOD

Because emissions arent going anywhere it is especially important to limit the impact we have PERIOD Spero said the potential levels mentioned in the report have not been seen in human history leading to an analog problem PERIOD The effects are unknown because there is nothing to compare it to but the report made some predictions PERIOD

Currently atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are near  parts per million by volume PERIOD Spero said preIndustrial Revolution equilibrium was about  ppmv PERIOD If concentration reaches  ppmv over the coming century the report predicted less rainfall will lead to drought similar to the dust bowl and melting grounded polar ice will raise sea level PERIOD

The less we put in the less irreversible change we will be locking into Solomon said PERIOD Or if we choose to emit even more well be locking in to big changes for future generations Im not saying what to choose but I am saying we should be aware of our choices. the studys findings regarding sea level rise and drought are sound but could be controversial since they rely on climate models said atmospheric science professor Bryan Weare PERIOD

While the conclusion sounds dire Solomon said she is optimistic PERIOD She said existing technology research and development hold a lot of promise PERIOD

Spero said the United States leads the world in per capita carbon emissions PERIOD He said we all need to help solve this problem PERIOD

We have to do a lot more in this country to come up with much more fuel efficiency Spero said PERIOD It takes citizens in this country to take a deep breath and say Im going to change. eLYSSA THOME can be reached at citytheaggie.org PERIOD
