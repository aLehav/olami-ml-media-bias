She never thought she would speak out about her eating disorder PERIOD However she took steps PERIOD Therapist PERIOD Spoken word competitions PERIOD TEDxSMU audition video

Bones barely dressed in flesh PERIOD The wheelchair cradled the death wish I was never granted spoke Baylor graduate student Lauren Bagwell PERIOD

Bagwell opened her TEDxKidsSMU discussion with a spoken word performance PERIOD She spoke about her personal journey with binge eating disorder to more than  middle school students who attended the October event PERIOD

It is estimated that  million people in the U.S PERIOD suffer from an eating disorder according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders PERIOD Binge eating is more common than bulimia and anorexia PERIOD

Sufferers feel as if they are unable to stop consuming food even when theyre not hungry PERIOD They also tend to eat food at a fast rate in one sitting PERIOD As a result many try to hide their eating habits out of shame or guilt PERIOD

Bagwell began binge eating in middle school PERIOD

I was really excited to share with middle schoolers Bagwell said PERIOD Negative body image starts really young PERIOD It is cool to be able to speak truth into their lives. many teenagers try to control their weight in unhealthy ways PERIOD The National Eating Disorder Association estimates that more than  percent of girls and almost onethird of boys do so PERIOD

Bagwell was finally diagnosed with binge eating disorder during her freshman year in college PERIOD

SMUTVs Lauren Castle interviewed Bagwell to find out more on her story PERIOD

SMUTV Explain the TEDxKidsSMU Process PERIOD Was the audience engaging

Bagwell It was exactly the audience that I needed to be with PERIOD All the students were from middle school and they all had to apply to be there PERIOD It made the environment really cool because everyone there was kind of a nerd in the best way possible. sMUTV Tell me about your spoken word PERIOD It seems like it was not your first time performing PERIOD

Bagwell Ive done spoken word since my sophomore year in high school PERIOD I competed for a while PERIOD It is kind of a really cool and authentic way to communicate stories to people PERIOD For my thesis I am looking at how spoken word can be used in the social studies setting. sMUTV Was this your first time speaking on your binge eating journey

Bagwell I was on the Dallas Youth Poetry Team PERIOD We competed in a competition called Brave New Voices PERIOD The first poem that I did was a poem that my coaches and teammates had challenged me to write PERIOD It was around the time that I got diagnosed PERIOD As I began to share my story I got more freedom from it PERIOD

It was cool because I was able to articulate a situation that I had felt like I was alone PERIOD Finding the voice in sharing that experience made me want to share it so others would know that they are not alone. sMUTV Why do you think your TED talk became popular among college women

Bagwell I think a lot of people related to it because it is more uncommon to find a girl or guy that truly loves everything about themselves PERIOD I think it is something that a lot of people struggle with but not necessarily talk about PERIOD A lot of people were waiting for a voice to describe what they are experiencing. sMUTV What do you think college students should know about eating disorders

Bagwell In my journey I struggled with the idea of your body is nothing more than the vehicle of the essence of who you are PERIOD It houses your soul PERIOD We were all given one body and one set of talents that no one else has PERIOD You cant be replaced PERIOD If you are not present on who you are then the world misses out on something that it needs. sMUTV What is the most difficult thing that suffering from binge eating go through

Bagwell I think the shame PERIOD I think there is a reason why it is the most common of the three major eating disorders and the least talked about PERIOD Especially with the growing epidemic of obesity people see overeating as selfindulging PERIOD There is a stigma that if you are overeating you can help it and you need to be active PERIOD I would say that in high school I was an athlete PERIOD I dont think anyone would considered me overweight. sMUTV Do believe society has misconceptions on binge eating If so what are they

Bagwell It is a way to feel in control and a way to feel in power PERIOD The misconception is that it is only for one gender or only for one type of person PERIOD Binge eating is probably affecting a lot more people that we lead ourselves to believe PERIOD

That is the hardest thing PERIOD To know that there is a lot of people struggling with their selfworth. make sure to watch Get Healthy Get Fit every Friday on The Daily Update PERIOD
