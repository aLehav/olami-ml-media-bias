Brian Hartnett  Thursday October  

As I write this column it is currently  degrees PERIOD In South Bend PERIOD In late October PERIOD Which means its a perfect time for me to talk about one of the most notorious aspects of Notre Dame life the weather PERIOD

South Bends weather is easily described as frigid miserable and even bipolar PERIOD The areas seemingly endless winter is marked by the appearance of an allencompassing permacloud a constant white blanket of snow and a bitter wind fierce enough to turn South Quad into a veritable wind tunnel PERIOD

However despite all these factors Im of the opinion that South Bends weather is nowhere near as bad as most Notre Dame students make it out to be PERIOD I think the climate of Michiana even enhances life at Notre Dame rather than diminishes it PERIOD

Yet I must confess that I do love warm weather and wish at times that the weather here was nicer PERIOD However in comparing my experiences to those of students at warmweather schools Ive found that Im not missing out on too much PERIOD

Although Notre Dame students may not be able to throw the Frisbee around or tan on the quad for more than  percent of the school year we do get the privilege of experiencing four seasons PERIOD

Take a look at campus right now PERIOD God Quad looks downright majestic with the wide array of vivid colored leaves dotting its trees a sight witnessed nationally by viewers when they see Notre Dame make its Saturday appearance on NBC PERIOD Speaking of football some of our teams most memorable games have come in the unpredictable fall weather PERIOD I feel many of us will still talk about our recent win over Stanford in a monsoon several decades from now PERIOD

Now on to winter PERIOD The treacherous and impassable conditions created by the constant snow may force us inside but this fact spurs most of us to really get to know those living nearest to us thereby building dorm community PERIOD And for the times we do make the trek outdoors we can enjoy events like the massive North QuadSouth Quad snowball fight or sledding on dining hall trays PERIOD

The final season in most Notre Dame students lives is spring PERIOD The constant rain in this season may make South Bend occasionally seem like Seattle but it is always glorious to see campus come back to life and the quads full of baseball gloves and lacrosse sticks PERIOD

As nice as the weather is now though temperatures this weekend are supposed to dip into the 40s PERIOD Yes well see if my feelings about the weather are still the same come Monday PERIOD
