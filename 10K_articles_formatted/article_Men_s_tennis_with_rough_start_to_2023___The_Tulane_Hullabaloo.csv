ProPalestine proIsrael protestors clash at Tulane

Mark Keplinger Sports EditorFebruary  

The Tulane mens tennis team started  by going  in their three matchups including losing both times on a rough Mississippi road trip PERIOD While the fall session consists of invitationals with multiple schools competing at a tournament the spring tennis season is defined by matchups against individual schools PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  the Furman Paladins came to New Orleans to take on the Green Wave PERIOD Playing at Tulanes home court at the City Park Tennis Center roughly a  minute drive from Tulanes Uptown campus the hosts came away  winners PERIOD

Tulane won all six singles matches with the Paladins managing to win just a single set when Paladins No PERIOD  player Jerry Barton took the first set  over Tulane No PERIOD  Fynn Kuenkler PERIOD However the Tulanian rallied to take the next two sets   to secure the match PERIOD

Furman did win the doubles point when the Paladins top two doubles pairings won their respective matches PERIOD The No PERIOD  pairings for both sides therefore did not finish their match although Tulanians Benji Jacobson and Luka Petrovic were leading PERIOD

Following this Tulane took a weekend road trip to neighboring Mississippi to take on Southeastern Conference opponents Mississippi State Bulldogs and Ole Miss Rebels PERIOD

In Starkville Mississippi the Bulldogs claimed a narrow  win for the hosts on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD On the singles side the two teams split the six matches down the middle PERIOD Top two Bulldogs players Nemanja Malesevic and Petar Jovanovic took down Kuenkler and Petrovic respectively with Malesevic needing all three sets to take down Kuenkler PERIOD At the No PERIOD  spot Bulldog Ewen Lumsden defeated Luc Hoeijmans in two sets PERIOD However Tulane tied the singles event with victories at the No PERIOD  No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  spots thanks to Billy Suarez Rafael de Alba and Sam Scherer respectively PERIOD

On the doubles side however the hosts would claim the point and the overall match with victories at the top two doubles pairing PERIOD Tulane did win the third doubles pairings but it was just a consolation PERIOD

Traveling to Oxford Mississippi on Feb PERIOD  the Rebels took down the Green Wave  PERIOD Tulane did win the doubles point after victories from their second and third pairings PERIOD However Ole Miss nearly swept the singles matches with only No PERIOD  player Alex Bancila winning his match for the Wave PERIOD

For the Green Wave there are promising signs despite the losses in Mississippi PERIOD The lower half of their singles order looks good especially with players like de Alba and Scherer PERIOD Top singles player Kuenkler is also a great piece to headline any singles rotation PERIOD The team will need to rethink their strategy on the doubles side with their top pairing not having won a match yet PERIOD

Tulane is next in action on Feb PERIOD  when the Green Wave navigates upriver to Baton Rouge to play the LSU Tigers PERIOD
