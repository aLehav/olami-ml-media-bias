The longawaited installment to Tite Kubos most popular manga series has arrived and many questions begin to reveal itself as the final confrontation between Ichigo and Yhwach draws near PERIOD

The chapter begins with the Yhwach finally meeting his long awaited target the Soul King PERIOD With no one left to stop Yhwach the Soul King is defenseless against the terror of the Quincy leader PERIOD

Many questions start to open up in these first few scenes with the first being about the inconsistency in the Soul Kings figure PERIOD We are first shown the Soul King in chapter  where it shows him with arms and legs like a normal person PERIOD However in this chapter the Soul King is shown without any arms at all which could possibly hold some meaning to it or it could just be a drawing error done by Kubo PERIOD

Yhwach claims that the Soul King has the same power to see into the future as him and that the Soul King is his father PERIOD Being that its true it does explain the similarity in their powers and their unique eyes PERIOD This also opens up a new connection between the shinigamis and quincies as they are both now directly related to each other through the Soul King PERIOD I am anxious to see how Kubo is going to intertwine these complicated connections together in the story PERIOD

With a thrust of his mighty sword Yhwach stabs the Soul King and the scene shifts to the situation thats happening down below in the Soul Society PERIOD Upon request from Kisuke Urahara everyone begins to gather to Uraharas lab and it is here that we find out that Shinji and his company made it out alive from being stuck in BazzBs lava trap PERIOD As Oomaeda begins to praise Shinjis zanpakuto powers for the reason why they were able to escape the lava it is a mystery as to what exactly Shinji did PERIOD Many of us readers already know the Shinjis shikai is able to distort the enemys perception of direction but Shinji and the group were already entrapped within BazzBs lava before Shinji was able to activate his shikai leaving many to think that Shinji had to have activated his bankai to escape from the lava PERIOD

So now the question is What powers does Shinjis bankai possess Hopefully well be able to fully witness this mysterious power in later chapters PERIOD Also can we give Kubo a round of applause for finally showing Hinamori joining in the fray

Thanks to Urahara we are given a brief status on all of the captains and vice captains in Soul Society and the thing that stands out to me is the status of Hitsugaya and Rangiku PERIOD The last time we saw them was during the battle between zombies with Captain Mayuri making poor Hitsugaya his personal zombie lab rat PERIOD Based on Urahara both Hitsugaya and Rangiku are MIA leading readers to think that Mayuri might have something in store for them being that he was the last one to come in contact with their zombified state PERIOD

As Urahara and the remaining allies in the Soul Society plan to invade the Soul Palace Ichigo and his crew are already at the scene and rushing towards Yhwachs location PERIOD Unfortunately faith in Ichigo is lacking as we are shown Ichibei silently saying to himself that Yhwach cannot be stopped PERIOD

Could Ichibei possibly have known about the outcome of the invasion What will happen now that Yhwach is victorious in taking down the Soul King The next chapter will hopefully be an exciting one as Ichigo gets closer to coming face to face with the seemingly new heir to the Soul King Yhwach PERIOD
