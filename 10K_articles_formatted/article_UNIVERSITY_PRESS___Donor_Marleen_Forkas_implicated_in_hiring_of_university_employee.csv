Editors note A monthslong investigation by the University Press has revealed the appearance of unethical behavior between donor Marleen Forkas her friend Patricia Breman and chief of staff Stacy Volnick.The Harold and Marleen Forkas Alumni Center sits on the north end of the Boca Raton campus across from the Recreation and Fitness Center PERIOD Forkas has donated a significant amount to this university.A source very close to her suggests that Forkas used the idea of donating more money down the line to influence Volnick to hire a close friend of hers.The following details Forkas involvement in getting her close friend Breman hired and the conflict that Breman carries into her job each day PERIOD



Marleen Forkas meddlesin decision making

What if the president of the United States was hand picked by the biggest donor to the government rather than through an election process It would be weird wouldnt it Not at Florida Atlantic University PERIOD

According to an anonymous source very close to the situation Marleen Forkas  who has donated over  million to the university  was involved in the selection of Patricia Breman as the interim assistant vice president for alumni affairs PERIOD

Breman a good friend of Forkas earns  per year in her new position according to emails obtained by the University Press PERIOD

She previously worked at Florida Atlantic as the assistant vice president of alumni relations from July  to March  PERIOD Both her relationship with Forkas and prior experience made Breman a quick choice to replace Bradford Crews who resigned last summer PERIOD

Breman brings a conflict of interest to her job because her sons company  one that she works for  could potentially benefit from her position PERIOD

In addition to her duties as vice president for administrative affairs and as chief administrative officer Stacy Volnick also serves as the interim vice president for institutional advancement PERIOD

Volnick knows that her selection ruffled some feathers PERIOD The thinking among some alumni and donors is that she brought back Breman this summer at the behest of Forkas PERIOD

Charles Schmidt donated all that money for the complex PERIOD Imagine if he told Pat Chun who the next football coach should be because he could donate more money down the line said the anonymous source who is both an alum and a donor PERIOD

Schmidts foundation gave  million to the school in December  to establish the Schmidt Family Complex for Academic and Athletic Excellence PERIOD Chun is the schools athletic director PERIOD

Certainly no impropriety here Volnick said adding that Bremans position carries no benefits PERIOD

It seems that the rumors are that Marleen Forkas had some type of involvement in this decision and that is simply not true. the source of those rumors

I believe that theres someone disgruntled because they werent considered she said adding that no one outside of Breman was considered to fill the interim position PERIOD I think its pretty sad that were trying to bolster a strong area of the university like advancement and someone wants to undermine that. volnick sent an email to eight people on June  announcing the official addition of Breman to the staff PERIOD Outside of Breman herself Forkas is the only person in that email chain who is not an FAU employee PERIOD

The alumni center on the Boca Raton campus is named for Marleen Forkas and her late husband Harold PERIOD According to Volnick Forkas received the email because the building is named after her PERIOD Just like we would have for anyone else she said PERIOD

Harold Forkas made a fortune during his ownership of eight Midas Muffler franchises Marleen Forkas spent several decades in the fashion industry PERIOD The two made a . million donation to the university in  to establish the alumni center PERIOD Once Harold Forkas died in  he passed on the family fortune to his wife PERIOD

The anonymous source said She was brazenly telling people that she was the one who had Breman brought in. forkas requested a University Press reporter provide two references before she spoke PERIOD After he did she did not respond to any further requests for comment PERIOD



Conflict of interest

After retiring from the FAU Foundation in  Breman began working in her sons consulting company Accelerate Exceed which has had prior contracts with the university PERIOD

FAU media relations representative Joshua Glanzer confirmed that the university hired Accelerate Exceed to help develop a strategic plan and to align Pine Jogs goals and vision with FAUs recently published  strategic plan. acccording to its website Pine Jog Environmental Education Center located in West Palm Beach is part of the FAU College of Education PERIOD

When asked if she thought that was a conflict of interest Volnick said no PERIOD To my knowledge that work was completed before in June PERIOD She started in August or something like that. the company completed its work with the Pine Jog Environmental Education Center in May PERIOD

The nature of Bremans job puts her in front of people and businesses with substantial wealth  businesses to which she could tout her sons consulting company whether or not its working for the university PERIOD

I did fundraising I raised the four and a quarter million dollars for the alumni center Breman said PERIOD My job now is the engagement of alumni. the anonymous source said Her familys business can benefit from her position now PERIOD Its a clear conflict of interest. the FAU alumni board might have been able to recognize the appearance of such a conflict but it was not consulted PERIOD Ben Dickinson chair of the Florida Atlantic University Alumni Association Board through June of this year confirmed as much PERIOD

He explained that the board is advisory in nature and doesnt actually have the power to veto or affirm any decision either way PERIOD

If they wanted to bring in Donald Trump we couldnt stop that he said PERIOD He also mentioned that he didnt know Breman had a son whose business was tied to the university PERIOD



Patricia BremanMarleen Forkas

The notion that a donor could try to involve themselves in university fundraising affairs isnt a new concept to Andrew Watt president and chief executive officer of the Association of Fundraising Professionals PERIOD He explained that there is a clear line of delineation PERIOD

Its quite acceptable for a donor to sit on a board be involved in setting the strategic direction of an organization and assume responsibility for its fiscal health he said PERIOD

Stepping beyond that to influence a hiring decision particularly for a position funded by the donor represents a real conflict of interest PERIOD It potentially allows the donor to place an individual connected to them within the organization which in turn provides them influence and access to managerial and executive decision making. breman secured more than  million in university gifts from Forkas during her first stint working with FAU PERIOD The two are close and have been for some time PERIOD

I know that Pat Breman and Marleen had a very good relationship said Dickinson PERIOD

Breman says she never approached the school about coming in on an interim basis PERIOD

I had nothing to do with my hiring Breman said PERIOD What I did have something to do with was accepting when I was approached. there is no job search to fill her position as of yet PERIOD First the school must select a new longterm vice president for advancement  right now Volnick is filling for the interim PERIOD Breman answers to her PERIOD

The search firm should be identified in the next couple weeks Volnick said in November PERIOD That firm will canvas the nation to find a new VP of Advancement who can choose to keep Breman or find someone to replace her. shes absolutely a stopgap said Dickinson of Breman PERIOD I would say she happens to be a good one because she has done the job before. he added Shes not looking to be working another  years. breman confirmed her interim status PERIOD We were very clear about that when I took the job. marleen Forkas background

Forkas is one of the universitys most generous donors PERIOD Susan H PERIOD Peirce worked with Forkas extensively during her decadelong tenure at the university PERIOD Peirce spent three years as the vice president for campaigns and seven years as the associate vice president for advancement for Florida Atlantic University and left in  PERIOD

She still works in advancement as the executive director of development at Nova Southeastern University PERIOD Peirce acknowledged that sometimes donors want to overstep their bounds PERIOD

You want to protect the donor you want to protect the institution she said PERIOD

What if a donor tries to use the notion of donating more money to get what they want I usually advise the institution not to accept the gift said Peirce PERIOD

In her current position as interim vice president of advancement Volnick deals with what she called fundraising and friendraising. fundraising deals with collecting funding and friendraising is the process of developing relationships with people who can donate funds PERIOD

According to the anonymous source Volnicks lack of experience there might have played into why she handled Forkas like she did PERIOD

Shes never been a fundraiser said the source on Volnick PERIOD She was in catering and food service before she got promoted PERIOD She has no background in fundraising. however Breman does have an extensive fundraising background PERIOD She wouldnt speak on whether the notion of getting more money from Forkas could be a reason why she was brought back PERIOD

Given the chance she did not mention her history with Forkas specifically PERIOD

I solicited funds for all of the people who donated funds to the alumni center PERIOD As you can imagine there were a lot Breman said PERIOD

Her friend Forkas has considerable wealth which makes her a possible asset to a university that puts a premium on donor dollars PERIOD

She was kept around because of the prospect of more money said the unnamed source PERIOD Shes got sway influence power PERIOD It needs to stop. wesley Wright is the business manager of the University Press and one of its senior reporters PERIOD He can be reached at emailprotected or on Twitter PERIOD
