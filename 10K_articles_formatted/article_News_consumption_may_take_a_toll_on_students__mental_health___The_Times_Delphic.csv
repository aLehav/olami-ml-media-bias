Drake University is an epicenter of cultural discourse surrounding students with news and views from across the spectrum PERIOD However constantly being plugged in might be causing students to stress out PERIOD

According to the American Psychological Associations annual Stress in America survey more than half of adults say they want to stay informed but keeping up with the news causes them stress PERIOD This creates a split where individuals feel as if they must choose between staying informed and staying positive PERIOD

I feel like I see a lot more bad news than good news recently  all the reports of everything thats going wrong in the world Esther Gendler said PERIOD

While TV news remains the dominant form of consumption for older Americans according to the Pew Research Center news consumption is done primarily online for adults  PERIOD

The youngest of these ages  cite social media as their goto news outlet PERIOD

I follow a lot of accounts on social media so if I see something that sparks my interest Ill click on it PERIOD I check The New York Times website pretty frequently as well Gendler said PERIOD

Secondyear student Kylee Macke echoes these sentiments PERIOD

I get a lot of news from Twitter said Macke PERIOD If it pops up in my feed and Im interested in learning about it then Ill go to Apple News or look it up  Social media is my main form of staying up to date with politics PERIOD Being at Drake too though especially in the Jschool PERIOD Im more politically conscious than ever. gendler also cites social media as one of the primary ways she stays uptodate on politics PERIOD

I follow candidates on their social media platforms and try to read articles about them pretty frequently Gendler said PERIOD

With students being surrounded by news both online and off it may be difficult for them to remain calm and collected in the face of an increasingly bleak news cycle PERIOD While the easy solution would be to just shut the phone off at times this is no easy feat PERIOD In fact research suggests growing up in the digital age may have had an effect on Gen Zs impulse control PERIOD

The famous marshmallow test an experiment designed to measure selfcontrol has been given to children in three different decades PERIOD The resulting data published in Developmental Psychology shows that children born in the 2000s were able to wait up to a minute longer before consuming their marshmallow than children born in the 80s and two minutes longer than those born in the 1960s PERIOD This impulse control could easily translate to selfregulation of media intake or lack thereof PERIOD

Macke said she began using social media in fifth grade and got her first smartphone just a few years later around age  meaning shes been plugged in roughly half of her life PERIOD

Ive just kind of figured it out  I dont really feel the need to limit myself Macke said PERIOD I can go without. jNews  Premium WordPress news  magazine theme by Jegtheme PERIOD
