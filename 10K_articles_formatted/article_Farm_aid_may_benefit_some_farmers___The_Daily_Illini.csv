2461,2023-11-04,"gov PERIOD Pat Quinn announced that disaster relief would be provided to farmers in  counties that have suffered flooding or excessive rain damage to crops in September PERIOD

Champaign County was not one of them PERIOD

However at least some of the  farms in the county will still seek monetary relief for crop loss PERIOD

Brad Uken manager at the Champaign County Farm Bureau said that because the county is next to Piatt County and Douglas County which have both suffered damages due to heavy rain and flooding it is eligible for relief PERIOD

But many farm owners in Champaign are likely unaware of the legislation that could help provide financial support Uken said PERIOD



A lot of them are going to be thinking about the harvest right now he added PERIOD

The federal legislation requires each farm to apply for the aid separately Uken said PERIOD Applications are considered on a casebycase basis PERIOD

Not everyone will be able to qualify for aid since farmers must show they have experienced crop loss between April  and July  PERIOD

If the farmers think they qualify they should contact their county farm agency office and staff in that agency can verify whether producers have crop loss that is eligible for emergency funds said Kelly Kraft spokeswoman for Gov PERIOD Quinn PERIOD

The aid will be provided to the farmers on the basis of loss as well as compliance with Farm Service Agency regulations said Yvonne Odom the county executive director for the Farm Service Agency PERIOD

The agency requires that farms report their acreage every year have crop insurance and comply with other stipulations Odum said PERIOD

The farmers must also provide delivery lists that show the years production for different crops PERIOD

Whether the amount of crop loss is large enough will be judged on the revenue of the farm this year in comparison to previous years PERIOD

A similar piece of legislation called the  Farm Bill will also provide some monetary relief to farmers who have suffered crop loss PERIOD

The Supplemental Revenue Assistance Program SURE will offer disaster relief to Champaign farmers who apply for it and who comply with the Farm Service Agency requirements PERIOD

The SURE program has allots money for disaster relief until  PERIOD

If the money is used up before then no provisions will be added unless Congress decides to allocate more funds Odum said PERIOD

She said the excessive rain and flooding have not had a huge impact on Champaign County farms and many farmers may not seek aid PERIOD

Overall the county hasnt had a huge disaster she said PERIOD

There was some flooding early on in the year that delayed farmers from planting their crops Odum said PERIOD Later that season there was some flooding in the lower areas that damaged the crops that had already been planted PERIOD

Uken said the damage may concern some Champaign County farmers but the process for acquiring aid might be beneficial PERIOD

We think its a program that some individual farmers will want to look at he said PERIOD

Steve Ayers a farm owner and educator for University of Illinois Extension in Champaign County said he had a few grain quality issues but the harvest is likely going to be successful PERIOD

Ironically were looking at an aboveaverage crop he said PERIOD

Ayers said even while the prospects are good this farming season will be expensive because of delayed planting PERIOD

We finally got a crop in he added PERIOD I dont see the disaster declaration as much of a disaster. despite all the rain and flooding Ayers said he is glad to see the crops turning out well PERIOD

For the season we had its closer to a miracle he said PERIOD",Farm aid may benefit some farmers - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
