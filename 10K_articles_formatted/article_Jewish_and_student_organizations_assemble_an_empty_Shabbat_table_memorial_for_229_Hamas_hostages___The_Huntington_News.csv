A stillness engulfed Cabot Quad which was covered with an expanse of empty tables and chairs for two and a half hours Friday afternoon as passersby observed a Shabbat memorial organized for Hamas hostages PERIOD One hundred and sixty chairs lined tables laid out for a traditional Shabbat dinner with plates and forks alongside bottles of untouched grape juice and challah PERIOD Blue and white balloons tied to the chairs swayed in the wind as the sun beamed down on the memorial but the surroundings remained quiet PERIOD

The demonstration was organized by a group of Jewish and Israeli organizations on campus including Northeastern Hillel Huskies for Israel Northeastern Mishelanu Chabad at Northeastern Zeta Beta Tau Alpha Epsilon Pi the Israeli American Council and Stand With Us PERIOD It honored the hundreds of people Hamas has taken hostage since Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Around the world communities set up empty tables to honor the hostages before Shabbat the holiest night of the week PERIOD Although the number of hostages is believed to be around  people only  chairs could fit on Cabot Quad according to Hillel member Inbar Ofer a fifthyear computer science and behavioral neuroscience combined major PERIOD Since Oct PERIOD  the day of the first attack there have been four Shabbats that the hostages missed PERIOD

Our brains have a hard time visualizing statistics so just seeing it all in front of me it really hit just how many people are still hostage Ofer said PERIOD I mean only  chairs fit on the quad and so we were short by  chairs and it still felt massive to me. students with family and friends in Israel say they constantly worry for their loved ones safety PERIOD Hillel member Shira Ashkenazi a thirdyear international affairs major who was born and raised in Kiryat Ono a suburb of Tel Aviv said she and other Israeli students are still grappling with the loss and violence PERIOD

Its really hard to be so far away from home and feel so helpless and powerless she said PERIOD Its so important to be with my community right now and to partake in things like this for all those lives for all those kidnapped for all our friends and families PERIOD We just want them to return safely home. this memorial comes during a period of heightened antisemitism Ofer said PERIOD The Biden administration announced on Monday that the Department of Homeland Security the Department of Justice and the Department of Education would work in conjunction with college campus law enforcement to address the rising threat of antisemitism PERIOD

In response to the Oct PERIOD  attacks President of Huskies for Israel Mark Antar a secondyear economics and finance combined major said he intentionally shifted his focus for the organization from educationheavy events to community gatherings to support Jewish and Israeli students PERIOD

Its really so important for us to come together now more than ever to help one another because if we dont help each other whos going to help us We are our strongest assets Antar said PERIOD Were our strongest allies. since the first attack students say they have connected to other Jewish and Israeli students on campus in search of a community PERIOD I know that ever since this started Ive met so many more Jews and Israelis on campus that I didnt know were here Ashkenazi said PERIOD

Ive been participating a lot in Hillel events since Oct PERIOD  because it feels like the only thing Im able to do that means something in the context of this said Isaac Kaper a fifthyear computer science and computer engineering combined major PERIOD I think for me with everything going on and the subsequent negative reactions it was more important than ever to just feel at home with other people who understand what is happening in order to support each other as we get through this time. president of Hillel Julia Gilinsky a fourthyear accounting major says Hillel continues to host Shabbat dinners every Friday which she said gives students an opportunity to find community PERIOD

We have more than a hundred people coming out every week PERIOD The numbers have never been this great she said PERIOD Its really heartwarming to see how close people have gotten to each other its really unfortunate that our community has gotten so much closer because of this. the independent student newspaper of Northeastern University",Jewish and student organizations assemble an empty Shabbat table memorial for 229 Hamas hostages - The Huntington News,Northeastern University
