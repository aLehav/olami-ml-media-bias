Ask head football coach Rocky Hager what he will remember most about Kendrick Ballantyne and you wont have to wait long for a response PERIOD

A play PERIOD Fourthandfive PERIOD Overtime New Hampshire PERIOD The catch break a tackle score a touchdown he said PERIOD

The 6foot 4inch senior tight ends 20yard touchdown catch from sophomore quarterback John Sperrazza put the Huskies within one point in the Oct PERIOD  game PERIOD Minutes later a Sperrazza pass to sophomore halfback Alex Broomfield gave the Huskies a stunning  homecoming win over  thenNo PERIOD  New Hampshire PERIOD

Ballantyne had five catches for  yards in the game including two touchdowns contributing to his teamleading total of  catches for  yards and seven touchdowns PERIOD He established himself as one of the top tight ends in the Atlantic10 while being named AllNew England by the New England Football Writers Association and also named to the Atlantic10 AllConference second team PERIOD But the fact that Ballantyne even played for Northeastern is almost serendipitous PERIOD

The Gorham Maine native originally attended the University of Maine PERIOD But his involvement in a fight at a football party landed him and five other players on the fast track off the team PERIOD He got a second chance with Hager starting his first year at Northeastern PERIOD

I saw him on film and he showed some athleticism PERIOD The one thing that we did identify was that as a tight end he was not much of a blocker and hes worked very hard to develop himself to be an adequate blocker. due to NCAA transfer rules Ballantyne had to redshirt his first year as a Husky PERIOD But he didnt let this hold him back at practice PERIOD

The year he was redshirted he was scout player every day Hager said PERIOD He lined up and he went every day PERIOD When he got banged up a little bit he kept going PERIOD He showed a degree of toughness that was desirable for any football program. he finally hit the field his junior year as a Husky posting  catches for  yards and a score in six games before dislocating his elbow against William  Mary Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

As a junior he was doing pretty nicely for us and he dislocated his elbow Hager said PERIOD

His efforts in the rehabilitation phase were very good as well and consequently he earned the respect of his teammates PERIOD A year ago at this time he was constantly in the weight room to the point that he was selected as the Iron Man for his efforts through the summer PERIOD That says an awful lot about the example he set off the field as well as on the field. ballantyne  earned the respect of his teammates and was voted cocaptain to begin the  season PERIOD

In  games with Northeastern Ballantyne totaled  receptions for  yards and eight touchdowns averaging . yards per game PERIOD His careerhigh reception 75yard pass against Holy Cross  Sept PERIOD  was the longest by a Husky since  PERIOD

His hard work and willingness to improve are qualities that will no doubt be useful in the NFL draft on April  and  PERIOD

This semester Ballantyne has split time between Northeastern and Florida where he is training with a strength and conditioning coach to prepare for the draft PERIOD

While he might not be drafted he stands a good chance of being signed as a free agent in the days following the draft Hager said PERIOD

For Ballantyne to succeed in the NFL Hager said he needs to stay healthy as well as continue to be a strong special teams player and learn the offensive system of whichever team he winds up on PERIOD

In the NFL its called  and its  football PERIOD Theres an hour or so for lifting an hour or so for eating a couple of hours for practice but the rest of the time is  the cerebral part and by golly you better know how things fit themselves together Hager said PERIOD

His confidence and work ethic should help him as he makes the transition to the pros Hager said PERIOD

Hes a person that had some confidence believed that he could make some plays he said PERIOD And he did make some plays PERIOD Wherever he goes hell do the best he can and the right things will happen. the independent student newspaper of Northeastern University",Senior Spotlight: Ballantyne looks to catch on in NFL - The Huntington News,Northeastern University
