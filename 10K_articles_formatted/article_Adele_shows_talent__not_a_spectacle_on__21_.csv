One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

In a music industry haunted by Britney Spears scandals and gimmicky Gaga stunts its no wonder female performers get such a bum rap PERIOD Our culture buzzes with reasons to dismiss these artists as superficial or corny  after all how seriously can you take someone who sings about brushing her teeth with alcohol

 Columbia

Dont be fooled by her multiple award nominations Grammys and frequent VH1 Radio Countdown appearances Adele is more than your average mainstream artist PERIOD With her raw honest voice and bluesy style the 22yearold singersongwriter has used the power of her music alone to rise to the top of pop charts PERIOD By releasing her second album  the British star has proven once again that she has what it takes to stand out from her peers  without the aid of reality shows or bubble costumes PERIOD

Despite the popularity of sleazy pop songs and overwhelming dance beats 21s sincerity is what makes it shine PERIOD Its earnestness is felt in Dont You Remember a simple yet powerful ballad of a relationship gone awry PERIOD Though its topic and lyrics arent revolutionary by any means Adeles singing style glosses the song with gusto PERIOD Her voice is tinged with passion and pain taking on the qualities of soft and explosive tones as she pleas for her lost lover to return PERIOD Its a voice that makes even the most generic please remember me lines moving resonating with any girl who has suffered from a broken heart PERIOD As she sings its tempting to find the guy shes singing about on Facebook and send him a meddling message to bring the two back together  anything to console her heartfelt wails PERIOD

Though they probably wont bring listeners to their knees in empathy 21s faster tracks are just as authoritative as Dont You Remember. numbers like Rolling in the Deep swing with soul and emotional fury creating a musical storm with chorusstyle backup vocals and jazzy instruments PERIOD The lead vocals thunder with confidence as Adele threatens some scumbag Youre gonna wish you had never met me. its the kind of track  bold and irresistibly catchy  that inspires impromptu car singing sessions unapologetically filling the vehicle with bass and girl power PERIOD

However not all of  lives up to the vigor of Dont You Remember and Rolling in the Deep. some tracks like Lovesong sound stale  though not unpleasant they just dont create the same emotional rush as other funkier numbers PERIOD Still Adeles radiant vocals help to salvage even the least exciting parts of the album adding personal touches to otherwise average tales of heartache PERIOD

There is something to be said for Adeles modest musical style and the popularity its gaining  rivaling artists with more years of experience more album releases and larger wig collections PERIOD  is a breath of fresh natural air in an industry that quakes with gaudy personas and tabloid appearances PERIOD With its fiery vocals and punchy instrumentals the album gives hope to the future of mainstream pop Maybe one day musicians will be judged solely on their sound not their resemblance to a Ringling Brothers act PERIOD
