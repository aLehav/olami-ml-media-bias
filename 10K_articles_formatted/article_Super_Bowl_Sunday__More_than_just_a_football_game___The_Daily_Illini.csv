2322,2023-10-26,"im looking forward to Super Bowl Sunday PERIOD I mean who isnt

Im not looking forward to the main event the battle between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers PERIOD

Instead Im talking about chicken wings chips and salsa beer potato wedges cheese dip  a food coma that rivals the feeling of lethargy and dopiness after a Thanksgiving feast PERIOD

Im talking about sorting through my many party invitations to see which one deserves the grace of my presence PERIOD

Im talking about the Puppy Bowl where I melt from the cuteness of the last pooch standing PERIOD Im talking about falling crazy in love with Beyonc while watching her act like a naughty girl PERIOD



And Im talking about the mixed curseblessing of a Super Bowl commercial playing on repeat in my head for the next week PERIOD

The other day my friend asked me who was playing in the Super Bowl PERIOD She didnt even wait for me to answer before she said More importantly what are we going to eat during the Super Bowl

Super Bowl Sunday has evolved into something greater than a football game PERIOD Its an American event one that could arguably be made into a national holiday well save the Super Bowl Monday should be a day off work column for another day and an occasion celebrated by those of all ages colors sizes and ethnicities PERIOD Its even celebrated by the people dont like football PERIOD

Maybe youre different FROM what Im going to label as the norm of Super Bowl watchers maybe youre what one would call a diehard football fan PERIOD

For you I have a quiz

 PERIOD Who won the  Super Bowl and what team did they beat

 PERIOD Whose nipple was revealed during a wardrobe malfunction during the  Super Bowl halftime show and who exposed said blouse puppy PERIOD

Answers

 PERIOD The New England Patriots beat the Carolina Panthers  PERIOD

 PERIOD In what is sometimes referred to as Nipplegate beloved boyband heartbreaker Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Janet Jacksons costume PERIOD

My hypothesis is the majority of readers got No PERIOD  right and not No PERIOD  PERIOD People remember the drama and the conflict that happened more than the actual game PERIOD

It isnt like this for every sporting event Ill give you that PERIOD

The Super Bowl is a phenomenon it is bigger than any other sporting event PERIOD For three straight years the Super Bowl has broken its own record as the most watched television event  last year an estimated . million people watched PERIOD

The Super Bowl is a bigger deal than everything else because its one of the only sporting events with one championship game allowing for more finality and drama PERIOD The World Series the Stanley Cup Final and the NBA Finals are all spread out over possibly seven games PERIOD People are less likely to watch all of those especially if they dont care for any of the teams playing PERIOD

Because the Super Bowl takes place on just one day it opens up countless doors that have businessmen across the world smiling PERIOD

All of the business moguls efforts can be concentrated around one broadcast in one location which means they pool all their resources to this day and it makes the events all the more exciting PERIOD Every year business tycoons are trying to make the hype around the Super Bowl bigger and better than ever PERIOD

This year theres already been the debauchery of Super Bowl Media Day breakfasts dinners a bowling event a VH1 Best SuperBowl Concert Ever and probably a hundred other things I dont even care to know PERIOD Then during the main event theres Beyonc at halftime whats sure to be a slew of enthralling commercials and hopefully some preshow or halftime dramas to keep everybody on the edge of their seats PERIOD

And for that Ill keep watching the Super Bowl to see what corporate America can cook up next PERIOD Not because I care about the Ravens or the 49ers PERIOD Which I dont PERIOD
