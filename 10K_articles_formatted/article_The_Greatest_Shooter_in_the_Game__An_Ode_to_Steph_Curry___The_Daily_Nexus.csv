Chef Curry PERIOD The BabyFaced Assassin PERIOD The Human Torch PERIOD

The Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry has earned a bunch of nicknames throughout his storied career PERIOD Already a twotime and once unanimous MVP threetime champion and greatest shooter ever by the age of  Currys career is almost perfect PERIOD Hes currently playing against his younger brother in the Western Conference Finals and is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and former Virginia Tech Volleyball player Sonya Curry to the casual observer it must look like he was destined for greatness PERIOD If youve followed him closely throughout the years however you would know that that wasnt always the case PERIOD

I certainly didnt think I was watching an alltime great player when I first really started following the Warriors my freshman year of high school PERIOD Up to that point my knowledge of the Dubs mostly revolved around my older family memberss memories of the Run TMC era being snuck into Oakland bars as a kid to watch the  We Believe Team and being oddly drawn to shooting guard Kelenna Azubuike because of his awesome name PERIOD I certainly remember feeling furious that Monta Ellis didnt get an AllStar bid and venting with my stepfather when we traded him for Andrew Bogut PERIOD Still other than my friends and I regrettably nicknaming Curry Noodle Legs because of his ankle injuries none of the early memories of my Warriors fandom really involved him PERIOD

That all changed in the  NBA playoffs PERIOD

The Warriors were a plucky sixseed that year led by secondyear coach Mark Jackson and Steph Curry who had garnered national attention earlier in the season when he scored  points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden PERIOD Most Warriors fans at that point had conceded that trading Ellis was the right way to go but I personally still wasnt sure how far Curry could take us PERIOD Little did I know that this would be the debut of one of the most dominant postseason players the game has ever seen PERIOD

Steph was on fire in the first round against the Nuggets torching the Denver defense for two 30point performances sandwiched around a 29point game and leading the Warriors to their first playoff series victory in six years PERIOD When he then turned around and dropped  points in the first game of the Western Conference Semifinals on the Spurs the whole league was put on notice and people started to understand that this guard who had been hampered by injuries could really ball PERIOD

He elevated himself from a good shooter to a great player and after losing to the Clippers in an emotionally charged firstround series in  the stage was set for him to truly take his game to the next level PERIOD

And thats exactly what he did PERIOD

Curry did more than just change public perception during his first MVP season in  he actually shifted the landscape of the entire NBA PERIOD While old heads like Charles Barkley dismissed the eventual champion Warriors as a jumpshooting team while an East Coastbiased media elevated teams like the Hawks or Cavs over the Dubs while Houston fans and their team obnoxiously campaigned for James Harden to win the Most Valuable Player award  Steph and the Warriors just kept on winning PERIOD

They eventually faced off against the Grit n Grind Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the  playoffs and as Curry sunk shots from the opposing freethrow line it was almost as if we could see the passing of the torch right in front of our eyes PERIOD The Warriorss ball movement quick and smart defense and shotmaking ability simply brushed off the outdated bully ball style of the Grizzlies and it was all catalyzed by number  PERIOD

Steph would end up leading the Warriors to a championship following up with the greatest offensive season in history in which he averaged . points on  shooting and won a unanimous MVP PERIOD Being hampered by injuries and losing in seven games to the Cavs would also bring over Kevin Durant to create the best duo to ever step on a basketball court PERIOD

Two championships later this is where we stand PERIOD Curry already has the resume of the secondbest point guard of all time PERIOD He is the leader of the statistically greatest starting lineup in NBA history ranks ninth in points per game in the playoffs and is blowing away threepoint shooting records with ease PERIOD When Kevin Durant went down with an injury this year it was Curry with  points in the second half of game six to bury the rival Houston Rockets and advance to the Western Conference Finals PERIOD

The only inconsistent part of Currys game now seems to be the criticism levied against him and his team PERIOD

At first the Warriors were unfair because they got Kevin Durant PERIOD Then the Warriors needed Kevin Durant in order to win the championship PERIOD At first Curry isnt clutch because he doesnt have a finals MVP PERIOD Then when he does carry the team hes a frontrunner or showboat PERIOD At first the Warriors were a soft jumpshooting team that lucked into a finals PERIOD Then they became an illegalscreening dirty powerhouse that bullied lesser squads into oblivion PERIOD

While media talkingheads try to get their narratives together before another Warriors championship victory Curry just continues to add to his legacy PERIOD

He is the most selfless superstar the game has seen embodies a leader in the truest sense of the word and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of NBA players PERIOD He is not just part of the greatest offense in the league but is himself the greatest offense in the league PERIOD His gravity and the way he stretches out opposing defenses is something that has never been seen before PERIOD

When his career is done when the Warriors are back to being a middleofthepack team playing in an overpriced San Francisco stadium when their championship hopes are nothing but a memory he will be talked about in the same way we talk about legends like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird PERIOD

We should be grateful that we get to see him in his prime now PERIOD
