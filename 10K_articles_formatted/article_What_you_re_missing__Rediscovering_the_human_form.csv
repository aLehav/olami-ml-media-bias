One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Walking into the art studio on the ground floor of Alice Lloyd Residence Hall is both exciting and daunting PERIOD Dried paint that once dripped from paintbrushes coats the counters and floors PERIOD Handprints sketches and signatures overpower the walls PERIOD The sink area is an art project in itself PERIOD The atmosphere complemented by the sounds of Buena Vista Social Club is a welcoming one PERIOD

Yet the Open Figure Drawing Workshop taught by Mark Tucker the Arts on the Hill program coordinator and Lloyd Hall Scholars Program lecturer isnt for the easily discomfited PERIOD Confirmed by the occasional giggling of passersby not everyone is prepared for what they witness PERIOD Those that attend the workshops do not draw still lifes  they draw nude models PERIOD

Arts on the Hill the workshops sponsor began seven years ago as a housing initiative spurred by the need to create extracurricular activities PERIOD Tuckers Open Figure Drawing Workshop has existed since the program began and takes place from  to  p.m PERIOD Tuesdays and Thursdays PERIOD Anyone is welcome to grab some complimentary charcoal and a sketchpad PERIOD Although the workshops are free and open to the public the majority of its participants are college students PERIOD

For the eager beginner the first class may be somewhat of a culture shock PERIOD

Its not like a nudist colony Tucker said PERIOD It is interesting how in our society we are exposed to so much partial nudity that we dont see it anymore. for some observing a live model rather than mundane objects enables a heightened emotional connection to their work PERIOD The setup allows for a conceptualization of the human body divergent from the medias desensitizing images PERIOD For Tucker the presence of nude models also encourages dynamic instruction PERIOD

The involvement of the model University alum Ray Schnueringer spans eight years beginning when a friend requested that he model for a course at Eastern Michigan University PERIOD Though he found the ordeal unnerving at first Schnueringer has since modeled for figure drawing and sculpture courses through the University Eastern and the Steiner School PERIOD During the hourlong sessions at Alice Lloyd Schnueringer rotates between standing sitting and reclining poses every five to seven minutes PERIOD

Although Tuckers workshop has previously employed other models Schnueringers consistent presence demonstrates his passion for being a small part of the students creative ventures PERIOD Having worked together since the program began Tucker and Schnueringer share an amiable familiarity strengthening the workshops appeal and its lighthearted funloving nature PERIOD

He is so patient and works with people on all different levels Schnueringer said of Tucker PERIOD Tuckers priority is helping his students find their creative voice PERIOD Humor and ease fill his classroom PERIOD

The workshops provide a common arena for artists whether professional practicing or selfproclaimed PERIOD For one hour twice a week the blandness of the world can be imitated shaded over or perfected by a swipe of the hand PERIOD

Open Figure Drawing Workshop
Tuesdays and Thursdays at  p.m PERIOD
At the Alice Lloyd Art Studio ground floor
