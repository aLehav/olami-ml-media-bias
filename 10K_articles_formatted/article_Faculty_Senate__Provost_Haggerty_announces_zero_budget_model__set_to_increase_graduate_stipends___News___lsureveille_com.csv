We need to make sure we increase our graduate stipends to a level that is nationally competitive and where students are not having to eat from the food bank or wait to have wisdom teeth pulled until they can save up enough money Haggerty said PERIOD Sowe need to provide stipends that are livable with basic health benefits. beginning on July   the university will move toward a zerobased budget for a small number of years Haggerty said PERIOD After that the university may move toward something that takes less effort he said PERIOD

He defined the zerobased budget framework as one in which units of an organization in this case individual colleges propose a budget to the administration of an organization the university and have justified every single line in that budget this excludes tenured staff PERIOD

After that Haggerty said college deans will need to propose their budget for the  fiscal year which is due Jan PERIOD   PERIOD

In terms of graduate stipends Haggerty said the university created a team consisting of a council of faculty graduate students vice provost and dean of LSU Graduate School James Spencer a representative from human resources and a representative from the budget office to provide an implementation plan to bring the graduate stipend to a minimum of  on a ninemonth basis along with a basic healthcare benefit package PERIOD The team has met twice so far he said PERIOD

The team will deliver this plan to Haggerty in three stages the first stage set to be delivered around Dec PERIOD  PERIOD The second stage of information will be delivered Feb PERIOD  which will include information sufficient enough for the office to write offer letters for graduate stipends PERIOD The complete implementation will go into effect on July  Haggerty said PERIOD

We should not be paying graduate students a stipend that they cannot afford to live on in Baton Rouge Louisiana Haggerty said PERIOD Im sure we can all agree on that PERIOD We have to increase this okay Morally we have to do this and practically as well because currently were not competitive. haggerty said he will ask the state legislature for additional funding for the plan but the university shouldnt rely on that PERIOD The university must move forward Haggerty said and increasing the stipend is the way to do that PERIOD

Senator Robert Cook a professor representing the science department said he agrees it needs to be done but that a lot of guidance on technicalities is needed in these early stages PERIOD

Senator Sarah Rosser an instructor representing the English Department is also in support but expressed concerns about the plans small salary difference between graduate students and instructors PERIOD She said it is a morale killer for instructors struggling to get by as professionals PERIOD

Were looking at a  difference between a graduate student and a fulltime instructor Rosser said PERIOD Thats discouraging PERIOD We are the dark horses as composition instructors and we are thrilled to see the university growing with all of the incoming freshmen but is that disparity in your mind at this point

Haggerty responded adding that there needs to be faculty raises across the board including instructors PERIOD He agreed that instructors need to be paid a fair wage and said he hopes the implementation of the plan isnt demoralizing PERIOD

Senator Mostafa Elseifi a professor representing the Civil Engineering Department was concerned that the state support in Louisiana is not there. he said that during his time at Virginia Tech he found they didnt have the same problem PERIOD In response Haggerty cited his experience increasing stipends at Oregon State University as the dean of the College of Science as an example showing that it can be done PERIOD

Haggerty said the university cant continue abusing graduate students this way. its like gravity PERIOD We dont like gravity all the time but we have to obey the law of gravity PERIOD We cant pay our graduate students     thousand a year and not give them health benefits he said PERIOD I dont have an answer for every particular grant or other kind of question but itll have to fit in the budget we have. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
