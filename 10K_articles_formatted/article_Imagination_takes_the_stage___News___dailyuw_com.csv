Its somewhere right after the first appearance of Iff  a  from an invisible  in the bathroom when the realization that this really is a childrens tale strikes PERIOD

But consider that this particular childrens story was written by author Salman Rushdie  in hiding after his book The Satanic Versus was banished in many Islamic countries PERIOD An official decree called a fatwa was even issued against his life by Iranian orthodox Muslims PERIOD

Suddenly it gets harder to characterize Haroun and The Sea of Stories as just another Bull and Frog a humorous yet thoroughly skindeep play at the Seattle Childrens Theatre PERIOD

Haroun in the guise of a distant fantasy in illogical worlds is actually Rushdies explanation to his son of the conflicted world that forced his seclusion PERIOD Whether it be in the  or through Haroun and Iffs other adventures while a character named Butt serves as their guide probably best if you let names and titles pass the UW School of Dramas production of Haroun is imaginatively spectacular PERIOD Depictions of the ordinary and extraordinary are done in such fashions that fingers tapping subtly set a steady falling rain and giant winged creatures capture the entire stage with two pieces of cloth PERIOD

In the Playbill the School of Dramas Distinguished Visiting Director Aaron Posner thanks the cast staff and design team for  Posner himself earns accolades for making the final production of the Professional Actors Training Program class of  an amazing one PERIOD At almost all points of the production all twelve of the classs participants are on stage either as narrators or characters or background noise and yet never drawing attention away from that which should be focused upon PERIOD

The colorful set design by Andrea Bush makes the program especially exhilarating filled with trap doors and hidden corners that allow for the many characters necessarily quick entrances and exits PERIOD Andy Smiths lighting design creates focal points that enhance the mysticism of many scenes PERIOD

Like most childrens tales Haroun ends happily  but what that really means would be too complicated to explain PERIOD Suffice to say the heavy themes are lightened but not lost as long as you are looking amid distant worlds of rhyme and little reason PERIOD
