Sophomore infielder Evan Mendoza tips off a foul ball PERIOD Mendoza was atbat four times during the game bringing in one hit and one run PERIOD The NC State baseball team beat Wake Forest  at Doak Field at Dail Park on April  PERIOD

Two season ago Evan Mendoza was a pitcher with a . eRA in nine appearances. last season he led NC State in batting average as the starting third baseman PERIOD

Only a year after converting from pitcher to position player Mendoza went on to bat a teamhigh . and start  games for the Wolfpack during the  season PERIOD

Originally from Maryland Mendoza moved to Sarasota Florida after his freshman year of high school and was named the Herald Tribune Preps AllArea pitcher of the year in Florida his senior year at Sarasota High PERIOD All signs pointed to him continuing as a pitcher when he committed to play for NC State PERIOD

He came here as a twoway player but in my eyes he was always more of a pitcher said head coach Elliott Avent PERIOD He was outstanding in the fall so I penciled him in as a pitcher. now a junior Mendoza himself thought that his college career might take a different path when he first got to NC State PERIOD

In high school I was doing both all the way up until senior year Mendoza said PERIOD I was probably more focused on pitching because I was just better at it. after being sparingly used out of the bullpen and making just a few appearances in the field in  Mendoza knew he had to make a change PERIOD Halfway through his freshman year he started his transition from pitching to being a position player PERIOD

Mendoza had always been both a pitcher and position player growing up but hitting in college compared to lower levels is markedly different PERIOD While he had faith in his own defensive capabilities he knew he had to focus on offense if he was going to become a fulltime position player PERIOD

It was just a lot of hard work Mendoza said PERIOD I remember going down in the cages hit off the self machine PERIOD You dont need anyone else PERIOD You can hit at  in the morning you can hit at  in the morning whatever time you want PERIOD I used that as much as I could. mendoza was sure to make Avent aware of his desire to play a position PERIOD

Evan kept telling me how bad he wanted to play how much he wanted to play and I listened to him Avent said PERIOD I said Okay fine go out that summer and he went to Maryland and proved he could play a position and he did PERIOD He worked his butt off and hes come back here. mendoza spent the summer after his freshman year playing for the Baltimore Dodgers of the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League hitting . in  atbats while playing the infield PERIOD He was also named to the CRCBL AllLeague Second team as a second baseman proving he could handle being a fulltime position player at the collegiate level PERIOD

When he arrived back in Raleigh he was determined to win a starting spot for the upcoming season PERIOD

Mendoza did just that leading the team in batting average in  while making  starts in the field and appearing in  games overall a majority of them at third base PERIOD He also logged four home runs  RBIs and a stellar . oBP in his first season playing the field fulltime PERIOD

This past summer Mendoza played in the Cape Cod Baseball League in Massachusetts which is generally considered the top summer league for college players around the country PERIOD He continued his excellent offensive production as a member of the Bourne Braves hitting a teamhigh . with a  OPS PERIOD He also made just one error in  games playing the infield PERIOD

That was a great experience Mendoza said PERIOD I had a lot of fun met a lot of great players had a lot of characters on the team PERIOD Just a lot of guys that made you laugh really enjoy the game. after the  season ended in heartbreaking fashion for the Wolfpack in the regional Mendoza has high expectations for the talented  squad PERIOD

No doubt win the national championship or get to Omaha Mendoza said of the teams goals PERIOD With the talent and hard work were putting in this year and past years I think we have a pretty good shot of making it pretty far this year. as fall practices wrap up players are still trying to find their role on the team but Mendoza seems to have cemented his place in the lineup PERIOD No matter how far the Wolfpack makes it this season Mendoza will certainly look to continue to make an impact as a position player PERIOD

Im as proud of Evan as any player Ive ever had here Avent said PERIOD Hes grown as a person hes grown as a player he means a lot to this ball club and hes fun to watch play. log In
