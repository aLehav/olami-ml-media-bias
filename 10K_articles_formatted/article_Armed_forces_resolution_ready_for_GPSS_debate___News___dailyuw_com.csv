Updated November     pm



One day after several ASUW senators introduced a resolution to support Americans in the U.S PERIOD military the Graduate and Professional Student Senate GPSS executive committee passed a similar resolution for debate for the next GPSS general meeting PERIOD

Vice President Sumeer Singla and Secretary Lincoln Beauregard submitted the resolution Wednesday night PERIOD

If passed the ASUW resolution will show the UW is grateful  Meanwhile the GPSS will recognize the difference between supporting Americas armed forces and supporting the war itself as well as fully supporting Americas service members PERIOD

 said Singla PERIOD

Both Singla and Beauregard were friends with UW law student and Army Capt PERIOD Will Honea who was recently activated for duty in an unknown country PERIOD

Beauregard wants the resolution to start a discussion on the GPSS floor concerning the war against terrorism PERIOD

 said Beauregard PERIOD

While the resolution was not a planned effort between GPSS and the ASUW Beauregard plans to meet with Sam Castic the author of the ASUW resolution PERIOD Beauregard said that a potential meeting might possibly end in a joint endorsement PERIOD

According to Eric Stride ASUW liaison to the GPSS executive committee and cosponsor to the ASUW resolution Castic informed him of the resolution a little over a week ago PERIOD Beauregard started formulating his resolution when he heard about an ASUW resolution supporting American actions in Afghanistan two weeks ago PERIOD

Beauregard agreed the GPSS and Castics resolutions were similar but he would not say they were identical PERIOD

 said Beauregard PERIOD

Also passed in the committee meeting was a resolution strongly opposing the energy fee the Board of Regents imposed upon the student community for this academic year PERIOD

The resolution submitted by Jeremiah Stevens and GPSS President David Nixon 

Nixon also submitted a resolution opposing the  model UW president Richard McCormick supports to increase revenue for the UW PERIOD That model calls for hikes in tuition supplemented by hikes in financial aid to make up for a shortfall of higher education funds from the state Legislature PERIOD The resolution was tabled for review by the other executives PERIOD

The next GPSS general meeting is Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD in HUB 106B PERIOD
