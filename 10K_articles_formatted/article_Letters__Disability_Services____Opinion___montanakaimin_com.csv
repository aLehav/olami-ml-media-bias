I feel a responsibility to people with disabilities PERIOD I have ever since I became one of them in my early teens PERIOD

But Ive never felt shame because of my disability until my recent visit to Disability Student Services PERIOD As a student registered with the campus DSS I was genuinely excited PERIOD I envisioned walking into the office and being greeted with sensitivity and perhaps a bit of friendliness PERIOD Sadly this was not to be PERIOD Instead I was awkwardly glanced over by two seemingly confused and indifferent students PERIOD I asked the male one who was slumped over behind a desk in a swivel chair if I was in the right place PERIOD He scoffed a barely audible  From the start of this encounter I was uncomfortable PERIOD And disappointed PERIOD And reminded of another recent visit to DSS in which I witnessed a young female student in a wheelchair asking a girl at the front desk why she found it impossible to get to her classes PERIOD The girl behind the desk looked at the frustrated girl in the wheelchair with the same  expression I was evoking from these people PERIOD

Several questions became apparent after my visit to DSS.Who are the people working at Disability Student Services What makes them qualified to have this job Are they hired simply because they apply the same way janitors are hired at the University of Montana

The disability student minority of this campus is a unique population as it is in every location PERIOD They deserve a kinder acknowledgment than the experience I described PERIOD They deserve support and uplifting recognition from the moment they roll through the doors PERIOD
