In every election cycle womens reproductive rights are brought to the forefront and discussed as a public matter PERIOD No unpleasant detail is omitted PERIOD While not much can be done to take the debate away from the public eye and make it a private inhouse discussion there is much to be said about the problematic nature of the conversation itself PERIOD

The conversation revolves around the mother and the fetus PERIOD The1959Declaration of the Rights of the Child states The child needs appropriate legal protection before as well as after birth. yet according to the 1948Universal Declaration of Human Rightsthe right to choice and the right to privacy are inalienable rights PERIOD Furthermore the 1964Freedom of Choice Actdeclares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child terminate a pregnancy prior tofetal viabilityor terminate a pregnancy after viability when necessary to protect her life or her health. the question then arises do the rights of the fetus supersede those of the woman carrying it That is the abortion question. in the  caseRoe v PERIOD Wade the Supreme Court gave a landmark ruling legalizing abortion under the right to privacy PERIOD However the decision wasnt absolute  it allowed state regulation of abortion in the third trimester PERIOD The law stated that a womans right to privacy and her freedom of choice surpass the fetus right to life but only in the first two trimesters PERIOD

Personally I believe that as long as the fetus life is dependent on its mother the mother should decide its future as well as her own PERIOD Furthermore her choice must lie before the fetus viability period PERIOD After the 24thweek of pregnancythe fetushas the capability to survive outside of the mothers womb thanks to advances made in modern medicine PERIOD But before this phase the fetus survival is entirely contingent on the mother PERIOD The right to abort during this stretch should not be taken away PERIOD

Based on the precedent set by the law it is bizarre to see Republicans continuing the fight against abortion PERIOD If the Supreme Court explicitly said that the fetus shouldnt have individual rights exceeding those of its mother during vitality period why then do conservatives insist on fighting a womens right to privacy The answer is as plain as day sexism PERIOD

The bottom line is that by suggesting banning abortion prolife conservatives are imposing their ideas morals and values on women PERIOD Further the decision regarding an unborn childs life should be made by the person responsible for that life the mother PERIOD It is simply unfair forCongress  which is composed primarily of men  to rip that decision away from women by banning abortions as the Republicanmajority Congress wants to do PERIOD

Terminating a pregnancy is a personal and private choice that depends on multiple variables that exist in the carrier or mothers life the depth of which cannot be understood by an outsider PERIOD How can an outsider who lacks complete understanding even attempt to make decisions for the mother By mistaking abortion for a public and political matter prolife conservatives are simply undermining the importance of the mother in the process PERIOD Doesnt society owe that much respect and discretion to the concerned family The woman is as she should be in full control of her body and medical decisions PERIOD By waging war against Planned Parenthood the Republicans are putting women and society at risk PERIOD

On Dec PERIOD  of last year Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted If men were giving birth to babies there would not be a lot of discussion regarding the right to choose. if this were reality the public debate would cease PERIOD Hypothetically pregnant men might be able to fathom the complexity of the situation PERIOD

A pregnant mans right to choice would supersede everything PERIOD In that debate there would be no fetus and its right to life only the man and his right to choose PERIOD With an  percent majority of the seats in Congress men would be able to bury the conversation without a problem PERIOD Which raises the question do the prolifers actually even care about right to life Or is it just a faade under which they continue the archaic and outlived practice of controlling women
