A place where artists can supply their love and curious passersby can exercise their creative juices Wonder Fair has remained a place for the wildminded for over a decade PERIOD

For many Wonder Fair might just be where you get the special pens you like or this years bullet journal but a walk through the store showcases a wide selection of local and independent designs PERIOD

Its definitely comforting and very aesthetically pleasing said freshman Bridget Jones a patron of the store PERIOD I can find small artists work there and also support local business. serving the art community of Lawrence Wonder Fair was founded in  by University of Kansas Illustration and Visual Communication alumnus Eric Dobbins as an art galleryfor local Lawrence artists in the basement of The Burger Stand PERIOD Ownership passed to Meredith Moore and Paul DeGeorge in  as the store entered a new era PERIOD
