9675,2019-08-27,"ask most junior and senior students how they spent their time this summer and many will report that they spent a majority of it interning PERIOD According to Time more than  of the Class of  graduated with at least one internship on their resume PERIOD But how many students relocate to complete an internship  moving across the country or in some instances across the world for a temporary employment experience Though relocating for an internship is undoubtedly less common than completing an internship in general there is a mighty group of intrepid students that are that are willing to start not only a new job but start a new chapter of their lives in a city away from their hometowns PERIOD While students reasons for relocating are varied and multifaceted one idea unites many of their experiences they were offered an opportunity they couldnt acquire elsewhere PERIOD

For Isabel Holden  a member of Marists prestigious fashion design program there were an assortment of motives in deciding to move to Columbus Ohio this summer to partake in Abercrombie and Fitchs AF internship program PERIOD

My main reason for deciding to do an internship away from home was originally related to the benefits that Abercrombie and Fitch provides for their interns Holden who worked as an AF Womens Denim  Twill Design Intern explains PERIOD She also admits to always being one to push herself to seek out new opportunities  embracing the opportunity to explore different parts of the country and the world PERIOD Another huge factor is that Ive always been one to love and crave new experiences and change she says PERIOD

A former Freshman Florence Experience student Holden has garnered experience living both stateside and in Europe during her four years at Marist  she also participated in the Marist in Manhattan program her junior year PERIOD Holdens willingness to take a leap and live somewhere new ultimately contributed to her success at AF as she moved halfway across the country from her hometown in Hopkinton MA PERIOD When the opportunity came up for Columbus I had no idea what to expect but I was immediately interested PERIOD After hearing the proposal from the recruiter and about the company culture  I knew that I was going to go for it. rachel Godwin a Business Administration major graduating in Fall  echoes these sentiments PERIOD Godwin moved from Pittsfield MA to Menomonee Falls WI for an opportunity to work as a Merchandise Analyst Intern at Kohls for the summer PERIOD She reports that her favorite aspect of her internship experience was the people she met PERIOD

They made it easy to adjust everyone was so kind and welcoming Godwin says PERIOD It was also very rewarding to finish projects and gain experience doing what I want to be doing as a career PERIOD Kohls highly values their interns and applies a lot of our ideas to company strategies so it is cool to see them refer back to our projects when planning future assortments. godwin at Kohls PERIOD Courtesy of Rachel Godwin PERIOD

Godwins appreciation that she was allowed the opportunity to gain experience outside the classroom in the field she plans to enter is exactly what Kevin McCall the Coordinator of Outreach Marketing and Communications at Marist Colleges Center for Career Services states the mission of completing an internship is PERIOD

We encourage all Marist students to participate in experiential learning opportunities including internships throughout their college years McCall says PERIOD Internships allow students to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to a handson practical experience. experiential learning was precisely what Jay Silver a senior Political Science student acquired from his internship experience during Summer  PERIOD Silver moved from his Connecticut hometown to intern at the U.S PERIOD Small Business Administration SBA in Washington D.C PERIOD

My favorite part of working for the SBA was the fact that I got to work firsthand with issues revolving around the United States he says PERIOD While working in HR that summer I saw a lot of different projects and organizations going to fruition as well as having an understanding of how the government works inside and out PERIOD I also really enjoyed working first hand in a very fastpaced yet organized and responsible environment. silver in Washington D.C PERIOD Courtesy of Jay Silver PERIOD

Internship environments whether across the country from a students hometown or in their own backyard seem to dictate tremendously the worth of the internship experience PERIOD Kristina Rose Ultimo a senior fashion design student took the ultimate leap by moving across the Atlantic Ocean to intern in London England at Plus Samples PERIOD The opportunity left Ultimo with a collection of experiences living in an environment she couldnt have found in the U.S PERIOD While Ultimo had previously worked and lived in London during her time studying abroad during her junior year the experience of spending a summer in London was entirely new for Ultimo and one she couldnt pass up on PERIOD Her time interning in London even helped Ultimo decide that she wants to return to the U.K PERIOD for her Masters degree PERIOD

Life happens in the blink of an eye and time slips so easily through our fingertips she says PERIOD Any opportunity I get to travel especially when it can catapult my future career are opportunities that I am sure to take advantage of. after this summer internship experience I hope to work in London and pursue a Fashion Merchandising MA. ultimo at her internship in London England PERIOD Courtesy of Kristina Ultimo PERIOD

Though completing an internship in a students home city and working in a new city can have similar benefits there are some unique experiences that can only be experienced by relocating PERIOD Gaining an understanding of a new culture or way of life an increased sense of independence and opportunities for unparalleled growth have all been reported PERIOD

I was nervous going to the Midwest because I had never been before and didnt necessarily think of Ohio as anything fashionable or trend forward but after seeing Abercrombies campus and learning about the opportunity to work with the different creative outlets on campus I found that Columbus could provide me with another place to call home Holden says PERIOD Being in such an uncommon place for a fashion internship allowed me to learn and grow even further and take advantage of opportunities I wouldnt be able to elsewhere. godwin also reports that her internship in the Midwest allotted her educational opportunities that couldnt be found elsewhere PERIOD This ultimately was her reasoning to make the move to pursue something she couldnt find by staying in Pittsfield PERIOD

It was an opportunity to explore a new place and be introduced to what I want to be doing as a career at a great company it was a hard decision to make and a little scary but it was so worth it she says PERIOD

While these students ultimately do walk away satisfied with their summer experiences of course there is a learning curve and challenges PERIOD For Ultimo these included obstacles she had to face before even getting to her internship PERIOD The most difficult part of my experience was all the work that it took to get to London filling out the correct documents obtaining the visa finding accommodation booking the airfare and securing a sponsorship for the Visa Ultimo said PERIOD Her time at Plus Samples was ultimately worth these added stressors however PERIOD Ultimo got to attend Milano Unica a global textile convention something she couldnt have done interning back home in the U.S PERIOD

I was sent to Milan Italy to attend this conference on the companys behalf to network with textile mills from every corner of the globe and select the appropriate fabrics for Plus samples to potentially place orders of in the future she says PERIOD

Not everything about interning away from home is jetsetting business trips and exploring new cities there are growing pains associated with trading a summer at home for a summer in a city where a student potentially knows no one PERIOD

Working further away...it is a different challenge says Silver PERIOD You may not have the same comforts that you have working somewhere closer to that home state PERIOD The other difficult part was adapting to the new environment and new teammates PERIOD I had a lot of pressure on me as an intern to live up to the expectations of the organization of my school and of myself. godwin also admits she was originally apprehensive about moving halfway across the country to work at Kohls but is ultimately thrilled she did PERIOD

The most difficult thing was having to say goodbye to my loved ones and moving halfway across the country to a place I had never been to and didnt know anyone there already she says PERIOD  I was essentially starting over for  weeks but I wouldnt have changed a thing. despite coming from a myriad of different majors and academic disciplines a common thread unites all of these Marist students their appreciation for the sometimes struggles but overwhelmingly triumphs of relocating living on their own and succeeding in a place far from their hometown PERIOD

If you can experience both working close to home and far from home that is one of the most valuable things I believe you can do for your career Holden says PERIOD It shows employers that you are versatile and can adjust to new uncomfortable and unfamiliar situations. ultimo also believes relocating for an internship gives your resume  and understanding of where you want your career path to take you  a boost PERIOD Having an internship opportunity in a place you are not familiar with will give you insight into your future career path and industry especially if you are entering one with global roots she says PERIOD Pertaining to your career having an internship in a different city state or country gives you valuable talking points during an interview and makes you more knowledgeable about a different market and demographics. mcCall agrees PERIOD

Students who intern have an opportunity to learn about a company and an industry while developing skills that will be beneficial to them when they enter the workforce after they have completed their degree he says PERIOD Living on their own while interning will require the student to be more self sufficient expand their horizons and help them develop a more global mindset. as for advice for students grappling with the idea of relocating for an internship Godwin has an important piece of advice dont miss out on a learning experience just because you are afraid of trying something new PERIOD

The best piece of advice I received was If an opportunity doesnt terrify you then it is not worth taking. i received this advice days before receiving the offer to intern at Kohls so it was very fitting and I now know very true she says PERIOD
