Women are wildly unrepresented in the film industry  the Citizen Jane Film Festival aims to change that PERIOD

Founded at Stephens College in  Citizen Jane celebrates independent film by independent women through education connection and artisticunique experiences according to their website PERIOD Such experiences include a film series filmmaking camp and of course the internationallyknown film festival PERIOD

The Citizen Jane Film Festival is a major event for the city of Columbia and has grown larger each and every year PERIOD This year the event will take place Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Citizen Jane started out  years ago as a lecture series and digital filmmaking program planned largely in part by Stephens College students PERIOD It was also the students who came up with the name PERIOD

The next year Stephens College hosted the Fem Film Womens Symposium and the success of the femalecentered event sparked the idea of making Citizen Jane into a feminist film festival PERIOD

Ultimately in  the Citizen Jane Film Festival was born PERIOD It showcased films by female filmmakers and even attracted Academy Awardnominee Trouble the Water. the next year the festival returned and attendance spiked up  percent PERIOD Such an increase in attendance signified that Citizen Jane meant something to people and that it was not going anywhere PERIOD

The city of Columbia as well as filmmakers and festivalgoers from all over the world have continued to support Citizen Jane over the past  years PERIOD Well known directors producers and screenwriters have brought their films to the festival such as Christine Vachon and Lena Dunham PERIOD

From beginners to professionals Citizen Jane is the place for women filmmakers to be PERIOD The festival builds a community of female artists with a common goal no matter their experience level PERIOD

The festival shows femaledriven films holds panel discussions with filmmakers and hosts a summit that aims to spark discussion over ways to empower women in the film industry PERIOD Each event is femalecentered truly making the event what I would call a feminist film festival PERIOD

Citizen Jane is more than just a film festival PERIOD It is a movement that empowers and supports talented women who deserve equality and success in a maledominated field PERIOD Year by year Citizen Jane is bridging the gender equality gap in the film industry PERIOD
