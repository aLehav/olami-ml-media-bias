Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Keith HernandezMarch  

The Voice of Change ticket was disqualified from the  Student Association executive election Thursday due to three sanctions against the ticket PERIOD

The disqualification comes a day after the Standing for Every Student ticket called for the disqualification of the Voice of Change ticket citing alleged intimidation of voters disrupting an academic environment littering improper printing material and improper use of flier adhesiveUniversity Poster Policy PERIOD

The SA Board of Elections cited article VIII of the SA Bylaws as grounds for Voice of Changes suspension PERIOD The ticket is allowed to appeal its disqualification to the SA Supreme Court PERIOD

Raquel Chavez student trustee candidate on the Voice of Change ticket said the ticket will appeal the decision but denied further comment until the appeal has been reviewed and a decision has been made PERIOD

Ben Donovan presidential candidate for Standing for Every Student said his ticket has not faced any sanctions from the Board of Elections in regard to charges filed by the Voice of Change ticket Wednesday PERIOD Nathan Lupstein Voice of Change presidential candidate called for the disqualification of the Standing for Every Student ticket from the SA executive elections for allegedly working with the Northern Star to write negative articles against the Voice of Change campaign and intimidate the Board of Elections among other charges PERIOD

I think that it is unfortunate that  per the election commissioner and the Board of Elections  that they did break so many campaigning rules Donovan said PERIOD I do think that while that is unfortunate it is good that the election commissioner and the board are taking a stand on these violations. the Voice of Change petition was never officially filed because it was turned in to the Board of Elections three hours after the SA executive election closed Wednesday said Brandon Phillips Board of Elections chairman PERIOD Appeals to the Board of Elections must be turned in within two hours of the close of the elections Phillips said PERIOD
