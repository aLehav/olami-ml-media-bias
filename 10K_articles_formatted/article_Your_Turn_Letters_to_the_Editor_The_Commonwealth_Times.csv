As a professor of biology at VCU whose research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of evolutionary change from a mathematical perspective I felt it necessary to provide some perspective on the recent oped letter entitled Darwinism Philosophy not science. it is my opinion that Mr PERIOD Beldens sophomoric regurgitation of misinformation espoused by fringe groups is characteristic of a larger antiscience movement in contemporary American society PERIOD  My purpose here is not to begin a debate about the merits of evolutionary theory as we have over a century of sound scientific research that has continued to support this fundamental component of biology PERIOD  Rather I would like to explore two of the underlying themes in the original letter PERIOD

Lets begin by examining the use of the term Darwinism. it is amazing how much this word is thrown around in certain segments of society PERIOD  However in all the years I have been studying how evolution works I have never actually heard any biologist refer to themselves as Darwinists. this is not too surprising as we do not refer to physicists as Newtonians and I doubt Mr PERIOD Belden would call himself a Turinista. in fact you will only hear this term from people who do not understand evolutionary biology PERIOD  Lets make no mistake about it The term Darwinist is purely pejorative PERIOD  It has absolutely nothing to do with evolutionary theory and everything to do with demonizing those people. after all how many evolutionary biologists do you know

Perhaps we can find some more clues as to Mr PERIOD Beldens motivation by looking at the second sentence of his article that states evolution in and of itself does not infer anything about the existence or nonexistence of a creator. i fully agree with this statement and I have never seen any mention of a creator in any college text on evolutionary theory PERIOD  In fact if one was to go to the library and look up the number of times the term God or Creator was used in an article published by the journal Evolution as this is where these socalled Darwinists probably publish their stuff you will find a single reference in the  or so papers that are cataloged in the database since  and this paper is a perspective on the effects of Creation Sciences on the curricula of North American public schools PERIOD  Interesting PERIOD

So where are these Darwinists whose philosophy should be elevated to that of a religion  From the American Heritage Dictionary the term religion is defined as a Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe or b A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship PERIOD  Are there really people in the Richmond metropolitan area who think Charles Darwin possessed supernatural power or somehow was involved in the creation of the universe  It sure isnt any biologist that I have ever met PERIOD  So if the biologists arent the ones that see Charles Darwin as a deity and the study of evolution has nothing to do with the existence of a divine power then whom are we really talking about  Perhaps this is simply a canard and the issue goes beyond evolutionary biology PERIOD

The demonization of science in this country goes far beyond evolutionary biology reaching all branches of scientific inquiry PERIOD  When people use the derogatory terms Darwinism and Darwinist they are really referring to anyone who believes that the scientific method may lead to any conclusion that might contradict a literal interpretation of their particular religious text PERIOD  You dont have to go any further than last semesters seminar by Dr PERIOD Scott Walsh a member of the MCV faculty in the OBGYN department a bastion of evolutionary theory no doubt to see an excellent example of this PERIOD  Dr PERIOD Walsh a Young Earth Creationist included physicists mathematicians geologists chemists and biologists in his vitriolic characterization of Darwinism. lets close by examining Mr PERIOD Beldens obviously noncondescending statement Any American with a single openminded nerve cell in their brain will recognize that intelligent design as a scientific theory wields a great wealth of merit. ignoring the obvious anthropomorphizing of openmindedness to a single nerve cell you dont really believe that some of your nerve cells are more openminded than others do you this argument from incredulity has one of two possible motivations PERIOD  Either Mr PERIOD Belden has yet to learn what a scientific theory is or he is purposefully perpetuating the demonization of science PERIOD  You will have to decide for yourself which one is more likely but from the perspective of a professor here at VCU both are equally troubling PERIOD

I want to go ahead and speak for everyone who would prefer that we keep religion out of biology classes and textbooks PERIOD  I accept Chris Daniels offer made in a letter to the editor on Thursday to exclude the intelligent design hypothesis from the empirical science of biology PERIOD  As he said the theory of intelligent design is indeed a scientific one  but the scientific method applies only to empirical sciences not to historical sciences PERIOD  Empirical sciences like chemistry and biology look at how things function by nature and thus are repeatable and look only to naturalistic explanations PERIOD  Historical sciences like archaeology and forensic science look at particular past events and ask How did this arise allowing for both natural and intelligent causes and reconstructing rather than repeating the historical event

Although I seriously doubt that many forensic scientists would accept his classification of intelligent design as synonymous with their pursuits I do accept Daniels generous concession to scientific endeavor PERIOD  But that leaves us with another quandary Intelligent design needs a separate branch of science to fully study the historical beginnings and development of existence PERIOD  I wonder what kind of school would provide that class  Oh Ive got it  A seminary  Or maybe Liberty University is looking to expand its curriculum PERIOD

I could just leave it there but since Im on the subject let me point out the other inconsistencies of Daniels argument PERIOD  He claims that the world is irreducibly complex a motor doesnt appear out of thin air PERIOD  Hes right PERIOD  The knowledge that allows us to build internalcombustion engines evolved PERIOD  We have developed many skills and processes to build engines and it didnt happen in seven days PERIOD

His final point that DNA is a message from an intelligent designer was the dead giveaway that Daniels defense segued into an argument for religion particularly Christianity funny enough and not a sincere effort to expand the knowledge base of science PERIOD  It always comes back to the Trojan horse see Andrew Babbs editorial cartoon from Thursday PERIOD  DNA is a series of molecules that code for both functional and structural proteins from which we get organic compounds PERIOD  It is a chemical and biological process that developed over a long time like the motor but with a lot less human input PERIOD

Yet here we get to the leap that religionists will make every time PERIOD  In their anthropocentric worldview humankind is perfection made in the image of God PERIOD  So DNA has become Gods message writ in our very cells PERIOD  In the notsodistant past evidence of DNA would have been heresy PERIOD  Go figure. dNA is a physical structure that begets other physical structures PERIOD  It is only religion that insists it is a message from heaven PERIOD  This is exactly the imposition of a religious point of view on secular scientific study that should be excluded from serious debate or as Daniel suggested subjugated to its own academic pursuit PERIOD
