The University Apparel Manufacturing Committee once again took no action on the issue of public disclosure of URs manufacturing sites at a meeting Wednesday PERIOD

The committee had invited Barnes and Noble representative Joel Friedman to talk about the technicalities and practicality of releasing the information PERIOD

Friedman can disclose site locations if the university so chooses PERIOD

However he said trust between buyers and sellers  is more important than disclosure PERIOD

Full public disclosure is not going to solve the problem PERIOD The fundamental issue is of trust he said PERIOD

In the twohour questionandanswer session committee members asked Friedman about the disclosure policies of manufacturers the locations of factories with which Barnes and Noble suppliers work and the process of getting information about these factories PERIOD

Friedman said information about factories is already available on company Web sites PERIOD It would be hard to gather more details because companyfactory contracts are always changing PERIOD

Friedman said that disclosure is a more complicated issue than it seems PERIOD

I found the two hours with Joel Friedman very beneficial PERIOD His perspective was helpful in understanding issues of leverage licensing and sourcing said MaryBeth Cooper committee cochair and Dean of River Campus Students PERIOD Full public disclosure seems like a straightforward task to accomplish and quite frankly it didnt appear that way when I heard Mr PERIOD Friedman discuss it today. members of the NoSweat Coalition disagreed PERIOD

Dean Cooper made the absurd comment that requesting full public disclosure would be an impossible task. however it would be nothing more or less than a simple request junior and copresident of NoSweat Kirk Scirto said PERIOD Due to the administrators reluctance to vote nothing constructive occurred at the meeting although students and professors pushed for action on the disclosure issue. its not a very complicated issue said junior Sarah Clock nonvoting committee member and copresident of NoSweat PERIOD I was disappointed that committee members feel that we need to move to other issues and not forward this one. the last three committee meetings have yielded no decision PERIOD

Cooper said that the issue is a complex one and it had been paid due diligence by the committee PERIOD Bringing Friedman to talk was a positive step in that direction. she said PERIOD

Friedman asked what purpose a list of factories would provide and what the advantage of disclosing this information would be PERIOD

When asked what instead would be the reason for concealing this information Friedman said If there was a desire to hide information manufacturers wouldnt put it on a Web site. however Scirto said the information on the Web is inadequate PERIOD

The Web site lists that Friedman referred to are extremely limited not only because they are constantly changing and not updated often enough but mostly because they only contain a small list of factories out of the list of say all UR factories Scirto said PERIOD

Committee member and Director of Purchasing Quentin Roach pointed out the problem of who would bear the cost of obtaining the information  the company or the university PERIOD

He agreed with Friedman that the fundamental issue is trust PERIOD

Barnes and Noble already has disclosure  Theres a level of trust with Barnes and Nobles PERIOD Theyre doing their job Roach said at the meeting PERIOD

Clock said that the main issue wasnt the exact proposal but the idea behind it PERIOD She stressed the need for transparency and for consumers to be informed PERIOD

One more committee meeting remains this semester next Wednesday from  to  p.m PERIOD The location has not yet been decided PERIOD There is a possibility that the committee may vote on disclosure PERIOD  Meetings are open to the public PERIOD",Disclosure vote stalled - Campus Times,University of Rochester
