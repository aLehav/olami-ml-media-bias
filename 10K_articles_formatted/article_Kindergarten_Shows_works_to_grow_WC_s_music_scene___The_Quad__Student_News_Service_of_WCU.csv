9824,2023-11-05,"in the Foo Fighters ongoing documentary series on HBO Sonic Highways famous exNirvana drummer Dave Grohl and his crew of bandmates drive across the United States to explore what makes Americas music so special while recording their new album PERIOD So far theyve sang the blues in Chicago riffed hardcore punk in Washington D.C. and twanged country in Nashville PERIOD These separate music scenes are all so special in their own way but they all make up what makes our collective American music sensibilities so important PERIOD

Success always has to start somewhere PERIOD Every band has its origin and every artist has his or her roots PERIOD Even Nirvana owes a large bit of debt to their local music scene of Seattle the motherland of grunge PERIOD

West Chester Pennsylvania is no different PERIOD There is a thriving music scene right under our noses just waiting to explode PERIOD Its close location to Philadelphia creates great opportunities for young bands to start up and find success of their own PERIOD I recently sat down with Mitch Koehler and Kenny Miller two individuals who are working to improve the scene along with others by creating Kindergarten Shows a collective that is booking a variety of different shows and opportunities for bands in the West ChesterPhiladelphia area PERIOD Their most recent event featured the bands Casual Ratburn Pocket and UncleFather Oscar at Fennarios on October  PERIOD

Like most of my ideas I made a stupid joke PERIOD And then I think about it until its finally a reality said Koehler regarding the formation of Kindergarten Shows PERIOD He then went to Miller who he had known for many years because both of them have been playing in the area for many years PERIOD We have always seen eye to eye when it comes to building an inclusive music scene in town said Miller about their idea PERIOD

Koehler  grew up in Bensalem Pennsylvania and is currently a student at WCU where he has been living rich for about a year PERIOD He currently plays bass in the band Scuzbot who have been together for about  years PERIOD Scuzbot who plays gritty guitarslaying punk rock have released one record and are getting ready to release another that they have just finished recording PERIOD Koehler said it will be out by mid . he also plans on releasing music with Andrew Huston PERIOD

Miller  is originally from Doylestown Pennsylvania and has been playing music since he was  years old PERIOD He plays in multiple bands Brokehead Spumoni and Piranha but also releases music under the names Between Days and Glenn Matthews PERIOD

Regarding the state of the West Chester local music scene Koehler said It doesnt get enough credit. venues such as Fennarios up on Church Street and the West Chester VFW located near Paoli Pike offer great locations to see local or touring bands in the area that Kindergarten Shows has booked PERIOD My Parents House The Note and The New Button all came and went but I hope Kindergarten Shows can serve the same purpose he said PERIOD

I think that in some cases having a lack of venues can dampen a music scene but in West Chester I dont think thats the case said Miller PERIOD West Chester has music lovers within the town limits they just dont always know that the music is happening PERIOD Before you even know its there a great spot like My Parents House disappears and you missed out. this community of music is part of what makes Kindergarten Shows so special individuals going out of their way to bring music to the people in any way possible PERIOD

I think that the strength of community lies within the people that it consists of not the nostalgic value it holds or the personal ambitions of individuals that contribute to it temporarily PERIOD At the same time Im entirely conflicted by those strong feelings of nostalgia and ambition outside of West Chester said Miller PERIOD Its what makes a local music scene such a delicate community effort. also bars such as The Social Lounge and Landmark offer open mic nights and jams for a more diverse audience PERIOD

West Chesters close location to Philadelphia also offers great opportunities for bands attempting to get a name out there PERIOD However what people do not know is how important West Chesters scene is to Philadelphia as well PERIOD Philadelphia has a lot going on but West Chester is a cleaner more secluded town said Koehler PERIOD I feel a little closer to the town because Scuzbot has been playing a lot of the Philly house shows but Im a fan of the suburbs. there are lots of great bands from West Chester that play out in Philadelphia said Miller PERIOD One of my goals is to make that relationship reciprocal Koehler said PERIOD

West Chester has everything that is necessary for a music scene to thrive the people the places the environment and the music PERIOD I think people appreciate what were doing as far as live music goes said Koehler PERIOD All it takes is a group of people in the area who want to find that community of music and carve West Chester into the greater American musical history PERIOD

Some upcoming events Kindergarten Shows wants locals to know about are as follows Nov PERIOD  at the Golden Tea House in Philadelphia with Scuzbot Mike Bell Danger Os Lures and Spumoni and Nov PERIOD  at the West Chester VFW featuring Good Times Steel Nation and many others PERIOD

If you are a band looking to be booked by Kindergarten Shows send an email to kindergartenshowsgmail.com or glenn.maphewsgmail.com PERIOD You can find them on Facebook as well along with information and the music of the various bands that will be playing at the shows such as Scuzbot and Brokehead PERIOD Even if you dont play in a band and just want to help out the scene get in touch with them for upcoming shows and spreading the word PERIOD

Some advice that the guys from Kindergarten Shows offered individuals trying to get started in the West Chester music scene If you cant put your instrument down and all you hear is music in your head then run with it and do what makes you happy said Miller PERIOD Koehler said Anyone can start a band really PERIOD Bands only get better as they perform. by going out and supporting your local music scene one can find more than just new exciting music PERIOD I felt included by strangers who had no obligation to include me which was a new feeling for me said Miller PERIOD I was inspired by that. there are only so many of us keeping the torch alive said Koehler PERIOD Either way things are picking up PERIOD As long as shows happen every month it keeps the fun around the college and West Chester in general. tyler Asay is a thirdyear student majoring in communication studies PERIOD He can be reached at TA791988wcupa.edu PERIOD
