California Gov PERIOD Arnold Schwarzenegger will soon decide if he will grant clemency for crime lord turned antigang activist Stanley Tookie Williams who is scheduled to be executed on Dec PERIOD thirteenth for the murders of four people  years ago PERIOD Many of Schwarzeneggers most liberal supporters have demanded that he show mercy and commute his sentence to life in prison PERIOD But before mainstream liberals start pressing the Governor we need to analyze all of the facts PERIOD

First of all Williams was convicted by a jury that was composed of  whites and not a single black PERIOD The key witnesses for the prosecution were criminals that testified against him in exchange for leniency in their trials PERIOD Furthermore the only physical evidence found against Williams was a shotgun shell casing that might have been fired from a gun that Williams purchased five years before the murders PERIOD

While in prison Williams has transformed into a crusader against gang violence writing nine childrens books denouncing violence and gangs PERIOD He also helped negotiate a peace treaty between the Crips  the gang he founded  and the Bloods the Crips longtime rival PERIOD

As a black man and a Democrat who believes that the criminal justice system is the most racist institution in American society I obviously must support clemency for Williams right Wrong PERIOD Despite the facts that show grounds for clemency Schwarzenegger should do the right thing and not intervene PERIOD

The fact remains that Williams was convicted of ruthlessly killing four people and he must now pay the price PERIOD It is true that most of the witnesses used against him were indeed criminals PERIOD But that merely reflects the fact that most of the people he associated with were criminals PERIOD Also many of the witnesses testified that Williams bragged to them about committing the murders and those present during the killings testified that Williams was the shooter PERIOD It is hard to imagine that multiple witnesses all concocted the same story without any factual basis PERIOD



In any event it is not Schwarzeneggers job to determine if Williams is guilty PERIOD A jury found Williams guilty and the ruling has been consistently upheld by judges on the state and federal level PERIOD What Schwarzenegger must decide is whether Williams deserves to be shown mercy PERIOD

I believe that Williams good deeds should be commended PERIOD His books may have actually spared thousands of young children from following the path that he took PERIOD However the Crips continue to kill and recruit kids to join their world of drugs and violence PERIOD Many of the administrators of San Quentin State Prison where Williams is being held believe that Williams transformation is a charade and that he still runs the Crips from death row PERIOD And as the founder of the Crips Williams is at least partly responsible for the deaths of hundreds  maybe even thousands  of young black men who were slain by gang members as well as for the drug trade that has destroyed so many black communities in Los Angeles PERIOD

Although many liberals have tried to make this a case of discrimination against blacks this is not a racial issue PERIOD The truth is every black person should be ashamed of heartless criminals like Williams and liberals should be ashamed that so many of them are coming to his defense PERIOD

The time has come for justice PERIOD We must remember Albert Owens a young father of two that pleaded for his life before he was shot twice in the back by Mr PERIOD Williams PERIOD We also need to remember the Yang family the Taiwanese immigrants who left their homeland for a country that promised liberty and justice for all only to be killed when Williams robbed their motel for  PERIOD Schwarzenegger must make good on the promise and make sure that justice is served PERIOD Williams showed no mercy to the individuals he brutally executed PERIOD I see no reason why he should receive mercy now PERIOD
