Observing teammates his freshman year Terez Hall remembers seeing a young Terry Beckner Jr PERIOD take the field against Mississippi State before their matchup in Columbia PERIOD

We were watching him on the field Hall said PERIOD He looked like the chubbiest crap man. three years later Beckners physical profile doesnt quite fit that confusing description anymore PERIOD

Sitting across a hotel suite in his sportcoat at the SEC Media Days in Atlanta Hall couldnt help but notice PERIOD

You look at him now over there in the sportcoat and hes looking swole Hall said PERIOD Every time you see Terry hell take that jacket off PERIOD Hes looking like Dave Bautista he got a whole lot stronger PERIOD Hell be trying to flex in the locker room like hes got abs. beckner was able to lose six percent of his body fat while gaining nine pounds of muscle during his first fully healthy offseason PERIOD

But the change for Beckner hasnt just been physical PERIOD The standout of Missouris defensive line has undergone a complete transformation since joining the Tigers as a fivestar recruit from East St PERIOD Louis Illinois PERIOD

Beckner had a strong freshman year and earned Freshman AllAmerican and Freshman AllSEC team honors despite his season being cut short by a torn ACL and MCL in week  versus BYU PERIOD

Then came the suspension PERIOD That January Beckner was pulled over and later arrested under a misdemeanor for possession of marijuana PERIOD He was suspended indefinitely by the team before returning for his sophomore season PERIOD

Beckner recalled struggling with the freedom of college life at the beginning of his career due to his upbringing PERIOD

Adjusting to college was a little bit harder because youre on your own Beckner said PERIOD You dont have your parents or people to nag you and tell you that you need to do something or that you need to act a certain way. after returning to the team Beckner has not only shaken any disciplinary problems but he has become the leader both physically and mentally for the defensive unit PERIOD

During his freshman and sophomore seasons the idea of Beckner representing the team at media days would have been unexpected to everyone following or involved with the team including quarterback Drew Lock PERIOD

Terry wasnt a bad person when he got here  Lock said PERIOD But just the strides he made is what amazed everyone in the locker room PERIOD Terry is one in a million. but fate intervened Beckners sophomore season when another seasonending knee injury struck this one in week seven against Middle Tennessee State PERIOD It was another season that ended with a long road of rehab for Beckner but he was already thinking of what it would take to get back to full strength PERIOD

I was just thinking Ive got another nine months of hard labor  rehab rehab rehab  and youre going to be straight Beckner said PERIOD I dont like being down PERIOD Something like that can break you down mentally but I didnt want to let that happen to me so I just had to get back on my feet. beckner returned to the team again his junior season but he and the defense got off to a slow start PERIOD Beckner displayed the growth of his leadership in a meeting with Barry Odom marching into his coachs office and proclaiming that no matter what he was going to return for his senior season PERIOD

The decision was a simple one for Beckner PERIOD He decided he couldnt leave his teammates PERIOD

It was an easy decision Beckner said PERIOD Because I know I wasnt ready to leave that year PERIOD Really it was just coming back for my brothers one last time and getting my degree. but that changed in the second half of the season PERIOD Beckner started to gain confidence and started to come on strong according to Hall PERIOD

Later in the season Terry was popping up everywhere Hall said PERIOD In the UCONN game he almost got a pick had a couple tackles for losses and you can tell he was moving around a whole lot faster PERIOD And hed got energy now PERIOD He was dropping celebrations and he just felt a whole lot better. getting Beckner back to full strength was key for the defense to vastly improve its play in the back half of the season PERIOD Hall said Beckners play forced opponents to double team him which opened up the rest of the defense PERIOD

He helps us play better Hall said PERIOD Playing behind him we rally around him PERIOD We all feed off each others momentum and he takes two blockers to help me get a tackle or to help Cale Garrett get a tackle or Brandon Lee get a tackle PERIOD He takes two blockers to help the other lineman get a oneonone PERIOD Terry also holds everyone accountable. the transformation of Beckner positioned him to be a leader this season for Missouri but that doesnt mean its over yet PERIOD Beckners charge is to prove an unproven defense PERIOD
