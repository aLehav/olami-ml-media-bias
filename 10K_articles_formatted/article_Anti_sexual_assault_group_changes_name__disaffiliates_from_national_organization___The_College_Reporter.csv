The organization formerly known as  in  a mens group dedicated to preventing sexual assault on campus has changed its name to Men United Against Sexual Assault MUASA PERIOD

According to Mike DiAntonio  president of MUASA the name was changed because it referenced a negative statistic while the group was trying to spread a positivemessage PERIOD

Before the name was  in  which was an old statistic from the last few years that  in  collegeaged women will be a victim of sexual assault or rape DiAntonio said PERIOD We were looking to change the name to something that was easy to say didnt bear any negative or condemning connotation and promoted the sense that the men in the group were unified in their efforts against sexual assault. by transitioning to a new name MUASA is also becoming independent from the national organization of  in  with which they were previously affiliated PERIOD

We wanted to refocus our efforts and we wanted to be independent so we werent tied to a national organization that controlled the way we gave presentations controlled the way we communicated with the campus said Mark T PERIOD HarmonVaught  vicepresident of MUASA PERIOD Our visions are a little different although our goals are the same the way we want to get there is a little bit different. diAntonio explained how the national organization did not provide the group with substantial support PERIOD

Normally with a national chapter you get different benefits different notices different alumni involvement and  in  national had been falling off as of late DiAntonio said PERIOD It was not contributing much to our cause and in ways it was detracting PERIOD We felt that we had altered the program enough and what we were trying to do was different enough from what nationals was doing so we thought it would be better just to brand it ourselves. the group had been researching sexual assault and communication with the school administration without the help of the national organization PERIOD In addition they felt the national program was not tailored to a small campus like FM PERIOD

The program before was tailored to a very nonspecific college or university you could give the same program to Arizona State which is thousands of people or give it to a college that is even smaller than us DiAntonio said PERIOD This did not address the more personalized needs we have on a small campus. diAntonio pointed to specific factors such as the possibility of seeing the same people every day that differentiate a small campus when it comes to sexual assault and noted the importance of addressing these needs PERIOD

HarmonVaught emphasized that while the group has broken off from its national affiliation they will continue the same work they have been doing all along PERIOD

We have already been doing what we are going to do HarmonVaught said PERIOD We hope to do it better we hope to do it more work more with the campus and hold more events but ultimately our focus hasnt changed PERIOD Now we can identify ourselves in whichever way we chose and we dont have to align ourselves with any ideological beliefs with which we are not closely affiliated. according to both DiAntonio and HarmonVaught the mission of MUASA is to create a support system for those affected by sexual assault and educate men to be active in the prevention of sexual assault as well PERIOD

Our goal is to affect change to the campus culture surrounding rape and sexual assault HarmonVaught said PERIOD That means providing for support of survivors of sexual assault but also on the other end of that equation encouraging men to be active bystanders when they see things to act. diAntonio noted that MUASA has had very productive conversation with many groups on campus PERIOD

We make presentations to fraternities sports teams different college houses and we are actually moving towards doing the sexual assault presentations for orientation as well DiAntonio said PERIOD

Upcoming events for MUASA include their annual poker tournament in April PERIOD In addition they plan to have a presence at Spring Arts next weekend PERIOD
