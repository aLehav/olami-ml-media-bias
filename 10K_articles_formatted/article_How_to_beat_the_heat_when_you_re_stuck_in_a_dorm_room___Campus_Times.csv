A lot of people complain about Rochesters winters but in my opinion the summer months are far worse PERIOD When it gets cold even polar vortex cold you can always put on more layers PERIOD In the winter heavy coats long underwear ski masks or even goggles can become necessities outside the tunnels PERIOD When it gets hot your only refuge is an airconditioned building PERIOD Those tunnels are cooled in the summer along with most academic buildings but many dorms are not PERIOD The situation is especially bad for firstyears who only have one airconditioned dorm available PERIOD It gets better as more dorms become available sophomore and junior year but if you dont want to shell out for Riverview or OBrien your options are limited PERIOD Fans can help but they mostly just move around uncomfortably warm wet air without cooling it down from August to late October PERIOD To have much noticeable effect on the air they have to be loud which can create conflict with your roommate if they like the noise even less than the heat PERIOD Fortunately there are a few ways to adapt if you live somewhere without central air PERIOD

This might sound satirical but the first thing you can do is give up sleeping in the dorms PERIOD The air cools down at night but the humidity gets worse to compensate which makes trying to sleep the worst part of not having AC PERIOD This can come as a bit of a culture shock if youve always had AC and just assumed that it got more comfortable outside at night PERIOD It seems crazy at first but there are plenty of buildings that are both cool and unlocked overnight with plenty of empty couches PERIOD Ive personally spent nights in Rettner and Rush Rhees when I knew the night would be especially hot and humid PERIOD The janitors probably know that students sleep there regularly when theyre studying so nobody bothered me PERIOD It was much more comfortable than sleeping with a blanket only to wake up in a pool of sweat PERIOD

For offcampus residents another way to adapt is to buy a personal air conditioner offseason PERIOD A good one right now will probably cost you north of  because demand for ACs is way higher when its hot PERIOD I bought one in January right before we got a foot of snow and subzero temperatures saving me  PERIOD If you cant afford to buy a personal air conditioner cold water can be the next best thing PERIOD Its a good idea to buy a small fridge in the first place and a water filter like a Brita will hold a lot of water and make it taste a lot better than from the tap PERIOD

Of course the main issue is that the school hasnt made the best decisions on this problem PERIOD It heats all the dorms in the winter perfectly fine as far as I can tell PERIOD This is despite the fact that its more expensive than cooling them  an 80degree temperature difference is much harder to correct than one of  degrees PERIOD Even without refitting the dorms shifting the school year would help a lot PERIOD The dorms are much more comfortable when classes end in May than when they start in August PERIOD If classes started in September and ended in June at least a few weeks of uncomfortable dorm living could be avoided for the cost of shifting schedules around PERIOD Either way the school should treat the problem as a real issue to be fixed and not just an inevitable reality for unlucky firstyears PERIOD",How to beat the heat when youâ€™re stuck in a dorm room - Campus Times,University of Rochester
