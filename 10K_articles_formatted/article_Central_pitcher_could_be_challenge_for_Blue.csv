With three of the top eight hitters in the Big Ten and the third highest batting average in the conference the Michigan softball team does not get flustered at the plate too often PERIOD But last March Central Michigan hurler Wendy Stephens did just that PERIOD

In just her second start of the season Stephens baffled the Wolverines all afternoon using her three different changeups to allow just three hits PERIOD Michigans only run came off of a twoout single by Monica Schock and the Wolverines needed a twohit shutout masterpiece by Marissa Young to win  PERIOD

Michigan  Big Ten  will face Stephens again today when it travels to Mount Pleasant for a doubleheader against the Chippewas  PERIOD

She really throws us off and gives us a hard time said second baseman Kelsey Kollen who was one of  finalists named this week for the inaugural USA Softball Player of the Year award PERIOD So we need to make a better game plan better than the last one as far as our approach as to how to hit her. despite Michigans storied softball history it holds just a  advantage in its series history with the Chippewas PERIOD Thats after beating them in March and sweeping them in a doubleheader last year PERIOD Central Michigan currently has a gameandahalf lead in the MidAmerican Conference Western Division and has won eight of its last nine games PERIOD The Chippewas along with Ball State are one of two teams that have been named as one of the top  teams in the Mideast region as part of the NCAAs biweekly poll PERIOD

So even with a huge fourgame weekend with two games against Minnesota and Wisconsin on the horizon a letdown that might be expected in a middle of the week game such as todays contests is unlikely PERIOD

Tomorrows game will be easier to get up for than some of the weaker opponents in the Big Ten teams that we know of Kollen said PERIOD

Facing Stephens again will be a good challenge for the Wolverines as they have been working on becoming more aggressive at the plate PERIOD Too often this season Michigan hitters have let good pitches go by early in the count and thus have been forced to swing at questionable pitches with two strikes PERIOD Such problems got Michigan into trouble two weeks ago against Penn State when it left eight runners on base en route to a  loss and last weekend against Indiana when it did not get a hit until the fifth inning PERIOD In practice this week coach Carol Hutchins has talked about tactics like hitting one of the first three pitches or taking the first pitch and then being aggressive PERIOD

We get too picky and too selective and we fall behind 0andthe count Kollen said PERIOD We have to swing at anything close as opposed to hitting something that we want to hit. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
