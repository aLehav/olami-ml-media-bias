Dawn Lammey that is PERIOD

Head coach Char Morett said of the victory 

Probably not PERIOD The No PERIOD  Lions  owned Temple from the word go completely controlling the offensive zone and allowing minimal Owl encroachment to the Lion end of the field limiting Temple to only four shots PERIOD

The Lions came out firing but despite an initial flurry of shots and penalty corner attempts they could not connect ball to net PERIOD However Penn State continued to pressure the Temple defense which soon resembled a person trying to plug a dam with a finger PERIOD Sooner or later it was going to burst PERIOD
