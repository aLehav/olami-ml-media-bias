Every football season teams are going to have injured players PERIOD Some injuries could end the players season while others are not as terrible PERIOD

This season has tested the depth chart and character of head coach Bob Stoops football team PERIOD

As it stands now four key players for the Sooners are out with injuries three of those four are season ending injuries PERIOD

The injured players have played significant minutes for the Sooners already this season and raise questions about the team going forward PERIOD

Senior fullback Trey Millard has been holding down the offensive side of the ball this season and will be missed going forward after tearing his ACL PERIOD Millard has done it all for the Sooners  blocking catching and running the ball PERIOD

Opposite of Millard senior linebacker Corey Nelson will miss the rest of the season because of a strained pectoral muscle he received against TCU PERIOD Sophomore linebacker Frank Shannon was knocked out of the Texas Tech game and will most likely return but that left a lot of the pressure on a pair of true freshmen PERIOD

The freshmen have been the silver lining in the whole situation PERIOD In the absence of all these marquee players freshmen have stepped up and helped the Sooners improve to  as a team PERIOD

Most notably freshmen have made the biggest impact as linebackers PERIOD Dominique Alexander is filling in for Nelson and has done a solid job thus far and after Shannon left the game against Tech another freshman stepped up PERIOD

Linebacker Jordan Evans had himself an excellent game filling in for Shannon PERIOD Evans recorded eight tackles and one pass breakup PERIOD

And right now OU could use help at the defensive tackle position too PERIOD

Sophomore Jordan Phillips is missing the rest of the season to repair a chronic back injury PERIOD The Sooners will use multiple players to replace Phillips but mostly redshirt freshman Jordan Wade who recorded eleven tackles and one sack already this year PERIOD

It is easy to say injuries have hindered the Sooners this year PERIOD

Theres no question that OU struggled stopping the run against Texas and that played an integral part in the loss but so far OU is starting to pick up the pieces and build a contender PERIOD

The degree to which younger players have stepped up is impressive and Stoops has to be pleased with that PERIOD However one more injury like the one Millard came down with last Saturday and the season could potentially be a disaster PERIOD
