Travel and study abroad seem more important now than ever PERIOD With trouble breaking out all over the world the current generation of students needs to understand what makes anger explode into hatred and violence PERIOD But few would sign up for a tour of the Paris suburbs this week PERIOD That is of course unless they dont mind the smell of smoke PERIOD

For the past two weeks French citizens have been torching their towns with hostile aggression PERIOD With  singed cities  tired police officers and  charred vehicles so far French and other people around the globe wonder exactly what started this in the first place PERIOD

These riots caused by ongoing frustration in impoverished immigrant areas where few can find jobs recall all too well other famous peasant revolts from the past PERIOD Try to recall PowerPoints from that Themes in Modern World History class you slept through PERIOD Masses of people living in the neglectful shadows of their societies often grow tired of their conditions and rebel using whatever means available PERIOD

Sound familiar

It should if for no other reasons than because of the multiple similarities to life in modern day Paris PERIOD

The regions poor people especially religious minorities feel wrongly ignored by their government and have grown tired of knocking on locked doors PERIOD The current unrest echoes tense struggles from the past  economic religious and governmental PERIOD

History overflows with tales of underdogs erupting in social coups often with the same Were not going to take this mentality we see in French cities today PERIOD France is more than familiar with the social uprisings and we Americans can boast of a few healthy riots of our own PERIOD

This summer marked the fortieth anniversary of the infamous Watts riots a sixday public revolt in August  resulting in  deaths and over  ruined buildings in Los Angeles PERIOD In less than one week the substandard streets and businesses of Watts Calif. were so besieged that they required a National Guard barricade of the region PERIOD

Right now the French rioters consist of exasperated members of immigrant communities just outside Paris mostly disaffected Muslim youths who feel they are not accepted or respected in France PERIOD With people suffering from high unemployment rates scanty attention from government and blatant racism even ordinary occurrences can trigger uncontrolled emotions PERIOD

Discrimination not just racial but ethnic as well seems to be a theme that underlies many of the problems in the banlieue wrote Dr PERIOD Seth Whidden assistant professor of French at Villanova PERIOD Its too simple to say that the problem is racist but there are enormous inequalities in French society that also break down rather neatly along racial and ethnic lines. maybe the times arent changing as much as they should PERIOD Paris suburbs and Watts bear stinging similarities in their uncontrollable insurgencies suggesting that societies need to follow through on promises of social reform PERIOD Both in Los Angeles and in Paris people rise up without leaders specific goals or game plans PERIOD

At first glance the French rioters might appear to be the scum French Interior Minister  Nicolas Sarkozy described them to be PERIOD But conscientious onlookers say such derision is a prime example of the administrative alienation and abuse that caused such incensed detachment in the first place PERIOD

Separating the lower classes and underprivileged members of society from the rest of their fellow citizens is incredibly alienating and it has happened all over big cities of the world including in the United States Dr PERIOD Whidden wrote PERIOD Think of South Central L.A PERIOD Providing inadequate social services to those areas and letting the highrises become deathtraps is inexcusable and only aggravates the situation. the background story is a common one  people can neither advance in their social confines nor attract assistance from those above them PERIOD Combine that frustration with a group ready to stand on whatever stage produces publicity and you have yourself the makings of an urban riot PERIOD

Some of todays erupting French towns have unemployment rates of up to  percent even higher in a few places PERIOD In predominantly Muslim neighborhoods some organizations take advantage of youthful sentiments of alienation from state and redirect what might be feelings of patriotism into religious fervor PERIOD When government officials either overlook or offend this spiritual rerouting they can unwittingly encourage antiadministration insurgency PERIOD

Sure sounds a lot like Watts circa  only with a different minority group PERIOD No one saw the unprovoked uprising coming then either not Watts residents and certainly not state officials PERIOD

The turbulent week of the Watts riots sent administrative heads spinning in Los Angeles producing new ideas about civic obligation PERIOD Aid packages and housing reform goals to repair the damage were proposed PERIOD However  years later little has changed in Watts PERIOD

France quickly jumped on the financial assistance bandwagon with talks of funneling funds into the local education and employment PERIOD

While strengthening those two focuses might improve living conditions outside Paris experts say attitudes and social behavior toward the disaffected must turn also around to avoid future tensions PERIOD

The big question of course is what next Dr PERIOD Whidden wrote PERIOD The violence will die down if the French government meets the challenge as it has the potential to do capably with concrete solutions to improve living and working conditions and also with compassion. at the fortieth anniversary ceremony held in Los Angeles earlier this year LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa voiced his regret that little has been done to improve the Watts of  PERIOD In too many ways the city remains unchanged PERIOD

It may be too early for France to know what steps to take to solve the problems that caused these riots PERIOD However few believe it makes sense to wait four decades to make amends PERIOD
