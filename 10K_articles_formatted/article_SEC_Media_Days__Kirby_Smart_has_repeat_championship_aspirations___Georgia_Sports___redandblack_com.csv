Wednesday continued this years SEC Media Days a fourday event hosted in Atlanta PERIOD The event features a number of SEC football coaches and athletes including Georgias own head coach Kirby Smart Stetson Bennett and Nolan Smith PERIOD

Smart opened his remarks by giving a shout out to the fiftieth anniversary of Title IX and referencing his wife and daughter who are athletes PERIOD He also discussed the excitement that he and his players have for the ChickFilA kickoff game on Sept PERIOD  against Oregon coached by his longtime friend and former assistant Dan Lanning PERIOD

Smart built the Georgia football program as it stands today with the hopes of it becoming a dynasty in the SEC for a long time PERIOD This culminated last season with the Bulldogs winning the  National Championship PERIOD

According to Smart last season began with a singular quote from Henry David Thoreau Success comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it. however this quote will continue to roll with the team this year and for years to come as it is embedded in the football culture for the Bulldogs PERIOD

Last seasons title run provided a learning opportunity for Georgia to use going forward navigating time management PERIOD The team worked harder in  as compared to previous years where they fell short of the gold PERIOD

In the previous Playoff we had we didnt practice as many days in pads we didnt condition as much as we did in this one Smart said PERIOD We felt like that was a very integral part to our team PERIOD Could we be the best conditioned team when we played Michigan when we played Alabama That was something that we really honed in on and thought was important. players buying into that extra work was important to leading Georgia over the championship hump after  long years PERIOD

Going into next season Smart is not concerned with complacency setting in on his players following their championship win PERIOD

To be complacent you have to have done something and achieved something Smart said PERIOD The men on this team for this season have not done that PERIOD We had  players that have now gone to NFL camps or draft picks PERIOD Theyre gone PERIOD We have some returning players but theyre hungry as ever. speaking of hunger Smart cited that as the identity of the team heading into fall camp PERIOD

A lot of guys want to prove that they can replace the other guy Smart said PERIOD They dont want to be the other guy they want to be the next guy PERIOD You look across the board we had some highprofile players on defense and offense when you count the backs and receivers that we have to replace those guys PERIOD The hunger comes from the opportunity the talented players behind them have. examples of this hunger to succeed both individually and as a collective are shown in how the team has studied the fall of various organizations PERIOD

Our guys have asked questions and weve done a lot of studies on how the mighty have fallen Smart said PERIOD We have skull sessions 15minute meetings 20minute meetings and breakout groups PERIOD We talk about how the mighty have fallen PERIOD Im talking about in business sports history .. PERIOD You learn from the mistakes of others. while Thoreaus quote rings in the minds of their players from last season another quote also is now being instilled into the Georgia football culture PERIOD

Can we have one plus one equals threeFor us one plus one equals three means we get more together than we do apart. while most championship teams are the hunted after reaching the top of the mountain Smart said the Bulldogs look forward to being the hunters instead as they are not going to sit back and be passive in their quest to repeat as champions PERIOD
