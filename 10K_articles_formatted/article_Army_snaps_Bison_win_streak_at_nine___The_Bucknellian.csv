The mens basketball team entered its contest on Saturday at Army on a ninegame winning streak but it was the Black Knights who looked like the streaking team scoring  points en route to a 20point victory over the Orange and Blue PERIOD The defeat was only the second for the Bison sinceDecember and it ended their quest for a perfect season in the Patriot League PERIOD

The Black Knights fired right out of the gates showing the firstplace undefeated Bison that they had come to play PERIOD Tied at  eight minutes into the game Army went on a  run for an 11point lead one the Orange and Blue would challenge but never overcome PERIOD

Army went into the locker room at the intermission with an eightpoint advantage having shot over  percent from the field PERIOD

Army came out the gate shooting very well from three G.W PERIOD Boon  said.They also made a lot of hustle plays that we are accustomed to making and that was the difference in the game. in the second half the Bison traded baskets with the Black Knights keeping the game close until the 10minute mark PERIOD Army proved to be too much for the Orange and Blue pulling away late for the  victory PERIOD

They shot very well from the perimeter and were able to get these open looks in transition and from dribble penetration said Mike Muscala  the leading scorer and rebounder for the Bison this season. we werent making the right defensive rotations which left them a lot of open shots and when they did miss we didnt do a good job of getting rebounds. they played with more intensity than us from start to finish. muscala controlled the paint on both ends of the floor for the Orange and Blue PERIOD On the offensive side he tallied  points despite drawing many double and tripleteams from the Black Knights PERIOD

Defensively Muscala grabbed nine rebounds and recorded three blocked shots PERIOD His presence underneath the basket forced Army to shoot from the perimeter which proved to be the difference in the contest PERIOD

Cameron Ayers  registered  points while Bryan Cohen  and Joe Willman  scored  each but these individual performances were not enough to overcome Armys potent attack from threepoint range PERIOD

In almost every Patriot League game that we had played up until the Army game we were able to get off to a good start and if the shots werent dropping we were able to get defensive stops Muscala said. every time we got something going for us on offense against Army they answered on the other end which we could never overcome. the Bison entered the Army game having won  of their previous  contests including dramatic victories over Richmond one of the nations best teams and rival Holy Cross thanks to lastsecond baskets by Muscala PERIOD The ninegame winning streak the Bison took into the contest versus Army had been the fifthlongest in the country PERIOD

The Orange and Blue begin the second round of Patriot League play Saturday night at home versus a Navy team they beat by seven earlier this season PERIOD

The Army game was simply a bump in the road Boon said. we may not end up with a perfect conference record but we still have the opportunity tobe anexcellent team. it gives us a chance to highlight some of our weaknesses and attack those deficiencies in practice.Our team will only become stronger from thegame at Army. the weekly student newspaper of Bucknell University
