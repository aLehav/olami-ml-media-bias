On Volusia Street just west of the Wimberly library resides FAUs newest addition PERIOD It was built to make your life a little easier PERIOD

The new parking garage a necessary addition to our campus was built over the summer PERIOD It towers five floors tall holds  spaces and was in anticipation of the large number of students that are enrolled this year PERIOD Because of the latest influx of students FAU passed a proposal in May to build a second garage which will be located on the west side of Florida Atlantic Boulevard PERIOD

The first garage cost  PERIOD The funds were taken from Traffic and Parking fees PERIOD Our decal dollars were put to good use this time PERIOD The cost of the next garage will be paid for by an increase in the transportation and access fee PERIOD Students will be charged an additional  per semester bringing the total to  for fall and spring semesters and  in the summer PERIOD

For those of you who havent reaped the benefits of your decal dollars by using the garage I suggest you do PERIOD The parking lots at FAU are more stressful than the classrooms

Youve seen students who scope out a spot three aisles away and swoop in for the kill oblivious to anything and anyone in their path PERIOD Maybe you speed down an entire aisle in reverse thinking you saw someone with keys in their hand PERIOD

The parking garage is a friendly alternative to the dangerous lots PERIOD FAU student Tom Cummings has noticed the garages popularity as well I like it because its close to my classes but its pretty packed. others still endure a daily fight in the parking lots PERIOD

The inevitable Florida rain is another problem that the parking lot helps to alleviate PERIOD Every student has experienced it PERIOD The skies are crystal clear the birds are singing and it seems to be another beautiful day at FAU PERIOD But an hour later as you leave class you see dark clouds daring you as you walk to your car PERIOD Those demon clouds thunder with laughter as you run for what seems like a mile trying to keep your  textbook dry PERIOD You stumble in an attempt to get inside your car before the flood comes PERIOD Once youre on your way the rain lightens up and after about twenty minutes the birds are singing again PERIOD FAU student Sara Roberts likes the garage because it keeps my car cool and when its raining I dont have to worry about getting everything out of my car. the garage is a great escape from the unpredictable weather including the sweltering sun PERIOD Florida heat will bake your car which is guaranteed to be hot enough to bake a cake unless you park in a shaded area PERIOD As long as youre not stuck on the fifth floor the garage does a great job of protecting you and your car from the elements PERIOD

Hopefully someday parking will be easier at FAU PERIOD For now lets all be thankful that something has finally been done to relieve some stress from our daily commute PERIOD
