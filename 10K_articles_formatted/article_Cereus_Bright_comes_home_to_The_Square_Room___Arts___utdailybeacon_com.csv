Cereus Bright will have a homecoming of sorts to the bands defining and pivotal musical performance on Saturday night The Square Room PERIOD

A modern folk band Cereus Brights core is comprised of Evan Ford lead guitar and mandolin and Tyler Anthony lead vocals guitar and piano PERIOD

Ford and Anthony are frequently joined by other members including Luke Bowers on the drums Matt Nelson on the bass a violinist and a cellist PERIOD

 Ford said PERIOD 

The bands new single  was released earlier this week on iTunes and an EP of the same name will follow Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

 said Ford a junior in philosophy and economics PERIOD Theyre still there haunting you.When I met Evan he just really matched my ambition and we fit together well in terms of what we bring to the tableWeve grown a lot in the past year and I think were better able to communicate our message.For me music is often this processing agentIts how I filter through the things that Im feeling or experiencing PERIOD My hope is that I can capture a story or an emotion and display it in a way that other people can connect with.One of the things about Knoxville that we love is this weird mix of young and old conservative and progressiveWe get to encounter a lot of people who have very different perspectives here.If you think about Appalachia folk music was used as a means of escapePeople would get together at the end of the week or night or shift and they would play music PERIOD And that was their way of having a community and escaping PERIOD



Ford hopes to make an impact on the audience at Saturday nights show PERIOD

 Ford said PERIOD And were hoping to hit that week mark.Happier Than Me is available on iTunes PERIOD
