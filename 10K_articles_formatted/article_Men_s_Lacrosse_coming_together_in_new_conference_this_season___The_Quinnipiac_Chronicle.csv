The Quinnipiac mens lacrosse team is experiencing their first year in the America East conference getting used to the adjustments on entering the new conference PERIOD
As of April  the team has a  overall record going  in America East conference play PERIOD  An interesting note is that all four of Quinnipiacs losses have come by only one goal PERIOD
We lose every game by one because last year we were in a league where we got up on teams by a lot of goals and it was easy to contain them said sophomore midfielder Brian Gravel PERIOD  For our team its been a learning experience PERIOD Staying in close games and unfortunately we just let games slip away at the end PERIOD  Its just from inexperience in playing in tight games. the teams losses have been to Dartmouth Ohio State Stony Brook and Albany PERIOD The blue and gold have notched wins against Butler Canisius and Air Force PERIOD  The biggest win of the season came against Canisius on March  led by Mike Baglio who notched six goals in the game PERIOD
With seven games played and only five left to go the team has had the chance to get used to new coach Eric Fekete PERIOD
Everybodys really coming together right now said sophomore midfielder Matt Lindberg PERIOD  Once we come together a little more we wont have problems with one goal losses. goaltender T.J PERIOD Barnett has played in all seven games for Quinnipiac making  saves and posting and Hartford. that will be a tough task for the team as Hartford has recently beaten Stony Brook a team that beat Quinnipiac earlier this year PERIOD
The team needs to look to the leadership of a heavily stacked senior squad and hope their hard work pays off with some victories down the home stretch and a birth in the America East playoffs for the very first time PERIOD
