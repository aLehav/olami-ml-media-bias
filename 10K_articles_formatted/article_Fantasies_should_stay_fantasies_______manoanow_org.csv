One day while waiting for the campus shuttle I was
sitting down a bit carelessly in a short skirt and didnt realize
that some people walking toward me were staring between my legs and
probably saw my panties PERIOD Once I saw where they were looking I
crossed my legs PERIOD Since then Ive been masturbating like crazy
thinking about it and other fantasies where I expose myself PERIOD I also
tried to up it a notch by going to class without underwear beneath
a dress and wondering if anybody knew my secret PERIOD Do you think its
okay I have these fantasies and do this sort of stuff so long as
Im not purposely exposing myself

Fantasizing about this is one thing but going through with it
is another PERIOD

Imagining youre exposing yourself and masturbating while doing
it is a way of exploring your sexuality PERIOD Thats perfectly normal PERIOD
You can fantasize about it all you want PERIOD But when you bring any
fantasy to a level where people are involved youd better make
sure its with a consenting adult PERIOD Otherwise you could be making
people very uneasy and even disturbed PERIOD

While you may just be getting off on the fact that not wearing
underwear to school could make your fantasy come true and you
havent gone as far as opening your legs in class while John Doe
sits and talks with you so he can get a full frontal view  make
sure youre not just taking baby steps to get to that point PERIOD

Be warned that people do know about your  The secret
could turn into the talk of the town as it makes its way through
the grapevine to people you just wouldnt want to deal with like a
therapist or some type of authoritative figure PERIOD Theres no doubt
that youll have to deal with them if you decide to take your
exhibitionist fantasies to the next level PERIOD

If youre thinking of flipping that dress up however Id march
into your doctors office for help before you get the cuffs for
indecent exposure PERIOD

I think my boyfriend is cheating on me PERIOD Thats not the
bad part I think his lover is a guy PERIOD One night he had his friend
over at our place and they were making something in the kitchen PERIOD I
walked in to get something and I saw some petting going on between
them PERIOD His friend was behind him while he was standing at the sink
and had his arms wrapped around him and his hands below his waist PERIOD
My boyfriend was giggling PERIOD I left the kitchen right away PERIOD I havent
told my boyfriend what I saw and Im not sure what to do PERIOD Theyre
like best friends and they go everywhere together leaving me at
home wondering whats going on PERIOD

I think your boyfriend might be cheating on you too or at
least exploring his sexuality while in a relationship with you PERIOD
Those combinations are a nono PERIOD Either way hes betraying you and
theres no reason to stay with him PERIOD

As hard as it may be to hear the truth youre going to need to
confront your boyfriend about whats going on behind HIS closed
doors PERIOD How you go about that is the key PERIOD

Be cool and collected and tell him what you saw PERIOD Fight the
tears as you try to listen through all your pain PERIOD You might not
hear what he really has to say if you dwell on the fact that hes
hurt you PERIOD

But hes got to understand what hes done to you and just hope
that your understanding and strength is reciprocated PERIOD Maybe hell
turn this into a lesson that although telling the truth hurts it
can hurt more when the truth is hidden and then dug up by a loved
one PERIOD

It hurts to know that a partner is cheating and it can be
harder for others to find out that heshe may be bisexual or
homosexual PERIOD What did I do for himher to want the same sex Thats
what many people ask themselves that are in your situation PERIOD

Relax PERIOD Take a deep breath PERIOD Youll get through this but not if
you start blaming yourself PERIOD

Try to understand that were in a point in our lives when were
finding out what makes us happy especially sexually PERIOD

If he starts telling you he wants to be with you and that what
happened between he and his friend was done out of curiosity you
might have a dilemma that may weigh heavily in your mind from then
and maybe throughout your relationship with him PERIOD Should you trust
him or should you dig out

If you stay he cant blame you for never trusting him fully
especially if he wants a night out with the boys PERIOD His
unfaithfulness can easily become the basis of future arguments and
an unhappy chemistry between the two of you PERIOD

What does this spell Disaster and more hurt and pain to deal
with PERIOD This might actually drive the two of you to want to be other
people PERIOD

On the other hand this can all make you two stronger PERIOD Youve
gone through what seems like a nightmare situation and now both of
you can move on leave what happened in the past and look to the
future PERIOD Trust and open communication are the key to making this
happen PERIOD

But you can take a different road and say goodbye PERIOD

If he cares then hell know he did wrong by not coming clean
with you from the getgo PERIOD Theres no turning back though so take a
step forward instead of back and part your ways respecting his
decision PERIOD Theres no point in becoming sour about something you
cant control and thats already done PERIOD
