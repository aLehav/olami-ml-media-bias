Fashion seems to be experiencing some major dj vu which is prominently expressed in most major retail stores upon stepping foot through their door PERIOD While this means that past stylistic decadessuch as the rocker 60s hippie 70s and 80s and spunky 90s though thankfully not the cringy 2000sare makingtheir comeback debuts is it considered cheating the fashion world Some may say yes others no PERIOD

In a way it is possible to see the action of fashion looking to its ancestor years for clothes to borrowjust as younger sisters do to their older sistersas stealing or cheating their ways it makes more sense to view this as a way of recycling and revamping past styles into something new and possibly even better PERIOD With that in mind not everything in todays fashion world taken from previous stylistic decades emanates only that decade instead it mixes those previous decades with popular style choices in modern fashion as well PERIOD An example of this is the evolution of a crop top that of which is in the limelight nowadays with the patterns or prints and style of the 70s to create a mixedera look PERIOD In this way it properly exemplifies that fashion is basically a repeat of stylistic decades in order to create something new and modern while still using the best aspects of previous years fashion PERIOD

Another note about intermixing the various styles of the past decades is creating something completely new and different than what was ever created during those decades PERIOD Expanding from this think of picking a top from the 70s maybe a flared long sleeve with a funky pattern with 90s bottoms maybe a skater skirt a 60s jacket perhaps a stonewashed and ripped jean jacket with rolled sleeves and 80s tennis shoes possibly whiteKedsor simple Adidas PERIOD This ultimately creates a complete outfit that never could have been possible in any of these decades because in those times women were trying to transition themselves into a new time PERIOD Now in  women have overcome that transition and have takenastep into an age where women are empowered and this is show through their clothing and fashion overall PERIOD

Finding these historical fashion articles of clothing are simpler than you would think PERIOD First before even leaving the house check your moms or even older sisters closets because you may find hidden gems they thought would never see the light of day again If you still are on the hunt for those clothing pieces check out all the typical major retail stores especially Target Rue  TJ Maxx Old Navy and more PERIOD These stores should provide more than enough variations of styles and decadeware especially Target PERIOD For even further searching check out all your local thrift stores while these clothes will be secondhand and possibly quite worn in there is not better place to ensure findings ofpast decade clothes than a typical thrift store PERIOD Along with this thrift stores provide great items for refurbishing and creating completely new and great outfits no one would have thought of before

Fashion has changed an extreme amount in the last century but it is only expected to change equally as much in the following century that of which will be shaped by all the previous years that went before it PERIOD So get out there and dress the decade you know you were born for because now is the time
