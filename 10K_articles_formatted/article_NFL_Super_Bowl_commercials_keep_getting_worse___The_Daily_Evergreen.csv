I only watch the Super Bowl for commercials PERIOD That is a very common phrase muttered in the buildup to the big game every year PERIOD Despite that the commercials in the big game have seemingly been on a downward trend in quality while prices trend upward PERIOD

The most recent batch of Super Bowl commercials was an overwhelming meh PERIOD The only two that I can even remember less than  hours after the game is the Tubi commercial that fooled millions into thinking the remote user was changing the channel and the NFL commercial Run with it. tubi should be sued for this pic.twitter.comeHhU7Bmmzs

Other than that all of the other commercials were severely lackluster and remain rather unmemorable a problem that has been common over the past few years PERIOD

Even in  Acemetrix published an article titled Why arent Super Bowl ads funny anymore It is a common trend that has not seen any improvement since this publication PERIOD

When thinking of past Super Bowls big plays in the games first come to mind maybe then the halftime performances but after that early Old Spice Nike Pepsi and several other commercials come to mind as shaping the memory of the classic game PERIOD

Parade and Mens Health released lists of their best Super Bowl commercials of all time ranking  and  respectively PERIOD The common theme of each was that there was not a single commercial to make the rankings that were released within the previous five years PERIOD

It may be true that older commercials hold nostalgia that helps with whether or not those commercials were actually better than the ones that currently running but this does not seem to be the case PERIOD

Apples  commercial titled 1984is one of the best commercials of alltime full stop PERIOD Pepsi has made several commercials in the 90s and early 2000s that have aged extremely well and in general ads that came out over two decades ago are remembered more fondly than those of the past five years PERIOD

It is also true that recent commercials have faced an uphill battle in their advertising PERIOD Paying for an ad in it itself costs  million for  seconds according to WBNS PERIOD

With that price tag as well as the cost of production it is extremely important that the advertisement makes money and is filmed months in advance so the ability to capitalize on any trends becomes far more risky and difficult PERIOD

Being unable to capture trends means the advertisement will need to create its own trend something like the current Burger King campaign PERIOD

The advertisements are also held to a higher standard than they once were PERIOD With how America has sensationalized the idea of a Super Bowl adit has created far more artificial pressure for these advertisements to do better PERIOD

But what can even be done to improve the Super Bowl ads

The answer is simple PERIOD The ads must be more creative PERIOD

The most memorable ads of alltime feature creative themes and catchy music PERIOD They are not movie trailers they are not formulaic and basic ads for a new car they are all innovative and let the people behind the scenes spread their creative wings PERIOD

Super Bowl LVII was another disappointing year for commercials but there is always next year PERIOD
