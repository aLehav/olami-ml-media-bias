The Massachusetts softball team got off to its best since   with their performance this weekend at the Florida Atlantic University Kickoff Classic PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Minutewomen went  on the first day of the tournament losing to their host but went  on Saturday and Sunday to start the season  PERIOD The weekend was highlighted with UMass shutout victory on Sunday over No PERIOD  Michigan PERIOD

Michigan rattled off four victories in the first two days and had hopes of leaving Florida with an unblemished  record PERIOD

But after Carly Normandin doubled down the right field line to open the game and Whitney Mollica singled up the middle two batters later to score Normandin the Minutewomen scored the only run they would need PERIOD The rest was on the arm of Brandice Balschmiter who pitched seven shutout innings to seal the  victory for the Minutewomen PERIOD

We struck early and held and held PERIOD We weathered some storms in that game Sortino said PERIOD

Balschmiter would give up only six hits and one walk and only face one real challenge in the game PERIOD After the Wolverines first two batters got out in the bottom of the first Michigans Angela Findlay singled followed by another single by Amanda Chidester that advanced Findlay to third PERIOD Findlay was the only Wolverine to reach third on the day and she got no further as Balschmiter got out of the jam on her way to her third victory of the weekend PERIOD

UMass closed out the second day of the FAU Kickoff Classic with a  victory over Pittsburgh thanks to the bat of Sarah Reeves PERIOD Again the Minutewomen struck early on a two RBI single by Reeves and UMass pitching staff took care of the rest PERIOD

Bailey Sanders responded after a poor outing the first night against Florida Atlantic with a complete game performance where she gave up just one run on four hits and struck out four PERIOD

The Minutewomen exploded offensively in the opening game of the second day of the tournament to an  rout over Long Island PERIOD Every starting Minutewomen besides Kyllie Magill had at least one hit with Michelle Libby leading the charge with three hits and two RBIs  PERIOD Mollica also contributed with another three hits PERIOD

Balschmiter pitched another great game her first of two shutouts on the weekend giving up only four hits and striking out six PERIOD Sortino was impressed with the shutout because of the strength of LIUs line up PERIOD

We just took it to FIU offensively and we shut them out Sortino said PERIOD I think that is saying something because they have six lefties in their line up that are nice hitters. the only loss on the weekend for the Minutewomen came against the host of the tournament Florida Atlantic in its season opener PERIOD

After Sanders gave up a run in the top of the first the Minutewomen responded with the tying run in the bottom of the second but could not muster another score the rest of the game PERIOD Sanders would go on to give up six runs on  hits and three walks en route to the Minutewomens first loss of the year PERIOD

It was not the opening the Minutewomen had envisioned but it was the right result as UMass won its first game of the year despite having what Sortino called an off day PERIOD

Everything was off Sortino said PERIOD In the opening day win against Maryland it was just a spooky crazy first couple of pitches PERIOD Brandice was tripping over the mound and walking the first three batters. despite giving up three runs in the first two innings Balschmiter settled down on her way to her first victory of the year PERIOD She got help from her offense too as they broke open a  game in the second inning PERIOD

Jessica Serio led off the inning with a solo home run and after Davina Hernandez grounded to third Marylands Kendra Knight walked three straight batters before Whitney Mollica hit a grand slam to make it a  game PERIOD
