4956,1970-01-01,"julie Pousson left and Jennifer Echeverry right celebrate after a nondiscrimination ordinance was passed by the San Antonio city council Thursday Sept PERIOD   in San Antonio PERIOD The ordinance in part will prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity PERIOD





To whom it may concern

Coming to college means many things and everyones experience is different PERIOD When you attend a large public university like OU you are bound to come across people that are vastly different from yourself  you may even have to live with them PERIOD

As a member of the LGBTQ community I know that this is one aspect of me that makes me different from the other girls that I live around PERIOD Yes it is okay to acknowledge this difference but I am still a human being and should be treated as such PERIOD When I first came out during middle school looking back it probably wasnt the best idea I experienced a lot of bullying PERIOD People talked about me behind my back called me names and even vandalized my locker once PERIOD I became very depressed and struggled with selfharm for about three years PERIOD I am definitely not the only victim of bullying because of my sexual orientation PERIOD According to a  survey conducted by the CDC LGBTQ youth have experienced verbal and physical harassment and are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers PERIOD httpwww.cdc.govlgbthealthyouth.htm

Since I had already experienced bullying in middle school because of the fact that Im a lesbian I figured college would be another world where I was not a rarity PERIOD I thought it would be a place where I wouldnt have to worry too much about feeling alienated or subjected to petty gossip PERIOD I was wrong PERIOD Ive heard girls in my residence hall talk about me and in the hall above Ive heard that some of the girls would move out if they ever got a lesbian roommate PERIOD Hearing these things certainly upset me but I think its important to try understanding things from different perspectives and provide a little bit more insight of what its like from the other side PERIOD

People are often scared of things that they dont understand so I figured it would help to expel some myths surrounding my community and provide some pointers on how to deal with people that are different just like me PERIOD

 Just because I am attracted to some girls does not mean I am attracted to you PERIOD

 I wont watch you when you change PERIOD Thats just weird PERIOD

 Im not going to touch you while you sleep PERIOD Again thats just really weird PERIOD

 Im in an exclusive relationship just as many of you are with your boyfriends and I take my relationship just as seriously as you take yours PERIOD

 Yes I do have a rainbow flag in my room PERIOD No I wont take it down PERIOD

 You dont have to be scared of me PERIOD

 You wont catch the gay PERIOD It isnt contagious I promise PERIOD

 Remember that I am a human being too and that I deserve just as much respect as everyone else PERIOD

 Questions are okay as long as theyre respectful PERIOD

 We are more similar than you think PERIOD

It is of utmost importance you remember that people no matter how different or strange they seem to you deserve respect PERIOD Dont gossip about them even when youre sure they wont hear you PERIOD It makes you seem closedminded ignorant and petty PERIOD

In reality Im just another  yearold girl that likes nail polish Starbucks pretty dresses and shoes PERIOD Im probably not so different from the girls I live around but I think getting past the gay thing has been a challenge for some PERIOD So I hope that what Ive said has helped some to realize that just because Im different it doesnt mean we dont have things in common PERIOD It doesnt mean that I dont deserve to be treated with respect and dignity just like any other human being PERIOD
