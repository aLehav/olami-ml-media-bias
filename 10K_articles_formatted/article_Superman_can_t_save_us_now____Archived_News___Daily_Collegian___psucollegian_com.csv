The Seattle PostIntelligencer had a great cartoon today

Basically it summarizes what many of us in the newspaper industry fear That there is no hope PERIOD

To make matters worse The Associated Press released a list of newspapers yesterday that have cut back on the number of publication days within the last year PERIOD The list is even longer than I expected and includes both large papers and those small town papers youve never heard of PERIOD

Suggestions for saving the newspaper industry have been few and far between  minus the bailout proposed last week as papers have continued to falter PERIOD With no solution or end to the situation in sight I wonder what papers will survive if we keep heading down this path PERIOD
