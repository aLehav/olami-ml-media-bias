undergraduate students at all campuses in the University of Minnesota system about  are students of color according to a fall  Board of Regents report PERIOD At the Twin Cities campus the number stands at around  percent which is higher than the proportion of people of color living in the state of Minnesota PERIOD But diversity numbers at the Crookston and Duluth campuses are much lower and in Rochester only  percent of students identified themselves as a student of color PERIOD All of the University of Minnesota campuses fall short of the national average PERIOD More than  percent of U.S PERIOD college students were students of color in fall  according to the most recent statistics maintained by the U.S PERIOD Department of Education PERIOD University American studies professor Roderick Ferguson said he was puzzled that the University didnt have an aggressive policy to recruit students of color when he first came to the University PERIOD Affirmative action is the law here Ferguson said but it doesnt necessarily mean that people will practice it. rickey Hall assistant vice president for the Office for Equity and Diversity on the Twin Cities campus said the University still has work to do PERIOD When you look at the future needs of the state the future needs of the nation the future needs of corporations and the change in demographics we need to do better Hall said PERIOD The Twin Cities Room to improve Ralph Rodne an AfricanAmerican student and marketing senior from demographically diverse New Jersey said he sometimes feels uncomfortable as a student of color on campus PERIOD He said he believes that the University is not where it needs to be in creating a diverse campus for students to learn how to interact with people of color PERIOD The  percent may seem large to some other people but its very noticeable to us as students of color especially in some programs such as Carlson Rodne said PERIOD Board of Regents policy states that the University will advocate and practice affirmative action consistent with law including the use of recruiting and search processes to enhance participation of racial minorities women persons with disabilities and protected veterans. wayne Sigler director of admissions at the Twin Cities campus said the University very purposefully seeks out students of color through direct marketing high school counselor outreach efforts visiting school fairs and working with community programs among many other things PERIOD Sigler also said the University tries to start recruiting students when they are sophomores in high school and the recruitment process spans over the three years until college admission PERIOD Ferguson said that if a University does not produce a demographically diverse student population the result can be students who are not wellrounded PERIOD Universities are supposed to be places where you actually have to encounter people who are different from you Ferguson said PERIOD Because when that happens you also encounter people who have different ideas than you or a different history than you and thats the ideal of a modern university. morris leads the pack While three of the other campuses trail behind the Twin Cities the Morris campus leads the pack with  percent of its population made up by students of color PERIOD American Indians many of whom receive free tuition at the Morris campus make up  percent of those minority students PERIOD The University of MinnesotaMorris started as an American Indian boarding school PERIOD When the land was turned over to the state there was an agreement made to allow free education for American Indians said Hilda Ladner director of the MultiEthnic Student Program and assistant to the chancellor for equity and diversity PERIOD Bryan Herrmann director of admissions for the Morris campus said that through strategic planning the Morris campus is working toward a studentofcolor population of about  percent PERIOD Hermann said the University is doing that with its regular channels of marketing and partnering with organizations to get high school students into college with strong applications PERIOD The new Rochester The lowest population of students of color was at the Universitys Rochester campus where students of color make up about  percent of the student population PERIOD Jade Bakke the director of admissions at the Rochester campus said that as a new school that just admitted its first class of  undergraduate students this past fall it faces many challenges PERIOD The school only offers one undergraduate program a bachelor of science in health sciences PERIOD We do not offer multiple academic programs like other universities do Bakke said PERIOD Offering one academic program limits our applicants to only students that are very interested in an education and a career in health science research and bioscience industry. jennifer Hegland Rochesters capstone coordinator said the school is also purposefully working toward recruiting students of color by reaching out to Rochesters large Somali population and working with groups like Admission Possible and the Minnesota Association for College Admission Counseling PERIOD Hegland also said that because the school is new and small the University tries to attend every event they are invited to in order to recruit new students PERIOD Duluth lags behind Only  percent of the systems secondlargest campus identified themselves as students of color PERIOD Despite the low number Ryan Jordan a diversity counselor with the University of MinnesotaDuluths admissions office said he wouldnt identify the numbers as a problem PERIOD Working with underrepresented populations we focus on fit  Jordan said PERIOD Its a tough word to define but majors and programs come first and the second is location PERIOD Can a student handle leaving the metro location Jordan said a possibility for the low numbers is the location of Duluth a predominately white campus and area and the possibility that some lowincome families dont have the resources or interest to visit the Duluth campus which is a .5hour drive from the Twin Cities PERIOD Jordan added that any increase in diversity on campus would be positive PERIOD The UMD admissions office recruits students of color many ways including working with the Minnesota Association of Counselors of Color PERIOD Jordan said the office also makes a strong effort to visit schools in St PERIOD Paul the states most diverse public school district PERIOD Crookstons slow growth While the Universitys Crookston location has seen a 4percent increase in the number of students of color from  to  the population still sits at  percent PERIOD The best thing to do is to take small achievements and build upon them said Andrew Svec director of communications at Crookston PERIOD Svec said the campus has been working to build a multicultural atmosphere for students since the campus went through a strategic planning session where diversity was set as a core value PERIOD Svec added that international students composed  percent of the student population last fall adding to diversity on campus and in the community PERIOD Svec said the campus intentionally recruits students of color by maintaining a relationship with the Minnesota Association of Counselors of Color sending staff to attend metropolitan school fairs forming a relationship with the St PERIOD Paul school districts Multicultural Excellence Program and reaching out to the several Minnesota Indian reservations in addition to sending
