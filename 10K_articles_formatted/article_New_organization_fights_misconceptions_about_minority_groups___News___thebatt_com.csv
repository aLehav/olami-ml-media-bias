The goal of Teaching Everyone African American Culture and History is to celebrate diversity PERIOD

A new organization on campus has developed a mission to combat misconceptions of minorities and to make minority students feel more welcome PERIOD

TEAACH or Teaching Everyone African American Culture and History is an organization which aims to teach everyone about the history and current cultures of minority groups as well as mentor high school minority students to prepare them for college PERIOD It is the vision of philosophy sophomore Krystal Parks who was inspired to make a difference for minorities on campus when she noticed a lack of minority groups on campus tours PERIOD The organization began at the beginning of the spring  semester PERIOD

I know Im attending a predominantly white university so I have to be aware that racial uniformity is going to happen Parks said PERIOD But then I realized in the number of whites that are on campus or in general that go to AM how many of them actually know about our history Its only a small percentage of us so do they actually know who we are and what we do outside the stereotypes they have learned about

Shortly after Parks noticed campus tours are predominantly white in February of  some visiting high school students from Dallas were reportedly victims of racial slurs on campus PERIOD This incident drove Parks to take action and start TEAACH PERIOD

At the time I was taking hiphop philosophy so I was learning a lot about race and about social constructs and stuff like that Parks said PERIOD I just really felt like I needed to do something PERIOD I felt like it was wrong for me to just sit there with the feeling that I had and not do anything with it. tEAACH will meet every Tuesday for an hour and  minutes to provide students with a safe place to talk about their feelings perceptions and concerns about race PERIOD The meetings will typically start with a short lecture and will then open up to a group discussion PERIOD

Paige Williams is the TEAACH treasurer and said she hopes the creation of TEAACH will bring awareness to differences in how minorities are treated PERIOD

Im hoping that people will learn how we are treated in a sense differently Williams said PERIOD We are becoming a statistic PERIOD We get looked at differently as a whole and I just dont think its right PERIOD People think Oh black girl coming in late typical. we have to try harder to prove that we can do this too PERIOD We can graduate from this school too. topics discussed at meetings will include the history of African Americans at Texas AM how African Americans feel when asked if someone can touch their hair and perceptions of light skin versus dark skin in every culture PERIOD While the topics are centrally focused on African American culture TEAACH secretary Daiza Burleson said she hopes the topics can apply to all groups PERIOD

I want people who are different to know its okay to be different Burleson said PERIOD We are all different because we all have different backgrounds and cultures and skin tones but it is important to know that there is value in being who you are. tEAACH will also conduct a service project in which TEAACH members serve as mentors to students in underserved high schools PERIOD Burleson said the service project is just as important as the discussions hosted by TEAACH PERIOD

It means a lot to me because Ive been through what they are going through Burleson said PERIOD Its important that they know they do matter. according to parks the officers of TEAACH hope to have a successful first semester with the organization and want everyone to feel welcome PERIOD

There are no qualifications Parks said PERIOD Its open for everyone PERIOD What I want to hold back from is making people think that because African American is in the name thats the only people that can come and join us. log In
