Two four six eight  stop the violence stop the rape. trump Trump Trump. the chants from opposing groups mingled with conservative British activist Milo Yiannopoulos presentation in the William Pitt Union assembly room on a Tuesday night last semester PERIOD

A crowd of more than  people joined Yiannopoulos that night for his lecture on free speech  some bringing support others bringing protest signs and middle finger greetings PERIOD Yiannopoulos is known for his outspoken denial of topics including unequal pay statistics and the necessity of the Black Lives Matter movement PERIOD

By the end of the night Pitt police escorted about  people out of the room PERIOD A few students left sobbing PERIOD

Throughout the night about  students held up signs saying My friend who is depressed needs a safe space and My friend who was raped needs a safe space. the Safe Space Network an information and resource website defines a safe space as a place where anyone can relax and be able to fully express without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable unwelcome or unsafe. while safe spaces are sometimes thought of as an escape from controversial speeches like Yiannopoulos the term has spurred a debate all on its own especially on large college campuses where political and social standpoints are frequently flung about in public PERIOD

Supporters of safe spaces say they offer a place to get away from prejudices and represent a standard of respect PERIOD Others feel that safe spaces shelter young people from the real world and push for conformity to a leftist viewpoint PERIOD

Sara Yablonski a rising junior and the rising Rainbow Alliance president said respect is at the core of the idea PERIOD

A safe space simply represents an environment where we can strive to respect each others identities and life experiences and find respect in return Yablonski said PERIOD

After Yiannopoulos visit other conservative speakers came who prompted similar discussions a pastor who thinks gender reassignment surgery is a sin and presidential candidate Donald Trump PERIOD

But none of them brought     national attention like Yiannopoulos whose colleagues at Breitbart News Network a conservative news outlet backed him up by commenting on Pitts fiasco PERIOD

Charlie Nash a commentator at Breitbart wrote that the reactions of Pitt students who called for a safe space from Yiannopoulos viewpoints were a sure sign that academia is failing. these are students who are legal adults and on the cusp of entering the real world yet theyre in tears over the fact that someone who they need not even listen to disagreed with them he continued PERIOD

According to Ben Kew another Breitbart writer safe spaces can be the exact opposite of what theyre intended to be as some student groups attempt to impose safe space policies on others PERIOD

This can lead to them actually trying to control other peoples right to speak and hold a platform Kew said in an email PERIOD This is an infraction of freedom of speech and the first amendment a key component of a civilised society and one of the foundations on which America was built. is the concept of a safe space destroying the sanctity of college campuses once thought of as breeding grounds for intellectual debate and passionate protest

According to activist Moira Kenneys book Mapping Gay L.A. the idea of safe spaces began in the mid1960s within gay and lesbian bars PERIOD At the time a safe space was somewhere a person could be out and resist oppression  until police raided the bar PERIOD

The term itself was first used sometime during the Womens Liberation Movement in the 1960s and 1970s PERIOD It was not meant as necessarily a physical space but a community where women could distance themselves from patriarchal thought PERIOD

Safe space was used to describe the consciousnessraising groups popular at the time where women would discuss their lives and how they related to gender inequality PERIOD

At Pitt protests about police brutality Black Lives Matter and a  minimum wage swept through campus on an almost monthly basis last year PERIOD And when antiabortion advocates set up in front of WPU arguments erupted between the two sides PERIOD

It would seem that hearty debate and discussion is still thriving in academia  at least for now PERIOD According to Kew safe spaces would put an end to that and completely destroy the voice of the underrepresented right which exists in much greater volume in the real world. the negative consequences of safe spaces are that they do not prepare students for the outside world which is not a safe space Kew said in an email PERIOD As someone who suffers from anxiety it is my firm belief that creating a safe space where all reference to anything that is possibly triggering  only leads to students with mental health issues becoming further enveloped in their own selfpity. marcus Robinson the current president of Rainbow Alliance said acknowledging that you have the power to hurt someone through your words and actions is a part of life as natural as cruelty PERIOD

Thats not coddling thats just basic human kindness to one another Robinson said PERIOD By no means is a safe space a perfect space because no ones perfect  At the end of the day it is just making a space for people thats as welcoming as possible. flipping Kews argument Robinson and the rest of Rainbow Alliance have tried to diversify their events based on the real world. were acknowledging that these other identities need to exist and that they need to be talked about he said PERIOD

On Pitts campus clubs that support marginalized groups become safe spaces of their own rising sophomore Jeff Unterberger said PERIOD

I think any of the safe spaces would be clubs that are made to help support a minority group such as Black Action Society or Rainbow Alliance Unterberger said PERIOD Theyre important so people  can be expressive of their thoughts. like the spaces that formed naturally in gay and lesbian bars in the 60s Yablonski said organizations like Rainbow Alliance offer a reprieve from discomfort PERIOD

The first time I went to one of Rainbows events during freshman year I knew instantly that I was in an environment where I did not have to hide or dance around myself Yablonski said Their sense of comfort didnt rely on my conformity to any social norms but on mutual respect. being an undergraduate Yablonski said is taking your first real step into the world PERIOD Its a place where students often claim to lose and find themselves and each other in and out of safe spaces PERIOD

I look at the undergraduate experience as just one avenue a person can take to grow themselves as an individual Yablonski said PERIOD An important part of growing up is recognizing that you will meet other people who are vastly different from you whose experiences and feelings are real and oftentimes painful. alexa Bakalarski contributed reporting PERIOD
