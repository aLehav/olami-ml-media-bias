Though the offseason typically represents an opportunity to recover after a long and arduous season of competition the way teams choose to spend their time off can set the tone for the upcoming season PERIOD

For the No PERIOD  Michigan softball team the offseason wasnt a time simply to sit back PERIOD Even after falling just short of a Womens College World Series title last year the Wolverines knew better than to assume past success is an indicator of future results PERIOD If anything Michigans secondplace finish instilled a source of motivation for the team to tackle its offseason workouts in order to bridge the gap between itself and the reigning national champion No PERIOD  Florida PERIOD

A key cornerstone of that regimen was the Oklahoma City Challenge PERIOD

Named for the site of the Womens College World Series the OKC Challenge pits four teams of Wolverines  a blue team a maize team a gray team and a white team  against one another in a threeday series of strength and conditioning challenges in the days leading up to Thanksgiving break PERIOD

Despite an  start to the season Michigans lone loss came at the hands of the Gators reminding theWolverines why the OKC Challenge laid the foundation and set the pace for their offseason routine PERIOD

The main purpose is to compete and to be challenged said Michigan coach Carol Hutchins PERIOD We put them into groups so that its the team competing to beat the challenge PERIOD We made it very difficult this year we upped the ante and its something the kids really embrace and work really hard at PERIOD Youll have to ask them how much they could move over Thanksgiving break. the first day consisted of four timed stations  medicine ball burpees sandbag runs tire flips and sled pushes  where the team that covered the most distance or completed the most repetitions won PERIOD A doubleelimination tug of war tournament topped off day one PERIOD

The second day followed a similar format with four different timed stations  hurdles and ladders bear crawls sled pushes medicine ball throws and weighted barbell carries  where distance and repetitions again served as winning objectives PERIOD

The third and final day proved to be the most demanding courtesy of a strenuous  a.m PERIOD obstacle course that included a sandpit crawl a weighted sled push and pull box jumps bear crawls and a weight drag and sprint capped off by a team relay race PERIOD

Though a winning side is crowned in the OKC Challenge the ultimate payoff isnt about the competition itself PERIOD Rather the challenge is designed to teach the Wolverines important lessons about perseverance and teamwork that they can apply to the season ahead PERIOD

Its a lot of grueling exercises to push us really hard physically and see how we react mentally said junior shortstop Abby Ramirez PERIOD A lot of it is just pushing yourself to see how far you can go and I think we all learned how strong we are if you dont give up PERIOD You can do a lot more than you think you can. during the eightmonth absence of games save for a few fall exhibitions it can be difficult to recreate the feeling of live competition between seasons PERIOD For Michigan the OKC Challenge simulates that experience to fill the void with energy PERIOD

Its very effective said fifthyear senior righthander Sara Driesenga PERIOD Its hard to find that game pressure to put on yourself when youre just running in the conditioning sessions PERIOD So when we do competitions thats when we push ourselves PERIOD That is how we want to be out on the field so were able to pull that out of nowhere when we need it. though most of last years squad is returningno team is exactly the same in two consecutive seasons PERIOD The offseason provides a space to create a new team dynamic mixing and matching new and old players to form a cohesive unit PERIOD Using the OKC Challenge to its advantage Michigan examined its strengths and weaknesses to better understand and prepare for the potential struggles inherent in its upcoming journey PERIOD

Its a dogfight its a battle said senior captain and outfielder Olivia Richvalsky PERIOD But the team aspect also makes you think about strategy so it definitely correlates to what we would have to do on the softball field PERIOD

You look at your team and you see whos stronger in this area and whos faster in this area and who you need to pair together so the strategy that goes into it gets our competitive juices going PERIOD When its so physically exhausting thats the mental part that really comes out and I think thats the reason this has become such a staple. the title of the OKC Challenge is no accident PERIOD The intense difficulty of the challenge mirrors the onerous nature of the Wolverines journey to reach their ultimate destination  the Womens College World Series in Oklahoma City PERIOD Despite having that main goal looming overhead Michigan understands it wont be a cakewalk which explains the level of effort in its dedicated approach PERIOD

Hutch talks a lot about onepitch focus Richvalsky said PERIOD We not only narrow down the series to the game to the inning we narrow it down to the pitch PERIOD Its kind of our overarching mission and thats what keeps us focused every day PERIOD We have an end goal in mind but we cant get from zero to  PERIOD Its a progression so I think thats what keeps our perspective and keeps us focused. after the Wolverines heartbreaking loss in the Womens College World Serieslast season the name of the OKC Challenge took on more meaning PERIOD Hutchins made a clear effort to push her team even harder knowing the team would need to learn how to rely on both their teammates and themselves in order to achieve their ultimate goal PERIOD

We didnt lighten up in their physical training at all Hutchins said PERIOD We challenged them to try to push them to their frustration level so they can learn to deal with it PERIOD Its not about just making them feel good every day its about how they respond because when the game comes nobody feels good unless things all go your way PERIOD We try to make practice harder than the game so that the game seems easier and I dont know if we accomplished that PERIOD I guess well find out. only one game can decide if Hutchins pushed the Wolverines hard enough A June contest in Oklahoma City will provide her answer PERIOD
