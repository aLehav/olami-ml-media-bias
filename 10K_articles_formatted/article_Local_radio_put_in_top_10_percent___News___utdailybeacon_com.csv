In a study commissioned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting WUOT . fM was ranked in the top  percent of public radio stations PERIOD

WUOT is one of the oldest public radio stations in the Southeast PERIOD It initially signed on the air in  and today the format consists of talk radio classical and jazz music PERIOD

Its comparing apples and apples Regina Dean director of the station said of the report PERIOD This reporting mechanism evens the playing field. the report entitled Having it All aggregates data across a broad spectrum by analyzing financial reports and evaluating user data and also by analyzing the audience service of the station and its financial status PERIOD

According to Dean this allows for a comparison among different radio stations regardless of the size of their markets or whether or not theyre associated with a university PERIOD

Were very pleased to think that when you compare us to other stations were in the top  percent Dean said PERIOD

Daniel T PERIOD Berry the stations program director said that he feels great about the report PERIOD

It says were doing our job he added PERIOD

Dean has just celebrated her tenth anniversary at WUOT and at the beginning of her tenure she was given the goal of moving the station into the top quartile of American public radio stations PERIOD This report shows that she has met her goal and then some Dean said PERIOD

Dean gives the credit for WUOTs success to her staff and listeners PERIOD

The programming staff is clearly doing a good job she said PERIOD If the programming wasnt valued people wouldnt listen and they wouldnt donate. berry agrees that quality programing has helped WUOT succeed PERIOD

I would like to think that its because we provide radio programming that serves the needs of East Tennessee Berry said PERIOD We try to present a combination of news information entertainment and classical and jazz music which appeals to a broad spectrum of East Tennesseans PERIOD

Dean also believes that listeners in Knoxville have also played a role in the stations success because Knoxville listeners understand how public radio works and that their financial contributions are a necessity to maintaining the station PERIOD

Listeners here are very loyal she added PERIOD

Those affiliated with the station expect the improvements at WUOT to continue over the next several months PERIOD

Sometime in early summer we are going to go digital Dean said PERIOD

Transmitting in digital will allow WUOT to use a second audio channel or SAC to extend programming she said PERIOD After the transmitter goes digital during the summer WUOT plans to convert its studios and production facilities to digital in the fall PERIOD
