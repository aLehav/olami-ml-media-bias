Islands

Rating Three and a half out of five stars

Arms Way

Anti

Nick Thorburg is growing up PERIOD Kind of PERIOD And whether youre a strict believer in the Unicorns  the group Thornburg spearheaded in the early 90s  or you think Islands is the best option for a future sound one things for sure Nick T PERIOD has found himself an eclectic sound PERIOD

Expanding upon 2006s Return to the Sea the groups second fulllength Arms Way is no less charming bubbly or oddly depressing PERIOD Thorburg brings over many of the elements from earlier Unicorns albums juxtaposing slippery jovial guitar bumps against unsettling devious elements Creeper and utilizing aptlyplaced fleet string sections to augment the thundering guitar lines Arms Way while lamenting car wrecks PERIOD

But whats most entertaining is the way the group can float in and out of genre without drawing too much attention PERIOD In Jaime Vous Voire Quitter the group frantically plummets through a sky of trepid guitar movements before settling upon a ground of calypso dance music PERIOD It sounds unsettling and unwarranted but the mood fits perfectly into an album with so many odd connections already PERIOD The Kids Dont Know Shit also expands on Thorburgs love for exploring certain depressing aspects of youth with movements through flowery sections and portions which evince the screaming teen anthem about everything being gone PERIOD

Still the group sometimes approaches overindulgence PERIOD A track like Pieces of You and its consistent plodding gets lost in the mix of fun while anything after the albums tenth track the seemingly splendid closer To a Bond just gets left behind after such subtle fading flare PERIOD

Is Nick T PERIOD maturing his sound or falling back into his old style Although the latest record seems placed on the fence between the two either way hes pulling a respectable balance now PERIOD

Scarlett Johansson

Rating One and a half out of five stars

Anywhere I Lay My Head

Rhino

For an album bearing her name and picture on its cover its surprising that actressturnedsinger Scarlett Johansson doesnt really take the spotlight on her music debut PERIOD Its not that she doesnt try to make an impression  the album a collection of  Tom Waits covers and one original song cowritten by Johansson reeks of avantgarde pretentiousness  but her voice is so flat and drownedout it seems as if shes playing second fiddle to the production PERIOD

Anywhere I Lay My Head is not necessarily awful PERIOD Its an audacious experimental work that filters Waits through the atmospheric electronica of the Eurythmics PERIOD Unfortunately Johansson is no Annie Lennox and what little success the album achieves cant really be attributed to her PERIOD Instead its TV on the Radios David Sitek as well as a backing band of other familiar artists who make this album even remotely notable PERIOD Some of the tracks are fetching in their oddness like the bouncy dance club reworking of I Dont Want To Grow Up or the bizarre musicboxtinged I Wish I Was In New Orleans. but Johansson  whose album this is after all  never really registers PERIOD Her voice is flimsy and unemotional and in the few instances when its actually audible above the music it fails to resonate as in the albums first single the tranceinducingly dull Falling Down which is perhaps the worst first impression this album could have made PERIOD

Its admirable that Johansson wanted to try something different PERIOD This is a strange outofleftfield work that deserves minor attention PERIOD But none of that attention should go to her PERIOD
