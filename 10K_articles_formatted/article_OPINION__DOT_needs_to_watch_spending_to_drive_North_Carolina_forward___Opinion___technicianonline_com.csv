Earlier this month Gov PERIOD Roy Cooper named a new secretary for the state Department of Transportation DOT ending an extended period of success and strife for the agency PERIOD The old head Jim Trogdon was appointed in January  soon after Cooper took office PERIOD The secretary had his work cut out for him having to contend with Hurricanes Matthew and Florence while also attempting to speed up ongoing construction projects PERIOD

A combination of factors led to the DOT running out of money last year prompting an emergency funding bill from the legislature PERIOD After this winter failed to churn out much icy weather the department finally seems to have its feet under it PERIOD Assuming he is confirmed by the state Senate the new appointee Eric Boyette should take this opportunity to finish fixing past errors and start providing North Carolina with more of the fast modern infrastructure it needs PERIOD

Trogdons departure was met with profuse respect from both sides of the aisle with House Speaker Tim Moore highlighting his impeccable leadership. cooper was less vocal when he announced the change but has previously defended Trogdon fiercely from attacks by State Treasurer Dale Folwell PERIOD

As to why Folwell made those attacks the DOT has suffered a harsh couple of years and while much was outside of Trogdons control some miscommunication between him and the legislature left a stain on his record PERIOD In addition to the hurricanes the state Supreme Court ruled a 1980s law unconstitutional which had allowed the DOT to reserve private land for highways without buying it PERIOD Paying out for the subsequent lawsuits has run over  million PERIOD

That said the DOT was still treading water and in fact it had a positive budget balance that the legislature asked it to spend more of PERIOD In response Trogdon asked the state to allocate money for employee raises and issue bonds to accelerate construction projects PERIOD That said the agency spent a bit too much causing the DOT to run out of money which forced it to cut back dramatically on construction PERIOD The DOT also spent more money than it was supposed to on raises due to a misunderstanding in how the money was allocated PERIOD A consultants report also found that miscommunications led to rampant overspending by local divisions PERIOD

The DOT has the potential to create a brighter future if it keeps a more conscious eye on spending and the legislature continues to allocate enough funding to do crucial repairs and start big projects PERIOD For instance the DOT is leasing an autonomous shuttle to loop around NC States Centennial Campus for a year with the aim of building trust between the public and a cuttingedge technology with major potential impacts on our economy PERIOD

In addition the agency continues to maintain and augment our road system to make sure that workers can get to their jobs consumers can access all that they need and NC State students can reliably access the benefits of Raleigh and our institution PERIOD Transportation is central to our livelihoods and while its not the flashiest way to advance our wellbeing its impact is unparalleled PERIOD New leaders must ensure it keeps surviving and thriving for years to come PERIOD
