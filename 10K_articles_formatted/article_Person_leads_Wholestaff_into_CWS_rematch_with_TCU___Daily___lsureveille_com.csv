LSU senior Zac Person  addresses the media with Lil Brown Suga during LSUs first practice at the NCAA Mens College World Series on Friday June   at the TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha PERIOD

OMAHA  For a group of pitchers identified as a person it seems fitting that a reliever with the last name Person which is pronounced differently than the common noun will toe the rubber first for the LSU baseball team on Thursday night PERIOD

Senior lefthander Zac Person will lead Jack Wholestaff into the Tigers  rematch against TCU at 7p.m PERIOD at TD Ameritrade Park looking to once again avoid elimination from the College World Series PERIOD

With only two solidified starters all year Jack or Johnny Wholestaff has become the term LSU coach Paul Mainieri uses when the starter and subsequent relievers have an inning limit in midweek games or the third game of a weekend series PERIOD Designed to keep the opposition off balance Mainieri usually determines how long each pitcher goes based on the flow of the game but he acknowledged Person  . eRA could go longer because of his experience PERIOD

Whether Person pitches deeper into the game the Wholestaff approach has been favorable for the Tigers PERIOD In the games Mainieri has planned on using multiple pitchers LSU is  PERIOD Although Person who hasnt appeared since he threw  of an inning against University of LouisianaLafayette in the Baton Rouge Super Regional has become the Tigers setup man for most of the seasonhe was an easy choice to give the ball to first PERIOD

My thought was he hasnt appeared yet in these first two games and arguably hes one of our top four pitchers Mainieri said PERIOD I didnt want to wait until the eighth inning or seventh inning to bring him in if we were losing by six runs PERIOD Id rather have him pitch meaningful innings when the game is still in doubt PERIOD Lets see if he can get us off to a good start and well see where we are after the first couple of innings. before coming to LSU the southpaw was a starter at his native junior college LSUEunice and was the pitcher of record in LSUs  win against Auburn earlier this season PERIOD That weekend freshman ace Alex Lange did not pitch due to a minor injury allowing Person to start the first three innings in that victory PERIOD

Person who was a ninth round draft pick by the Houston Astros also is tied for the most appearances on the team and opponents have the lowest batting average against him among all LSU pitchers PERIOD

Following the Tigers  loss to the Horned Frogs  in their opening game in Omaha Mainieri had a lengthy discussion with his club sharing his vision of how LSU could rebound and make run in the tournament PERIOD After the meeting was over Person reminded Mainieri of a similar situation his Eunice team faced in  PERIOD

Zac came up to me after the meeting and says Coach I dont if you remember but when I was at Eunice we lost the first game of the JUCO World Series one year and came back to win it all Mainieri said PERIOD Hes a really confident kid PERIOD Hes very poised and experienced. person will certainly need to show off his poise against a hungry TCU team which is coming off a gutting  loss to Vanderbilt in a winners bracket game Wednesday night PERIOD Horned Frog junior lefthanded pitcher Alex Young held the Commodores hitless through the first six innings before Vandy junior first baseman Zander Wiel launched a solo home run to open up the top of seventh PERIOD

Despite notching just three hits it ended up being all the Commodores needed to send TCU to an elimination game against the Tigers PERIOD But when LSU faced the Horned Frogs on Sunday TCU took advantage of several Tiger miscues including four errors five walks and three hit batters to turn in doubledigit run performance PERIOD

Person though felt like the Horned Frogs ability to capitalize on the mistakes was bigger than the mistakes themselves PERIOD

You dont get to this point without capitalizing and thats what theyre really good at Person said PERIOD Theyll drive the ball when they need to PERIOD Theyll hit to the guy they need to hit it to to get that run in things like that PERIOD .. PERIOD We had the two errors to put the two men on base but still without them executing base knocks those guys dont score anyway PERIOD .. PERIOD If you give them a little bit theyll take what you give them and then theyll add on to that PERIOD

Theyre a kind of team that likes to apply pressure PERIOD If we dont give them enough they cant apply any pressure like Vanderbilt did Wednesday night. no better example of not giving a team an inch to work with was what Lange did in the final eight innings against Cal StateFullerton PERIOD After giving up three runs on four hits in the first inning Lange was dominant striking out  batters while allowing just two hits on his way to a complete game in the Tigers  win PERIOD

But Lange needed a boost from the offense to finally get the Tigers their first win at TD Ameritrade Park and it finally came in the third inning PERIOD With an adjusted lineup which featured junior shortstop Alex Bregman in the leadoff spot the Tigers exploded for four runs on six hits to take a  lead PERIOD In total LSU tallied  hits but it was dissatisfied with the run production

Although the Tigers will face TCUs talented redshirt freshman righthander Mitchell Traver  . eRA Bregman feels the lineup is on the cusp of its first truly dominant performance in Omaha even in a large park with a usually strong inward wind PERIOD

We want to have a big game Bregman said PERIOD We think that it is coming soon if we just keep putting together good atbats like we did Wednesday PERIOD If we get  hits we should score more than five runs PERIOD .. PERIOD In Omaha you cant really hit the ball hard up PERIOD You got to hit the ball down PERIOD Anything that gets above the outfield bleachers is an out PERIOD .. PERIOD If we hit the ball on a line here were a lot better team. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
