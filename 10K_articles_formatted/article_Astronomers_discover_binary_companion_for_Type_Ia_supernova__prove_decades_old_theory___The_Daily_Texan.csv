5974,2023-07-11,"uT astronomers and a flash of blue light revealed the story behind some exploding stars PERIOD

While working at Harvard in  UT research scientist Howie Marion and his team of astronomers found evidence supporting a decadesold space theory PERIOD The discovery provides insight into the formation of Type Ia supernovae the explosive endstage of some stars lives according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal PERIOD Researchers have used Type Ia supernovae to study dark energy and measure the expansion of the universe PERIOD

Astronomers have long argued over the origins of these supernovae PERIOD In one longstanding theory Type Ia supernovae emerge from a binary system of two stars a white dwarf and a mainsequence star PERIOD

Mainsequence stars are younger ordinary stars such as the sun that burn hydrogen PERIOD If their initial mass doesnt reach a certain size they wont become hot enough to reach the next stage and burn carbon PERIOD These stars become dense white dwarfs PERIOD

A white dwarf is sort of like this cinder thats left behind when the star burns out Marion said PERIOD

In the binary system gravity transfers mass from the companion star to the white dwarf PERIOD Once the white dwarfs mass hits a critical point it explodes and forms a Type Ia supernova PERIOD

When the white dwarf blows up some of the material should come out at great speeds nearly the speed of light and smack into this companion star and it should get hot and it should get bright and emit some extra radiation Craig Wheeler a UT professor of astronomy and coauthor of the study said PERIOD

After explosive material hits the companion star it emits additional light which researchers discovered in the form of excess blue light around Supernova 2012cg PERIOD This matches theoretical models for the interaction confirming the existence of a companion star PERIOD

The excitement is because weve been working toward this for decades Wheeler said PERIOD This is the first time its been done. the first discovery of a binary companion verified a series of hypotheses that astronomers have long assumed to be true PERIOD

Type Ia supernovae have similar brightnesses each time they form which allows astronomers to calculate their distance by how dim they appear from Earth PERIOD This property led previous researchers to use distance of supernovae to discover that the universes accelerating expansion is driven by dark energy PERIOD

Scientists have trouble observing supernovae after the initial explosion because the early stages are dim and brief Wheeler said PERIOD

To make collecting observations easier the astronomical community collaborates and shares their supernovae discoveries PERIOD Astronomers at a University of California system observatory initially detected Supernova 2012cg in  and shared their discovery with other researchers including Marion PERIOD

Researchers made observations using several telescopes including the HobbyEberly Telescope at UTs McDonald Observatory PERIOD Collaborators on this paper came from  institutions including Harvard AM Princeton Texas Tech the University of Tokyo and Aarhus University PERIOD

Although this is the first evidence for a companion star researchers urge that this isnt a definitive model for Type Ia supernovae formation PERIOD Scientists will collect more observations on Type Ia supernovae and continue to study their formation PERIOD

In some sense this is sort of the opening salvo in whats going to be a major enterprise over the next decade Wheeler said PERIOD
