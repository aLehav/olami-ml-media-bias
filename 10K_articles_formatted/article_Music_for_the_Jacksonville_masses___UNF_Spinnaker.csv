Spring Break is a time to flee boring everyday routines and escape the pressures of school and work by jetting off to somewhere exotic relaxing and exciting PERIOD  Sounds great for those who can but if you find yourself planted in Jacksonville you might as well treat yourself to some great concerts making their way through our city PERIOD

March  Its Friday night and all of your worries should be gone PERIOD After that midterm exam and the inevitable sigh of relief strap on those party pants and skip down to the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall where Sister Hazel will be playing PERIOD Come on you know you loved them PERIOD Head to the show to bring back some feelgood memories PERIOD The fun starts at  p.m PERIOD

If Sister Hazel doesnt appeal to you maybe the L.A.based Dum Dum Girls will PERIOD  Dee Dee Jules Bambi and Sandy are the four subpop lovin chicks who make up the band PERIOD Theyll be sharing the stage with Reading Rainbow Dirty Beaches and The Cougs PERIOD  With such an eclectic string of musicians and talent Jack Rabbits will be flooded with tunes all night long PERIOD  The show starts at  p.m. dont be late PERIOD

If prettygirl rock and old school melodies dont soothe your musical needs your last chance is to catch Streetlight Manifesto and A Loss for Words at Freebird at  p.m PERIOD  Rise to the erratic trumpet blares and bigband sounds of the drums banging from Streetlight Manifestos stage performance for a more edgy end to your night PERIOD

March   Youre going to have to make a tough choice tonight PERIOD The Ready Set is playing at Freebird at  p.m PERIOD with The Downtown Fiction We Are the In Crowd and You Me  Everyone We Know PERIOD The Seedy Seeds will be at Jack Rabbits at  p.m and Sugarland is at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena at  p.m PERIOD

Youve probably heard The Ready Sets Jason Witzigreuter on the radio singing his hit single Love Like Woe and Sugarlands hit Need You Now. but you probably havent yet heard of The Seedy Seeds PERIOD This trio stems from Cincinnati Ohio and is stopping in Jacksonville on their way across the country toward Austin Texas to perform at South by Southwest for the third time PERIOD

The Seedy Seeds composed of Margaret Darling Mike Ingram and Brian Penick have just released their third fulllength album titled Verb Noun. they also have a sevensong EP Roll Deep. with a combination of accordion banjo keyboard drums guitar bass synthesizer and rockin female lead vocals their sounds will bounce you around in the grooviest way possible PERIOD

What is most interesting about the group is that Darling and Ingram started the band not knowing how to play the banjo or the accordion  two key instruments on their albums PERIOD Penick joined later already knowing how to play drums PERIOD

We wanted to make the band to learn and use instruments we already owned but hadnt yet mastered Darling lead singer who also plays guitar and accordion in the band told the Spinnaker PERIOD Were pushing new instruments on Brian now PERIOD Hes picked up bass guitar and the glockenspiel. march  Youve given your ears a break for a few days and its just in time for the next show PERIOD The Pauses Orlando natives and yet another twoman and onewoman trio are performing at Underbelly in Riversides Five Points at  p.m PERIOD The band is debuting its first fulllength album A Cautionary Tale March  PERIOD

The album was produced by noted indie recording artist J PERIOD Robbins and mastered by T.J Lipple PERIOD Its jampacked with funky electronic blips and bops in combination with guitars drums bass bells and even a ukulele PERIOD

We took a long time to create the album because I wanted to start something that felt more natural to me said Tierney Tough lead vocals bass and keyboard player for the band PERIOD

Jason Kupfer who plays guitar bells and ukulele is the reason for most of the electronic melodies and beats that resonate in each tune PERIOD Nathan Chase who plays drums and adds to the collection of electronic punches meshed well with Tough and Kupfer PERIOD After months of working together as a trio the band decided it was time to record PERIOD

We finally got to a place where our material was at its best Kupfer said PERIOD There was a lot of expense planning and prepping for this album. the Pauses will showcase songs from an album two years in the making and you wont want to miss it PERIOD

If you prefer to savor a bunch of bands all at once some festivals are coming to the Jacksonville area that will give your ears a reason to binge PERIOD

March   Take your time to celebrate St PERIOD Augustines first Celtic Music and Arts Festival in this citys Colonial Spanish Quarter PERIOD  The festivities begin March  and end with a St PERIOD Patricks Day celebration in downtown St PERIOD Augustine PERIOD  There will be live classical traditional and modern musical performers from Ireland the U.S PERIOD and the Celtic region of Spain PERIOD The festival will also feature food dancing workshops and a parade March  PERIOD Tickets range from  to  per person depending on the selection of dates and features PERIOD
