At Alumni Field the No PERIOD  Michigan softball team wins PERIOD

Thats what the Wolverines will be banking on this weekend as they begin their quest for a second national championship against Valparaiso Central Michigan and No PERIOD  California in the NCAA tournament this weekend PERIOD

Michigan  overall is undefeated in  home games this season  of which were completed in mercyrule fashion PERIOD More often than not the Wolverines put on a batting clinic for loyal fans scoring at least eight runs in  games including a 21run performance against Michigan State PERIOD In total the offense outscored opponents by  runs and batted well over . as a team PERIOD

Its where we want to be said Michigan coach Carol Hutchins to reporters on Wednesday PERIOD We spend so many weeks on the road so to get to be home here at the end of the year is an added bonus just to be in our comfort zone and in front of our fans PERIOD Its such a great reward to our fans. despite the apparent youth on this Michigan roster Hutchins may have enough experience for everyone PERIOD

This weekend marks the Wolverines nineteenth consecutive NCAA tournament bid and twenty-first in program history PERIOD Under Hutchins Michigan has advanced past regional finals in all but three tournament appearances most recently in  and has hosted  regional tournaments PERIOD

The Wolverines are  alltime against Valparaiso with their last matchup coming in March of  PERIOD The Crusaders  lost seven straight games and failed to win a series until the conference championship PERIOD A lateseason offensive surge from outfielder Amanda Korbb could spell trouble for sophomore lefthander Haylie Wagner who has given up  home runs in  appearances this season PERIOD

In the midst of a 22game winning streak Michigan took care of Central Michigan in five innings to the tune of  runs and four home runs PERIOD The Chippewas  finished second in the MidAmerican Conference standings before winning the conference tournament for an automatic berth into the postseason PERIOD Central Michigan will be carried by senior center fielder Macy Merchant who is hitting . with  hits PERIOD

Though Michigan has not faced California since  the Golden Bears hold a  alltime record against the Wolverines PERIOD The other nationally ranked team in the Ann Arbor regional No PERIOD  California  poses the biggest threat to Michigans path for a second national championship PERIOD Having made it to the College World Series in  the Golden Bears boast more experience playing late in May  something Michigan lacks PERIOD But California dropped nine of its last  regularseason contests due in large part to the absence of senior ace Jolene Henderson PERIOD Her return the final game of the season was important though as she pitched a complete game and allowed just two runs PERIOD

Of late the Wolverines have been unpredictable PERIOD A powerful lineup that feeds off the previous batter struggled at the hands of Big Ten pitching late in the regular season PERIOD Despite the bounty of talent  a lineup that includes the Big Ten Freshman and Player of the Year in freshman shortstop Sierra Romero along with seasoned veterans junior Caitlin Blanchard and senior Ashley Lane  Michigan was bounced from the conference tournament in the semifinals last weekend PERIOD

Romero was named to the Great Lakes AllRegion  first team on Thursday while her teammates Blanchard and Lane were named to the second team PERIOD Sophomore righthander Sara Driesenga was also named to the second team PERIOD

Blanchard and Lane who are hitting . and . respectively have helped form a formidable middle of the lineup with Romero PERIOD The duo has combined for  RBI and  home runs this year behind the national playeroftheyear candidate Romero PERIOD

Romeros had a great freshman year for us but the key to that is having hitters behind her because otherwise people can just pitch around her Hutchins said PERIOD The fact that Blanchard and Ashley Lane have done such a great job all year whether its power or just putting the ball in play and just capitalizing theyve done great. as of late Romero has struggled at the plate and in the field going 0for8 over the weekend after hitting  RBI and  home runs this season PERIOD Her cold streak in at the Big Ten Tournament hindered the Wolverines from advancing past the semifinals PERIOD But the freshman isnt in Lincoln Neb. shes at home PERIOD

You need to just move on and Im really excited to have this weekend to just start over because things didnt go our way Romero said PERIOD Now we have a way to change it and do something about it PERIOD

Im really excited especially from what the upperclassmen have told me about how crazy it gets here and how packed and just the environment and having home field advantage. but if one thing is certain about this weekend its the fans PERIOD

Through unseasonably cold weather and long innings of Wolverines batting around their lineup the crowd at Alumni Field has been a dense one  if only visible under blankets PERIOD The average attendance this season was just under  PERIOD

More than  tickets were sold to softballs faithful within the first  minutes of ticket sales PERIOD Within  hours of ticket sales the regional final was sold out leaving just the bleacher seats for remaining fans PERIOD

Were excited to be at home and take care of business Lane said PERIOD Theres nothing better than being at home. if Michigan advances out of the regional this weekend it will host the winner of the LSU regional the following week PERIOD

And if anything is better than playing at home its playing at home again PERIOD
