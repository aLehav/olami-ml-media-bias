Though many people associate Afghanistan with conflicts very few know much about Afghan food PERIOD Thats why the idea of Ariana an Afghan restaurant located at  Brighton Ave. near the Harvard Avenue T stop in Allston intrigued me PERIOD

Since it opened in the spring of  Ariana has built a reputation as one of the best and one of the few restaurants serving Afghan cuisine in the city PERIOD Upon arriving on a Friday night my friend and I were seated immediately which as any foodie around can tell you is pretty unusual in Boston PERIOD

At first glance the atmosphere did not live up to my expectations PERIOD The tables were placed closely together and the ambiance was a bit lackluster with no open windows to the nice summer night and tacky wall dcor PERIOD Despite the less than stellar first impression I held onto hope that the quality of food would outweigh the quality of my surroundings PERIOD As the waitress brought over a warm basket of naan accompanied by three dipping sauces things suddenly took a turn for the better PERIOD

The menu had a reasonablypriced selection and as a vegetable lover I was happily surprised with a vegetarian section PERIOD Afghan cuisine is typically centered on rice and Ariana offered various types of seasoned rice dishes alongside eggplant pumpkin and leeks PERIOD As for the nonvegetarian meals the rice was paired with mostly lamb or beef PERIOD

We finally settled on the Banjan which is panfried eggplant spiced up and baked with tomatoes and served on a mint and yogurt sauce as an appetizer and the vegetarian special which was a blend of baked pumpkin fried eggplant sauted spinach tomatoes and okra all served over rice and Banjan and Kaddo Challow baked and panfried pumpkin and eggplant served with challow rice and tomato sauce as our entrees PERIOD The Banjan appetizer which arrived quickly consisted of panfried eggplant with fresh tomatoes and yogurt sauce PERIOD The dish was delicious with an interesting mix of spices and the portion was perfect for two PERIOD

Soon after we finished our entrees arrived PERIOD The combinations in the vegetarian special . was so fantastic the sweetness of the pumpkin mixing perfectly with the spice from the other vegetables PERIOD By the end of the meal I was scraping the remaining sauce of my plate with naan a sure sign of a good meal PERIOD The Banjan  Kaddo Challow was a similar dish of pumpkin and eggplant served over rice but it included a tomato sauce as well PERIOD

To top it all off we ordered Bucklawa . a pastry accompanied with an assortment of nuts and spices alongside honey caramel PERIOD Out of all the things we tried this was our least favorite PERIOD It tasted overly spicy and in the end I wished I had just finished my meal with a familiar ice cream cone from the store around the corner PERIOD

All in all I was happy with my experience at Ariana PERIOD What the restaurant lacked in ambiance it made up for with delicious and budgetfriendly food PERIOD It was definitely something different yet still tasty and Im glad I advanced out of my comfort zone and gave it a try PERIOD
