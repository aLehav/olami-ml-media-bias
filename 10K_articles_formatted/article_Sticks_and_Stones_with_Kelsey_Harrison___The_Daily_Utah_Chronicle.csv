A couple of years ago in upstate New York artist Kelsey Harrison began to collect sticks PERIOD Thats right sticks  sticks and ideas about what it means to exert control over space PERIOD At the time Harrison said shed been looking at a particular violent moment in history but this moment was not something so obvious as war or civil rights PERIOD Instead she concerned herself with freeways and looked at the way in which they had chopped up America into boundaries and uprooted the lives of the people established in those areas PERIOD She began to see patterns and became acutely aware of the hubris involved in urban development especially as it related to the historical developer Robert Moses PERIOD On her wall where her pieces are displayed she pins up all of these disparate ideas from her research A Beautiful Mind style PERIOD Then she pointed to the notes that I was scribbling down in makeshift shorthand PERIOD You might have to do something similar she said PERIOD

For her a sense of entitlement to space ultimately boils down to an exercise in whiteness PERIOD Its a scale of meddling thats hard to imagine she said PERIOD It would be different for Robert Moses a straight man compared to her a queer woman to dictate the use of space PERIOD So with that in mind she began to fit sticks together experimenting with perfect fits in rudimentary joints PERIOD What does it mean to control to perfect or to own

Wood is the only medium I enjoy for its own sake you know Harrison said PERIOD Its something you can float towards. originally clay acted as her springboard into the art world PERIOD After coming to the University of Utah which has a more craft centered arts program she began to move into vogue forms PERIOD Still she expressed the sentiment that no one should ever be talked out of their medium. both intellectual and downtoearth Harrison appreciates a challenge PERIOD As an assistant professor she is often thrown into random classes which might be frustrating for another educator PERIOD Instead she views it as an opportunity Theres a lot of learning PERIOD You can never predict what the students will do. being in that position creates situations of forced innovation PERIOD Much of her teaching involves conceptual practice with themes that she would not normally use in her own work ones she described as wistful subjects including memory time and identity PERIOD Leading these subjects is its own challenge. in spite of the differences identity comes up in her work as well but not as selfexpression PERIOD For her identity is more a matter of analyzing the social forces shaping us  she looks at group identity as expressions of power and social behavior PERIOD Specifically as someone deeply invested in the physical manifestations of ideas she sees this in what our cities look like PERIOD She talked at length about the high rise luxury condos in Salt Lake City an interest sparked by her work in New York PERIOD You see these condos with grandma names like Ruth and they say shes worth the wait. its like their equating buying to deflowering PERIOD And then what does it mean when you live inside Owning is like prostitution. here she whipped out a favorite phrase of hers Thats gnarly. the names of these buildings hit ideologically driven bullet points using words like freedom as garnish PERIOD Its like you like freedom heres this condo she said PERIOD Ownership becomes inextricably linked to the idea that luxury is freedom PERIOD She would rather look at the material world in this way to see what it tells us about culture rather than her personal history PERIOD Her work is ultimately about not my whiteness nobody gives a s about that. instead she wants to know how we are affected how space and land ownership influences her fantasies and expectations. in a new exhibit that opened on Jan PERIOD  Harrison pursued this fascination with ownership especially as it relates to colonial ideologies PERIOD She is one of many artists that will be a part of the Utah Museum of Contemporary Arts show Shady Acres. the show is an exploration of suburbia the implications of leaving the suburbs and what remains of it PERIOD Playing off of suburban tropes in the show the release picture features a pleasant bright neighborhood with a hotboxed car dead center PERIOD

For her part Harrison is reworking an exhibit that spoofs Robinson Crusoe which she had previously installed in Chicago PERIOD The story has significance for her as a document of the time that initiated a new colonial relationship with the world PERIOD She finds this life of entitlement becomes salient at this point in history like a guidebook on white thinking. the original story followed a castaway who builds a oneman civilization enslaves the first man he meets and spends  years in selfpity PERIOD Harrison sees this original story as a desire for ultimate agency and selfsufficiency PERIOD However she doesnt think we should be abjectly dependent as the notion of being entirely selfsufficient is gross to her PERIOD

In the exhibit Harrison takes on the role of a modernday Crusoe which exaggerates the selfpity to the point of comedy PERIOD Her Crusoe is a real estate agent in Daybreak a practically selfsustaining suburban community in Utah designed by only two godheads. naturally this falls right into Harrisons thematic forte PERIOD After Crusoe is fired for being too gungho he leaves with all of his office supplies drives away and shipwrecks. her film of adventure if you can call it that plays in the exhibit showing the crash and Crusoes attempts to rebuild his life with office supplies PERIOD The rest of the exhibit preserves the artifacts from the crash including a phony drone made out of a can of wood stain with the label colonial maple. she also incorporates a world globe with a miniature piano and grandfather clock fixed to it possibly emphasizing an imagined colonizers world view PERIOD When we spoke she was thinking about making a shipmast out of a hatrack and said the shirt could be the sail maybe. she seems to keep her ideas flexible which stands out in light of how she feels about control PERIOD She allows her projects space to grow organically PERIOD

Her recent work in Germany a public work for the Pfalzer Hof came back to the question of who has control PERIOD Similar to her work in New York she wanted to explore what it meant to occupy space PERIOD The project which was to convert timber from a historic hotel into a sculpture required her to bring her own tools PERIOD Technically she could have brought small power tools but she decided to be excessively strict. again she likes a challenge PERIOD As she contributed to the public landscape the project brought her back to thinking about occupied space PERIOD It led her to consider the transience of things created especially as most architecture leads us to believe that it is a natural part of the landscape PERIOD Growing up she said I looked at the world like everything was a given but its not  the world is barely slapped together. while in Germany she visited an ancient restaurant built around  PERIOD Unlike modern construction the timber was exposed which struck her PERIOD Her sculpture is constructed in the same way PERIOD Nothing in the product is obstructed  like her work in New York the rudimentary joints are exposed PERIOD It shows design takes some of the magic out of what is built but also the sense of powerlessness PERIOD A great portion of what we use is covered by sleek metal and plastic and sometimes we forget what needs maintenance PERIOD Harrison knows people that feel betrayed when their cars break down PERIOD How is it that we need to serve the machines that serve us She sees an almost Crusoelike inclination to say call me master. people tend to have little participation in the physical composition of their lives PERIOD As she allows people to see the basic construction fit sticks together and chart our world view from the colonial period Harrison compels us to look at our cityscape in a new light PERIOD Theres a need for collaboration and maintenance in our everyday lives PERIOD

Shady Acres will be showing at UMOCA from Jan PERIOD  until May  PERIOD
