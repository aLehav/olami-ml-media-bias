Most would agree that Jack Stanton a southern governor Andrew Shepherd a history Most would agree that Jack Stanton a southern governor Andrew Shepherd a history professor and Josiah Bartlett an economist are an eclectic group PERIOD They all however became American presidents PERIOD They all sat behind the desk in the oval office and spoke behind the seal of the president PERIOD Of course the desks were all props oval offices all Hollywood sets and their staffs very talented groups of actors PERIOD

Last week as I sat in the theater enjoying the latest political satire Man of the Year it occurred to me that Hollywood creates a political fantasy over and over again PERIOD Its a political arena that is very different from the reality we usually observe PERIOD But one that I believe can exist where there are no attack ads no hidden agendas or individuals afraid to stand up and voice their opinion PERIOD

A political fantasy complete with characters that not only allow us to believe that a good man or woman can get elected but also encourage it PERIOD It is complete with movies or television that reinforce that someone with ideas and the ability to make a difference can actually win an election PERIOD

In Primary Colors The American President and NBC series The West Wing politics come to the forefront of entertainment PERIOD Stanton Shepherd and Bartlett are actors playing the president of the United States PERIOD

As much as I enjoy the faux politicians I am left comparing what exists behind a studio set and what actually exists in Washington PERIOD

Why can a Hollywood director produce politicians that seem more real than anything the American electorate has to elect How do Aaron Sorkin and teams of writers create language that presidential speech writing staffs have not done in decades

There are moments in Primary Colors where Jack Stanton is another typical politician  a womanizer and master manipulator PERIOD But then you realize that behind the southern charm and lush behavior the character is a decent man PERIOD

In The American President a team of writers including the chief architect of The West Wing crafted a speech for President Andrew Shepherd Michael Douglas that could have sent an educated group of voters to the poles to vote for the fictitious candidate PERIOD Rhetoric that is honest and invigorating PERIOD Words that make the audience believe in the American political process PERIOD

Perhaps if these two characters were really politicians we would discover that they arent the great men I believe them to be PERIOD But I dont think that would be the case PERIOD

For seven seasons the cast of The West Wing dared to offer insight into the world of the president of the United States PERIOD The awardwinning drama captivated audiences each week with its portrayal of a president actually working for the people PERIOD There are moments in episodes of The West Wing that blur the line between fiction and reality PERIOD Times when you stop for only a second to think  what if Josiah Bartlett were really president

In one of my favorite episodes the senior staff is gathered in the oval office at the end of day when everything that can go wrong does PERIOD They are tired and frustrated but willing and ready to accept the challenges of tomorrow PERIOD In the words of Chief of Staff Leo M If were going to walk into walls I want us running into them at full speed PERIOD Were going to lose some of these battles and we may lose the White House but were not going to be threatened by the issues PERIOD Were going to bring them front and center PERIOD Were going to raise the level of public debate in this country and let that be our legacy. these men are characters created in the imagination of brilliant teams of industry professionals PERIOD They allow us to see what politics can look like and at times does PERIOD

Im not willing to accept that integrity and idealism in politics only exists in the movies and on television PERIOD I want to watch a candidate and listen to them speak about America and issues that affect Americans PERIOD I want them to use words like legacy. i want to be certain that behind an expensive suit and American flag lapel pin is someone who actually gives a damn PERIOD I want to know that they have the courage to say what they believe to be right and the conviction to stand by their decisions PERIOD
