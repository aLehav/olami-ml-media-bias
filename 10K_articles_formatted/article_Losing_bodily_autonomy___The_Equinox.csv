8390,2023-10-25,"the restrictions imposed by Texas lawmakers on abortion has triggered a detrimental conversation about womens rights to their bodies lawmaking ethics and individual freedom as constitutionally imposed on American society PERIOD At the end of any day the concept of right and wrong has been blurred by neverending counter arguments so much so that basic human decency has been thrown out PERIOD

The new law introduced in Texas made abortions after six weeks of pregnancy illegal with hefty charges afterward PERIOD Private citizens are given the right to sue anyone who performs aids and abets an abortion with the implementation of this law PERIOD

Most women dont even know they are pregnant until they are six weeks along completely removing aboriton for Texas women off the table before they can even consider it PERIOD This is a blatant refusal of bodily autonomy PERIOD There is already a precedent Supreme Court case  Roe v PERIOD Wade preventing states from banning aboriton before viability the point at which a womans fetus is able to survive outside of the womb PERIOD The viability point is  weeks of pregnancy making the six week cutoff for abortion illogical PERIOD Texas lawmakers ignoring precedent and scientific fact only proves that this law is purely about control over womens bodies PERIOD

Rape and incest resulting in pregnancy is not an exception for abortion in the Texas abortion law PERIOD Rape survivors who fall pregnant would be forced to carry the fetus of their rapist PERIOD The emotional turmoil that comes with being denied the concrete meaning of the word No and now being denied the right to decide whats best for your body is enough to strip people of their identity PERIOD There is already enough stress behind surviving sexual assault being denied the option to select abortion is inhumane PERIOD Incest is historically immoral and the incestuous pregnancies often give a baby defects lasting a lifetime PERIOD The harm an incestuous pregnancy could do to both the fetus and the mother isnt worth carrying out PERIOD Both of these situations should end in the woman getting the right to choose what to do with her body not having more of her rights denied by the lawmakers PERIOD The government should have the best interest of the American people in mind PERIOD

If supporters of this law claim to be prolife how are they not looking twice at the horrors of forced motherhood PERIOD The prolife mindset needs to be refined to proquality life PERIOD Reforming the foster system childrens shelters affordable healthcare and affordable housing should be a top priority if lawmakers are going to force women to have a baby they may not want PERIOD Prohibiting women from making the decision of whether or not they are ready to support another human being is not prolife its antiindividual freedom PERIOD Regardless of the prolife defense there is an irrifutable uderlying theme of control behind denying abortion PERIOD Along with the antiabortion conversation there needs to be a complete reassesment about the true meaning behind the definition of prolife. the abortion outlaw stemming from Texas is an outright denial of a womans bodily autonomy PERIOD It goes to show the American people that regardless of logical arguments against this law the desperate burn for government control over human bodies radiates farther than basic decency PERIOD
