Kevin Elliott an Eastern alum who graduated with a degree in geography in Dec PERIOD  can remember that one day he felt a drastic change in the weather PERIOD



It was when he experienced a blast of winter as he put it PERIOD

That day was a day in the early 60s PERIOD This happened last spring when he was working at the WalMart garden center putting out plants PERIOD

The blast of winter and increased temperature was part of global warming  an ongoing concern PERIOD

In that oneday alone the weather had increased over  degrees PERIOD

Elliot went from wearing a heavy coat and goggles one day to wearing a light windbreaker the next PERIOD

This is not something that just started to happen PERIOD

Temperatures have been climbing regularly since the industrial revolution said Kathy Bower of the geology  geography department PERIOD Fossils are an impact from the Industrial Revolution. while not every scientist will give the exact answer on the problem there are some factors of the problem that most scientists will agree on like the ozone layer PERIOD

The dwindling ozone layer is allowing more solar radiation to reach the surface of the Earth said Cameron Craig instructorclimatologist who also runs the EIU WeatherCenter from the department of geology  geography PERIOD

Some of the problematic factors for the warmer weather are related to rapid increase of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide from burning fossil fuels said Belayet Khan of the geology  geography department PERIOD

More of the greenhouse gases contribute to the greenhouse effect PERIOD

There has been a trend of carbon dioxide in recent years which is increasing temperatures said Kathy Bower of the geology  geography department PERIOD

Another proposed cause of this warmer weather pattern has to do with the sun itself changing PERIOD

The notion that the sun is in a changed state and the sun has been the strongest over the past decades contributing to increased global temperature Khan said PERIOD

A number of new hazards come along with the warmer weather factors are affecting not just humans now PERIOD

If the weather has been warmer for a prolonged amount of time damage will likely be done Khan said PERIOD

Severity of the hazards will likely depend on how extreme the temperature is and how persistent that extreme is as well Khan said PERIOD

The affects of the warmer weather patterns do not just affect the environment for a little while and then leave the effects of this weather usually last a while PERIOD

It can certainly affect our everyday life by adversely impacting agricultural production water shortage transportation and energy consumption Khan said PERIOD Hazardous effects of extreme temperatures may also incorporate many facets of our environment such as epidemics diseases heat strokes resurgence of deadly diseases. more coverage is being done on topics such as global warming and these harsh temperatures PERIOD

USA Today ran a story Dec PERIOD   on global warming recently titled Global warming cast an unrelenting shadow. the story focused on parts of science considered having developments in PERIOD

It global warming led the pack as the main science story of  the story reads PERIOD This was a year in which the topic moved from being theory to fact in the scientific world and perhaps more important in the minds of many Americans. the hazardous effects are most likely not going to be the same for different locations because not every location will have had the same exact weather increase PERIOD

While some locations will see a drastic warming others will have a slow warming Craig said PERIOD

The growing idea of going green may appear as though it could reverse some of these problems but it cant Craig said PERIOD

Even if everyone started to go green not much could be done to reverse the damage that has already been wrought Craig said PERIOD

When we reduce our harmful influence we can reduce the effects but not reverse them PERIOD On the other hand if we continue on this path as we have in the past the effects could be catastrophic Craig said PERIOD
