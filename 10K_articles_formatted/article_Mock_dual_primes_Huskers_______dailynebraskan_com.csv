A wrestlers memory can fool him sometimes PERIOD

Like Saturday morning when the Nebraska wrestling team squared off against each other for the first intrasquad meet of the  season PERIOD The mock dual was designed to give new wrestlers a feel for competition before they see their first real competition of the season PERIOD

The wrestling team travels to Wyoming the weekend of November  for its first dual and open meet of the season PERIOD

 senior 190pounder Ryan Tobin said PERIOD 

For most of wrestling practice competitors dont worry about referee calls or boundaries for the mat PERIOD They just wrestle hard the whole time PERIOD But when two men square off on the mat in competition their strategies change to use the boundaries and the ref PERIOD

Coach Tim Neumann said those were a couple of areas his team needed to work on in the next week PERIOD

 Neumann said PERIOD 

The dual does give a chance for coaches to see individual and team mistakes as well as make decisions on a starting lineup for the first dual of the season a  p.m PERIOD contest against Wyoming Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

There were a few surprises in the individual matches of the dual but there wasnt a lack of action PERIOD It started with one of the most closely contested matches all day PERIOD Tobin ranked No PERIOD  in the country at  needed a lastsecond takedown to beat junior heavyweight Abe Boomer  PERIOD That match could have changed a few plans for Neumann and Assistant Coach Mark Cody PERIOD

Tobin is still cutting weight to get to  so hell wrestle in the heavyweight class for the majority of the fall semester PERIOD That is unless Boomer beats him out PERIOD

 Neumann said PERIOD

That wasnt the only match that had varsity implications PERIOD Dusty Morris beat Jos DeAnda but still has to wrestle Allen Hankins this week to decide varsity status at  pounds for the Wyoming dual PERIOD The 150pound spot too is up in the air PERIOD Billy Gabel will wrestle Ryan Bauer for the starting job PERIOD

 Neumann said of his team PERIOD 

For Cody it showed him what areas his upper weights need to work on PERIOD However Neumann said the upper weights were the most solid part of the team PERIOD As a team Neumann found  areas the Huskers need to improve PERIOD

 he said PERIOD
