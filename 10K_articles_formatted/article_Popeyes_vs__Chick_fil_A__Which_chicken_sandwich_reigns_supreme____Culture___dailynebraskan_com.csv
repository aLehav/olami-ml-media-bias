Popeyes new chicken sandwich is pictured on Sunday Nov PERIOD   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

The creation of Popeyes chicken sandwich was underway for two years until it debuted on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD In a mere two weeks the threemonth supply of the sandwich was completely sold out PERIOD On Nov PERIOD  the chicken sandwich was reintroduced with the promise that it is here to stay PERIOD

The popularity and success of Popeyes chicken sandwich is owed to the incredible hype it has garnered on social media PERIOD One of the first sparks that ignited the battle between Popeyes and ChickfilA began when ChickfilA posted a tweet Bun  Chicken  Pickles  all the heart emoji for the original. popeyes responded with a pointed .. PERIOD yall good

Whether planned or not it was a genius marketing move to pit the two chickenrestaurant giants against each other PERIOD Chicken connoisseurs began to pick sides and vehemently petition for their favorite sandwich PERIOD Today the murmuring voices are put to rest PERIOD

The two eateries will be judged based on four factors  the most important being taste followed by service ambiance and price PERIOD

ChickfilAs chicken sandwich was invented in  by founder S PERIOD Truett Cathy and the recipe has stayed the same since PERIOD With a thick piece of juicy chicken nestled between two buns and topped with a few pickles ChickfilAs chicken sandwich is a tough one to beat PERIOD

Popeyes chicken sandwich consists of a hefty piece of extravagantly breaded chicken pickles and mayonnaise PERIOD Upon first bite its unclear if Popeyes chicken sandwich is good or not which is a big red flag PERIOD If something isnt instantly delicious upon the initial bite its simply not PERIOD During the next few bites the integrity of the sandwich becomes more evident PERIOD It doesnt have a very distinctive taste mirroring the taste of fried chicken rather than a chicken sandwich PERIOD Its crispy and much more breaded than ChickfilAs chicken which only alludes to fried chicken even more PERIOD

The chicken doesnt seem to have any original seasoning PERIOD Instead it possesses the same greasy texture as fried chicken PERIOD And bizarre as it sounds it tasted similar to a simple ham sandwich at some points due to the lack of seasoning PERIOD Aside from the chicken there is a plethora of smooth and thinly sliced pickles PERIOD Unlike ChickfilA which leaves the sandwich to stand alone with only two magical ingredients chicken and pickles Popeyes adds mayonnaise on its chicken sandwich PERIOD However the mayonnaise on the Popeyes sandwich doesnt add any special taste factor while ChickfilAs chicken is juicy enough to make the sandwich flavorful on its own PERIOD

It seems Popeyes chicken sandwich is just a piece of fried chicken masquerading as a chicken sandwich PERIOD

Since its chicken sandwich is a new hot commodity its no surprise that Popeyes drivethru and lobby were filled with endless customers PERIOD However with a small facility and few employees service is polite but sluggish PERIOD A request for extra sauce can be a hassle for a customer as employees are consistently occupied with another task PERIOD Additionally Popeyes doesnt appear to have any signature sauce like its competitors famous ChickfilA Sauce PERIOD

At ChickfilA the service is unparalleled PERIOD Granted it does have a bigger facility and more employees but guests are well taken care of with swift and prompt assistance PERIOD Sauce is handed out at the time of order and food is ready within minutes PERIOD Its the little things like convenient sauce distribution that go a long way PERIOD

Popeyes exudes the feeling of a homestyle meal and a laidback household while ChickfilA embodies freshness and a closeknit family PERIOD With a brand color palette consisting of red and a bold yelloworange color the inside of Popeyes lobby gives off a rushed getitandgo vibe PERIOD While in some ways the environment is relaxed it doesnt feel like a place one can let out a breath of air and unwind for a while PERIOD

ChickfilAs red and white color scheme results in a more inviting lobby with lots of open space and lightcolored walls PERIOD The ambiance in ChickfilA is more gentle and allows customers to take their time and enjoy their meal and company PERIOD

Lastly there isnt much of a price difference between the two chicken sandwiches but there is still a notable one PERIOD At Popeyes a sandwich costs . while a meal complete with seasoned fries and a drink comes in at . pERIOD At ChickfilA a sandwich costs . while a meal that comes with waffle fries and a drink totals . pERIOD

Resoundingly ChickfilAs chicken sandwich is superior PERIOD The eating experience is nearly revolutionary from the actual taste of the sandwich to the service environment and the price point PERIOD

Its easy to say ChickfilAs chicken sandwich is simply the best and end right here PERIOD However its worth mentioning that people have different preferences PERIOD

So in an effort to be inclusive in the battle of the taste buds a distinction will be made  if its a classic neverdisappointing chicken sandwich youre craving ChickfilA is the way to go PERIOD If its a friedchicken taste youre after Popeyes is the poultry joint for you PERIOD
