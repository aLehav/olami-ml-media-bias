Reader forum Activity fee helps all in the end

Kara Annechini is the vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government PERIOD

The attention and controversy that has recently surrounded the issue of a proposed student activity fee has led to much discussion some heated debates and many misconceptions PERIOD At the same time you the students have not been given all the facts PERIOD

The intent of this letter is to inform you of the facts concerning the student activity fee and the harsh realities facing the future of this University PERIOD We implore each one of you to take the time to read this letter Add this information to that which you already have and continue to educate yourselves about an issue that affects YOUR life YOUR education and YOUR school PERIOD

Since the day all of us began our college careers in Happy Valley Penn State has been struggling with dwindling resources PERIOD The state on whom we depend for about  percent of our general budget has disappointed us once again by allocating  million less than our requested  million budget PERIOD

At the same time the Tuition Challenge Grant prohibits Penn State from increasing tuition above an approximated . percent annually PERIOD This agreement with the state made available for this year  million in revenue that would otherwise be accounted for only by an additional increase of . percent PERIOD

Three years ago the University began to tighten its own belt and mapped out a strategic plan for its future PERIOD The Universitys Future Committee decreed that  percent of every departmental budget be cut and reallocated back into the University for future use PERIOD

What do all these facts and figures mean Due to a lack in state funding an absence of increased tuition revenue and the Universitys efficiency rate Penn States resources are hurting PERIOD The student activity fee is a proposed solution to the problem of balancing the academic curriculum and maintaining a quality outofclass experience and support for student activities PERIOD

Here are the facts

  increase per semester per student PERIOD

 While Wisconsin receives  million for student activities Penn State receives about half of that and remains one of the very few universities in the country without a similar activity fee PERIOD

 The estimated . million generated for University Park and the  for the Commonwealth Education System will under no circumstances be commingled with the operating budget PERIOD The funds will be used solely to improve student life and cocurricular activities PERIOD

 The current and expected funding will be placed in an equity fund to address unmet needs and will be overseen by a committee of students and students affairs administrators PERIOD

 The proposed target areas for improvement at University Park are

 HUBRobeson expansion PERIOD

 Support for University Concert Committee and theater productions PERIOD

 Nonalcoholic activities PERIOD

 Upgrade intramural fields and equipment PERIOD

 Enhance funding for student organizations only the funding will expand not the role of the Student Organization Budget Committee as has inaccurately been perceived PERIOD

 Enhanced funding raised in the CES will stay there PERIOD Feeling the statewide cutbacks in higher education CES students deserve support and services from Penn State University regardless of location PERIOD

Unfortunately there is a great need to expand student services activities and support but the Universitys ability to provide that is dwindling PERIOD The current economic conditions at Penn State leave us no other choice PERIOD Its now up to us the students to do our part to make the University the best possible experience for ourselves PERIOD

It has been well documented that a rich outofclass experience greatly enhances learning and development PERIOD Dont we owe it to ourselves to make that possible Increased funding for student activities will not only leave a lasting positive impact on student life but will be significant to the future of Penn State PERIOD It will create a University environment that will be attractive to potential students while at the same time make Penn State more appealing to the students who are already here PERIOD

We are speaking out in favor of the student activity fee not as student leaders but as students just like yourselves PERIOD We also encourage every student to speak out about this issue PERIOD If you agree with the fee be heard PERIOD If you dont agree with the fee be heard PERIOD

Students this is what all the discussion and controversy are about PERIOD Stand up for what you want your experience to be while you attend Penn State PERIOD Both of us are graduating at the end of the year and will probably never see the benefits that a student activity fee could bring but our support is for the future of Penn State PERIOD

We hope you think about that too PERIOD
