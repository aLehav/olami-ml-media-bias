2569,2019-02-11,"nancy Graces new gossip show masquerades as a news show deceiving viewers PERIOD

Jeff Koch WriterSeptember  

As television news ratings keep dropping cable news has an ace up their sleeve PERIOD

Nancy Grace southern belle and broadcaster for CNN Headline News is the poster girl for the newest trend in TV news that Ill refer to as gossipnews. she is not the only such reporter but she is the most successful and the most appalling PERIOD She debuted her show Swift Justice this month in which she plays judge to smallclaims court cases  minus the robe gavel your honors and official legal credentials PERIOD Her second murdermystery novel just became a New York Times best seller PERIOD Her talk show however specialises in the exploitation of its guests PERIOD

This is not breaking news coverage PERIOD This is disaster tourism PERIOD This is tragedy profiteering PERIOD This is the lowest common denominator in reporting and it is despicable PERIOD
Wherever there is a kidnapping rape or triple homicide Nancy Grace will be there to capitalize on the tragedy of the human experience PERIOD Whether it is the burnout of Lindsay Lohan or the ancient history of the heartbreaking Natalee Holloway murder nobody can beat a dead horse as thoroughly or as efficiently as Miss Grace PERIOD

We are used to TV shows pandering to the schadenfreude interests of the American population PERIOD Lets face it some people love to watch other peoples lives shatter and fall apart PERIOD Daytime talk shows inform us who is or is not the father PERIOD The show Cheaters hires private investigators to discover a cheating spouse then films the gruesome public confrontation from multiple angles and the list goes on PERIOD

Never before though has such a display gone under the guise of a news program PERIOD  Nancy Grace and her ilk profit from the misfortunes of others and call on freedom of the press to justify their lowlifepandering snuff through the airwaves PERIOD As a journalism major and therefore the larval form of a future reporter this disgusts me PERIOD

Even the venerable Oprah has gotten in on the act PERIOD In a recent episode this summer the lone survivor in a tragic boat accident was a guest on the show PERIOD The capsizing killed three men two of whom were former NFL stars making the incident a very public one PERIOD

Survivor Nick Schuyler was accused by Oprah of wanting to profit from the experience based on accusations by the victims families and on his  recently published book recounting the accident PERIOD The irony is totally lost on Oprah  she herself brought Schuyler onto the successful daytime talk show effectively helping him accomplish exactly what she is accusing him of PERIOD

TV journalists and talk show hosts are getting into the habit of exploiting human tragedy for the sake of ratings PERIOD News coverage should be about reporting on tragedy because the public needs to be informed not so we can pull up a chair and enjoy the show PERIOD

At the end of the day however we have no one to blame but ourselves PERIOD These shows exist because they garner ratings PERIOD People love to watch Nancy Grace PERIOD Ratings are the only thing that matter to these networks PERIOD So when watching TV let us remember what we are to set our minds upon good things noble things trustworthy things PERIOD And in doing so lets avoid the vapid gossip shows that pollute the airwaves PERIOD
