Sunday Feb PERIOD  marked the eighth year Chancellor Joe Gow will be UWLa Crosses chancellor making him the longest running chancellor in UWSystem history PERIOD Since Feb PERIOD   Gow has represented UWL and advocated for the advancement of the UWL community PERIOD
Before becoming a chancellor for UWL Gow went to school for journalism and got his Masters degree in communications PERIOD He was a professor at Alfred University in upstate New York for  years which he considered one of his favorite parts of his career due to his love for working with students and helping them discover themselves PERIOD
His eight years havent been exempt from temptation PERIOD In his Dec PERIOD   address to students and faculty he confronted the rumors of is departure from UWL for a position in UWMadison PERIOD
In considering the possibilities in Madison Ive also had to confront the reality that I would have to leave UWL PERIOD And Im pleased to tell you that Im not willing to do that And I have come to the conclusion that there is no place Id rather be he wrote PERIOD
Gow remarked that no day as a university chancellor is ever the same as the last PERIOD Many things he does fall along the lines of public relations where the main focus is to keep the university moving forward and to improve it any way he can PERIOD
Another aspect of his career that he stressed is that although the chancellor leads of the university academic administration is not a job that can be handled by one person alone PERIOD Rather it is a collaborative effort that requires the minds opinions and perspectives of various people PERIOD
Even though this is a collaborative community that I work in I have to make decisions that other people cannot make or do not want to make in which case I have to respond to them and be the leader PERIOD This is especially true in times of crisis which are certainly not easy to deal with said Gow PERIOD
Gow also gave insight as to how the university has changed in his time at UWL PERIOD The stadium Centennial Hall and Eagle Hall are just a few of the new establishments on campus that have been enacted during Gows career PERIOD
Gow also gave a preview of where the university is heading PERIOD Plans for the future include the new student center which is set to open in  and the new science building which is set to open fall of  PERIOD
