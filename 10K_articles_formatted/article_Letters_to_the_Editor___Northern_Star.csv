November  

Student encourages equal coverage of attacks on campus

As NIU students we are concerned with how we took time to vote for our one hundredth anniversary Homecoming court but were unable to see the winners recognized PERIOD Homecoming week should be about school spirit PERIOD I understand that no student regardless of their race deserves to be attacked and the student body should be informed PERIOD Nonetheless there have been various attacks on students where it has either been disregarded by the Northern Star or placed in a small area of the police beat PERIOD During the first week of school ambulances escorted three black students to Kishwaukee Community Hospital for head wounds after being assaulted with bricks outside of College Square Apartments PERIOD There was nothing in the paper for students to read about this incident yet this attack over an alleged pizza of a white student makes front headlines for three days PERIOD In response to an earlier letter to the editor by freshman Briana LaGrone where she accuses the Star of being racist and failing to include that the victim allegedly provoked the attackers with racial slurs junior Terry Teeters responded by writing What does that matter The man was severely beaten over something as trivial as a  pizza. it does matter PERIOD It matters to the entire campus that is forced to believe the attack was over a pizza while the Northern Star disregards the arguments of the attackers PERIOD Teeter also states that the Northern Star only publishes credible information over alleged happenings. why is the victims pizza story more credible than the attackers story Both are alleged happenings since neither one has been proved and should both be equally published PERIOD

Law enforcement presence for weekend of Homecoming excessive

As an NIU student several things concern me about the NIU community PERIOD The most important is the police terrorism PERIOD I do not see the reason for the excessive amount of law enforcement that was here during Homecoming weekend PERIOD Wasnt their purpose to ensure student safety Instead they spent their time harassing black students and visitors PERIOD This harassment included but was not limited to stopping cars simply because they had rims disrupting every black party to ensure it would be shut down and blocking the entrances of College Square Apartments and University Village PERIOD Why was there riot training for officers held at the Convocation Center the day before the main concert and party which was the main Homecoming attraction for urban blacks all over the state Would they have held this same training if the main attraction was Ashlee Simpson The actions by law enforcement ensured that black students and their visitors were interrupted at any attempt to enjoy Homecoming weekend sending a message for future Homecomings PERIOD This theory is supported when passing College Square Apartments and noticing how officers were escorting people to where they needed to be and frisking black students for looking suspicious whereas on Greek Row a predominantly whitepopulated area one squad car was posted trying to maintain order PERIOD Where was the law enforcement when the freshman was beaten by four attackers in the front of Grant North Towers Ill tell you where they were patrolling the streets looking for cars with rims and suspicious looking drivers PERIOD

Death of NIU student deserves requires more coverage compassion

I sit here in disbelief after reading a total of three compassionless sentences about the life and death of NIU student Patrick Stokes PERIOD Being that he was in his last year at NIU I would expect that the Northern Star could have written a more heartfelt story than the one that was printed PERIOD There was more information about him in the Northern Stars resource the Daily Southtown than in the Northern Star PERIOD What reasons does the Northern Star have for not celebrating the life of a man that has done so much in just a short period of time Was Patrick unworthy of a picture or even the mentioning of his entire name The death of an exKlansmen got more coverage in the paper for heavens sake The Northern Star needs to rethink their priorities and responsibilities PERIOD

Rest in peace Patrick Stokes PERIOD You will truly be missed by all and will never be forgotten PERIOD

Stars judgement of newsworthy needs reassessment

I am really disappointed at the paper with the recent lack of newsworthy articles PERIOD

The things we need to or should know are getting little attention PERIOD There are small articles in the paper where we have to search so deeply that when we find them it is like we have struck gold PERIOD It is very ironic that Patrick Stokes made headlines in other states even on the news but here at NIU the only info given was his last name and the fact that he died PERIOD Thats pretty cold PERIOD Stokes was an NIU senior trying to do something with his life PERIOD Now today in the paper you have his whole name and all the information after its complained about PERIOD Must the NIU students have to demand real news Under his picture is a huge picture of people at a sporting event PERIOD Which is more important The thing thats sarcastically funny is that my father not an NIU student knows more about what is happening to the students here than I do PERIOD Show some respect without it having to be forced out PERIOD

Star staff needs to refocus attention to student issues

I have recently become very disappointed in what the Northern Star has started to represent PERIOD One would think that by looking at a universitys campus paper one would have a pretty good idea of what events are going on at the school and what topics are important to those students PERIOD However I have come to notice when it comes to practically any minority issue it seems to be only onesided recently PERIOD I cannot even begin to comment on the topics about Greek life PERIOD I think there should specifically be a reporter for either Greek life or minority affairs and if there already is they are not doing their job PERIOD For example this past weekend was the Alpha Phi Alphas Miss Black and Gold pageant PERIOD Did I see one goodsized picture or a nicelywritten article about it Absolutely not PERIOD Sadly NIU has lost another life to an act of violence PERIOD Was there a fullsized article in respect to this life No PERIOD What is truly going on because it does not look like even this paper knows PERIOD

Huskie buses unreliable measures to fix problem should be taken

I was late to class for the eighth time today due to a tardy bus PERIOD The Huskie buses are supposed to come every ten minutes but I have found that is hardly ever the case PERIOD I have timed the buses on several occasions and have found that the buses come at random times everywhere from four minutes apart up to twentyplus minutes apart PERIOD Students rely on these buses to get to class work and other events PERIOD When they dont come on time students are at risk of being denied entry to class and missing out on important lectures as well as other things PERIOD As the weather gets colder the buses become increasingly more crowded PERIOD Students now not only have to worry about their bus being on time they have to cross their fingers that there will be enough room for them on the bus PERIOD More needs to be done to ensure the reliability of the bus system PERIOD The bus drivers need to communicate more PERIOD Regulations on how long bus drivers should wait at various stops should be made and perhaps more buses should be purchased to accommodate the student body PERIOD
