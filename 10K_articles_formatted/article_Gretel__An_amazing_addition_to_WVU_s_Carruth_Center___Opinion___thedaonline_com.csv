Which new addition to West Virginia University loves to hit elevator buttons has already starred in her first movie salivates over Marilyns Meat Brownies and just turned  years old in August If you guessed Gretel you are correct PERIOD Did I mention she is part labradoodle

Gretel is the newest employee at the WELLWVU The Students Center of Healths Carruth Center PERIOD She specializes in anxiety and stress and adores meeting new people PERIOD

After being released from the Hearts of Gold service dog training because of her small size Gretel found another use for her easygoing and loving temperament making a flawless transition to a therapy dog PERIOD

Service dogs are trained to service only one handler and shouldnt be touched in public but as a therapy dog Gretel is available to everybody all the time PERIOD Most dogs can get tired of meeting people and getting so much attention after an hour or so but Gretel loves the attention and is described by Program Director Al Kasprowicz as tolerant of all people. she doesnt even mind being dressed up by people as you can see browsing her Facebook photos PERIOD

I met with Gretel in her natural environment hanging with her handler counselor Deborah Beasley PERIOD Just by entering the room she makes people smile Beasley said when I asked about Gretels role as a therapy dog PERIOD There was no way I could disagree watching the black and white dog lay happily at our feet PERIOD

The labradoodle has a mellow disposition but is extremely attuned to whats going on around her PERIOD She can be sleeping on the floor when a patient starts to cry during a session and Gretel will perk up and go to comfort them PERIOD

Some patients will pet Gretel for an entire  minutes  a great deal for both parties PERIOD She has even gone to judicial hearings for sexual assault victims helping to make things a little gentler PERIOD She likes to help PERIOD Most dogs do like to be able to do something PERIOD Its just a matter of communicating with them Beasley said PERIOD

Gretel doesnt just attend court hearings and counseling sessions PERIOD This is a pup who is constantly on the go even kayaking in the Chesapeake PERIOD She loves to swim and recently splashed around with her brother Brewster in Cheat Lake PERIOD Gretel plays with her Hearts of Gold friends on Tuesdays and has playdates with Brando on the Engineering campus PERIOD Shes even taking agility classes just for fun at the Kennel Club PERIOD

When the Carruth Center moved to the new Health and Education Building Gretel spread the news by starring in a short film on the WELLWVU website PERIOD The movie depicts Gretel racing from the old downtown location to the new one even using the PRT and pressing elevator buttons with her paw a trick called upup which she apparently loves PERIOD

Its fun  The Carruth Center does not have to be a place with terribly depressed and mentally ill people PERIOD We can lighten up a little bit and this can also be a place where people can be a little more positive and try to lighten the day Beasley said PERIOD

Kasprowicz said he agrees that Gretel is an invaluable asset to the University PERIOD Shes a great vehicle for students and so many can relate to her he said PERIOD Gretel reminds many people of their dog at home and can give people that sense of ease with just her presence alone PERIOD

Beasley said they are working on making trips to the Residence Halls with Gretel PERIOD Seeing the friendly labradoodle is an amazing way to comfort homesick freshmen who long for the pets they left behind PERIOD

There are many plans for Gretels future to help her interact with more students which is what she loves the most PERIOD Students can plan on seeing Gretel in the Mountainlair to help with stress during midterms PERIOD Its not real technical  she cruises around making people happy being lovable and she does it well Beasley said of the beloved pup PERIOD People say that dog is mans best friend and its hard to disagree when you realize the effect of the unconditionally loving and loyal animals on you after only a few minutes PERIOD Almost like babies dogs have the ability to make you smile just by looking at them PERIOD

I highly recommend meeting Gretel for yourself PERIOD She can be found Monday through Friday in the Carruth Center PERIOD You can also check her out on Facebook under the name Gretel at Carruth or at her Twitter GretelLabradoo PERIOD
