9452,1970-01-01,"mention the term mangames missed to a head coach in any sport and watch them cringe PERIOD Mention the term to Drexel mens basketball head coach James Bruiser Flint and watch his steely resolve deflect the pain PERIOD

He has been to that dark realm of coaching one too many times PERIOD This past week it reared its ugly head again PERIOD

Junior forward Kazembe Abif broke his hand in practice last week the team announced Friday evening in a statement and will miss  weeks effectively ending the big mans season PERIOD Abif was averaging . points and . rebounds per game and . points and  rebounds per game in his last three contests which ended up being the last three contests of his season PERIOD

It was a really disappointing year for me because I havent really been healthy all year Abif told Philahoops.com PERIOD To be getting healthy again after my knee for it to end abruptly like that its really disappointing. but theres no time for lingering on the disappointing in college basketball especially not in February PERIOD The Dragons had a game Feb PERIOD  versus James Madison University and Abifs place was taken  for good this time  by freshman forward Rodney Williams PERIOD

Williams took it upon himself to step up in Abifs absence going for  points  rebounds and four blocks for his first career doubledouble in a  victory over the Dukes PERIOD

It was an impressive performance from a player with impressive potential put in a tight situation PERIOD It was to speak in no uncertain terms the best game of his career PERIOD

It felt great Williams told reporters after the game PERIOD I knew with Abif out that it was going to be a big possibility for me to perform so I knew I had to crash the glass to help the team PERIOD A lot of it is being ready to score. and score he did PERIOD

Williams previous highestscoring game came exactly one month earlier Jan PERIOD  in an  road loss to The College of William  Mary PERIOD What held him back from hitting doubledigits that night was his foul shooting PERIOD

Saturday afternoon Williams ensured that wouldnt be the case PERIOD The freshman shot  from the field and nailed  foul shots doubling his career high for free throws made in a single game PERIOD His head coach took notice PERIOD

Honestly a lot of what he did today was he made foul shots Flint said of Williamss breakout game PERIOD When you make foul shots youre much more aggressive to the basket PERIOD You know why Because you know youre going to make them PERIOD If you miss them you know youre not ready because if a guy fouls you the other team knows Just foul him hes going to miss them. he made some foul shots he got some confidence and he finishes at the basket. flint acted characteristically subdued after the game but spoke volumes of what he sees in Williams with an anecdote from his old coaching days PERIOD

Had a kid on my team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst never ran a play for him Flint mused PERIOD Averaged  points and  rebounds PERIOD All confidence PERIOD Never ran a play for him PERIOD But one of the big things we talked about to him was Youve got to shoot  percent from the foul line. and he did PERIOD And now all of a sudden his points go up PERIOD Rodneys the same way. kitwana Rhymer was the 6foot10inch 256pound center who played under Bruiser Flints dutiful watch at the University of Massachusetts for three years until  when Flint left the program to come to Drexel PERIOD Flint may have been generous with Rhymers stats  the big man averaged . points and . rebounds during his junior season at UMass  but his point was evident especially after what he saw Saturday afternoon PERIOD

Rodney Williams can be the Dragons Rhymer down the stretch and into the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament PERIOD The Dragons will need him to continue to develop his game without seeing dedicated plays run for him since Drexels offense is heavily guardcentric for the time being PERIOD But playing with confidence Williams can be dangerous PERIOD

Hes one of the best finishers in the league if he gets it around the basket Flint said PERIOD He finishes the play. to observers of the rough talented freshman this has been clear all season long PERIOD And to paraphrase Kanye West he has the facts to back this PERIOD

According to HoopMath through Saturdays contest  of Rodney Williamss  shot attempts this season came at the rim on layups tipins or dunks PERIOD A teamhigh  of them came on putbacks three ahead of senior forward Dartaye Ruffin PERIOD And of those  shots at the rim Williams has converted  of them or  percent PERIOD

Its a fact Williams has been Drexels most talented finisher around the basket this season PERIOD

And as of late he has also been their most consistent finisher PERIOD With injuries to Ruffin and Abif sidelining them for two and six of the teams past  games respectively Williams has already taken on the brunt of the inside game PERIOD

In the last  games Williams has attempted  field goals Ruffin has attempted  and Abif has attempted  PERIOD Calculating for games missed Abif has attempted  shots per game in the Dragons last  Williams has attempted . and Ruffin has attempted . pERIOD

While Abifs absence will certainly be noted Williams has spent the last month of games filling in for Abif so well that hes become the teams most formidable offensive forward PERIOD The freshman is ready for Drexels stretch run to the postseason PERIOD The only question that remains is whether his 14point 10rebound performance was an anomaly or a sign of things to come PERIOD

Thursday nights  loss to the College of Charleston was indicative of little in either direction PERIOD The Dragons on the whole were unable to muster much offense  shooting . percent from the field  but Charleston shot a nearly identical . percent PERIOD

Neither team held a lead larger than six points throughout the bizarre game and the Cougars took a onepoint lead into the final minute of the contest eventually winning on a Willis Hall floater with . seconds to play PERIOD Chris Fouchs lastditch layup attempt bounced just long as time expired PERIOD

The Dragons play again Feb PERIOD  when they host the Hofstra University Pride   CAA at  p.m PERIOD",Williams has been key for menâ€™s bball frontcourt - The Triangle,Drexel University
