It was possibly the greatest photojournalistic moment of my life to date PERIOD

A photojournalist strives to capture that one moment in time where something interesting is happening  and on April   I caught one for sure PERIOD Ive captured others but few made me laugh until I cried like this one PERIOD

Strolling about shooting features a standalone photo like on page  I ran into a group of students with a rabbit suit a video camera and apparently nothing better to do than cavort around the HUB lawn stealing Frisbees and humping people PERIOD The real moment came when the rabbit happened upon another costumed character  and the blood drive bloodhound hasnt been the same since PERIOD

Having your photo in The Daily Collegian could be your  minutes of fame at Penn State and I could make it happen PERIOD However in my three years on the photo staff I have realized that not everyone really knows what it takes to land him or herself on the front page or the second or third PERIOD

Heres a quick primer of ways to get yourself in print  or to keep yourself out PERIOD

First do something PERIOD Its not every day we see a bunny humping the bloodhound and if we do see it were going to get pictures PERIOD Id much rather take pictures of someone hulahooping in Alumni Hall than Sally Q PERIOD Public walking down the street PERIOD Sadly we do run quite a lot of features of people studying PERIOD

Its a lot harder than you think to capture true greatness PERIOD If  other people are studying around campus and youre enjoying a game of croquet in front of Old Main Im going to be there PERIOD

Secondly my name is not  Yelling  as I stumble through the snow in twodegree weather carrying my 15pound camera bag is not going to lure me over to your lame football game PERIOD Maybe if you tried  Id stroll over PERIOD My picture is right next to this column and you have about three days to try this tactic PERIOD

Another keystone of photojournalism is that posing is not really allowed PERIOD That makes the picture what we call fake PERIOD So if Im roaming around the Phyrst on St PERIOD Pattys Day dont stop me arrange your  best friends in a semicircle and give me the thumbs up PERIOD Guess what  even if I do bother to snap the picture it will never run PERIOD

In that vein if you see me snapping away in your direction your best bet is to ignore me PERIOD

If you look fake its not going to work PERIOD If you stare at me its also not going to work PERIOD Just act normal PERIOD This is why I love babies and puppies they dont care that youre there PERIOD They are cute and dont stop picking their nose crying or blowing kisses whether being photographed or not PERIOD

The last hint I have is to not accuse me of breaking privacy laws PERIOD Im rather well versed in media law thanks to Martin Halstuk and COMM  PERIOD And if you get angry because I took your picture in the middle of a public street youre not as versed PERIOD

Any time youre on public property you can be photographed and it doesnt matter if youre picking your thong out of your butt making out with someone that isnt your girlfriend or sleeping in the HUB wearing an ROTC uniform PERIOD It can be published PERIOD

Im jealous of your being featured on the front page PERIOD Being the one behind the camera ruined my chances PERIOD
