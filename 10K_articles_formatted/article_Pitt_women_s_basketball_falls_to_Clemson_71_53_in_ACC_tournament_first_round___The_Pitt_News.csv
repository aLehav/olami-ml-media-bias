By  Mason Carter Staff Writer March  

With their season on the line Pitt womens basketball still came up short PERIOD

The Panthers1019  ACC hopes of an ACC tournament run ended on Wednesday falling to Clemson   ACC  in Greensboro North Carolina PERIOD After a disappointing year this loss will likely end the Panthers season as they are longshots to reach the NCAA tournament PERIOD

This game was the Panthers second time playing the Tigers this season PERIOD They lost their first game  in Pittsburgh on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Coming in as big underdogs the Panthers hoped to snag a major upset against a redhot Clemson team PERIOD Before coming to the ACC tournament Clemson won three of its last five games including an upset against No PERIOD  seed Florida State PERIOD

Pitt on the other hand had the opposite luck losing three of its last five games of the regular season PERIOD The Panthers are victims of close defeats losing eleven of their conference games by five points or less PERIOD

The first quarter was close featuring seven lead changes PERIOD After going down early in the first quarter graduate student guard Channise Lewis and sophomore forward Maliyah Johnson handled the scoring to help the Panthers take an  lead PERIOD

Following backtoback Tiger baskets off a turnover Clemson went into the media timeout with a  lead PERIOD But then Panther senior guard Dayshanette Harris went on a fivepoint run finishing a layup as time expired on the shot clock and a threepointer on the next possession PERIOD

The Panthers would eventually hold Clemson scoreless for the last five minutes of the quarter finishing with a  lead PERIOD

After a wellplayed first quarter the Panthers werent able to hold any of that success for the rest of the game PERIOD Clemson opened the second quarter on a  run as the Panthers struggled to hit a shot missing their first  field goals of the quarter PERIOD

Eventually Pitt scored its first points of the quarter with a pair of free throws from senior forward Amber Brown at the  mark PERIOD Brown would go on to hit the Panthers only field goal of the quarter  a layup with  left in the quarter PERIOD

Clemson entered the half with a secure  lead which wasnt threatened for the rest of the game PERIOD Pitts leading scorer at halftime was graduatestudent guard Channise Lewis with six points PERIOD Meanwhile senior forward Hannah Hank led for Clemson with  points off five for eight shooting PERIOD

Coming into the second half the Panthers repeated shooting struggles continued as they went on a drought for more than two minutes PERIOD Senior guard Daisha Bradford led all scorers in the third quarter with eight points after a quiet first half PERIOD After a rough third quarter for the Panthers Clemson went into the fourth quarter with a  lead PERIOD

The fourth quarter didnt see much change as the Panthers werent able to contain the Tigers and their shooting PERIOD But a threepointer from Harris and a threepoint play from Brown cut the Tigers lead to  PERIOD This deficit was the closest the Panthers came to catching up in the fourth quarter as Clemson quickly expanded its lead back to  PERIOD

Clemson cruised into a  win PERIOD The loss ended the Panthers hopes for an ACC tournament run and likely ended their season entirely PERIOD

Ultimately shooting cost Pitt PERIOD The Panthers shot . from the field as they just werent able to knock down shots PERIOD Also Clemson picked apart the Panthers zone defense having assisted  of their  field goals PERIOD

As Pitt struggled to shoot Clemson took advantage of its open shots knocking down a tournamentrecord  threes out of  PERIOD Clemsons shooting combined with  turnovers was too much for the Panthers to overcome PERIOD

Brown who finished with  points  six shy of the  point career mark  led Pitt PERIOD Meanwhile Harris finished with  points in the last game of both players college careers PERIOD Hank who finished with  points and seven rebounds led Clemson PERIOD Bradford also had  points six assists and four steals  an allaround impressive stat line PERIOD

Clemson will face No PERIOD  seed North Carolina on Thursday at  p.m PERIOD If they dont reach the postseason the Panthers finish the season with a  overall record with some questions to answer about the future of the program PERIOD
