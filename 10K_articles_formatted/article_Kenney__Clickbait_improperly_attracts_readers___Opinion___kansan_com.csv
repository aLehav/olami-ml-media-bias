News is rapidly moving to the web PERIOD Newspapers are hopping online and searching for new revenue streams PERIOD As paywalls fail and sites compete for clicks article accuracy is losing out to a need to provoke readers into reading PERIOD

Banner ads have lost their effectiveness PERIOD Everyone and their mom knows clickable ads could contain a virus or at best just another ad PERIOD That realization has sent advertisers and websites scrambling PERIOD

The buzzword of journalists everywhere these days is native advertisement where publications disguise advertisements as articles PERIOD While a bit shady sponsored content is usually marked as such albeit in subtle ways PERIOD Clickbait is anything but PERIOD

Clickbait takes many forms PERIOD Some websites write their headlines to be as inflammatory as possible PERIOD Other sites make a controversy out of speculation stretching the meaning of reporting the facts to its breaking point PERIOD

In the wake of Robin Williams death an article on Gene Simmons made rounds PERIOD He was quoted time and time again telling depressed people to kill themselves PERIOD Though incredibly insensitive and poorly timed he made the comments nearly two weeks before Williams had passed PERIOD Dozens of news sources characterized Simmons comments after the fact for no reason than to drum up controversy and thus clicks PERIOD

Clickbait listicles and slideshows with new slides on its own webpage are just some of the ways that news sources are clawing at revenue wherever they can PERIOD Every piece of news is becoming more about its click potential than anything else which means reporting the facts takes a backseat PERIOD

As more and more Americans realize that TV news is a biased wasteland theyre turning to the Internet as their primary news source PERIOD But with the advent of ad tactics like clickbait theyre hopping out of the frying pan and into the fire PERIOD

The power of a news publication is in the trustworthiness of its name PERIOD When recognized and established papers post articles theyre obviously given more credence than JoeShmoe.com PERIOD When those same publications begin to post cheap articles aimed at provoking someone into a click the whole system suffers PERIOD

Real news sponsored news and clickbait will begin to look more and more similar until there is no real difference PERIOD Every post will be a political rant disguised as news PERIOD The news will become one longform advertisement and the actual runofthemill news will get drowned out PERIOD

Its hard to find someone to blame for this collapse PERIOD While newspapers and news sites are guilty of these tactics theyre only a natural response to how modern America consumes news PERIOD

While pinning blame is a challenge finding a solution is even harder PERIOD It seems impossible to change the American need for indignation PERIOD Being constantly angry with some politician or news event seems to have become a national addiction PERIOD Even if we found out how to curb that need back its still only treating a symptom PERIOD

The best way we can move forward is to treat every news article as clickbait PERIOD Recognizing these changes and keeping them in mind is essential to cut through the various layers of bias and advertisements PERIOD Likewise checking multiple sources should be the standard PERIOD Ensure that the news article you just read isnt simple speculation and exaggeration PERIOD Treat every news source even those youve read for years with a renewed critical mind PERIOD
