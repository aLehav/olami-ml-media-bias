Ive never had an original thought in my life PERIOD

Okay maybe once or twice but I assure you those were complete accidents PERIOD As a product of a public school system Ive been taught to regurgitate not learn PERIOD Ive been passively instructed to superficialize not internalize PERIOD I am a perfectly crafted standardized test taking machine even after all these years PERIOD

Its not braggadocio of course PERIOD After all here at Sacramento State we all strive to become innovators not automatons PERIOD That means retaining the information doled out during hourlong lecture classes and applying it PERIOD Moreover it means thinking creatively PERIOD

In essence a college student must strive to become what former United States Secretary of Labor Robert Reich called a symbolic analyst. reich defined a symbolic analyst as a person whom can identify a problem and solve it as well as strategically prevent further problems from occurring PERIOD

These skills are required by almost every job a college student could ever imagine filling from artistic professions to highlevel government positions PERIOD Even though disparate these jobs hold at least one thing in common a certain importance of understanding and manipulating symbols to achieve a goal PERIOD

Its obviously easier said than done PERIOD But as a student these skills become a part of basic survival PERIOD Anyone who has taken an upper division class can tell you that plainly PERIOD The closer to graduation the more interpretation and application skills are demanded PERIOD A student has to be able to master these skills and still thats only part of it PERIOD After all seeing what others overlook means nil if you dont do something about it PERIOD

So naturally as important as it is to think creatively unique ideas are just driftwood without the hard work and effort required to see them through PERIOD After all ideas arent endangered there are plenty to go around PERIOD Determination is at the real heart of any personal success we all cant be blessed with that one miraculous idea that will put us in the history books PERIOD

Often this means going above what is expected which is one form of creative thinking combined with extended effort PERIOD

In journalism it often means hunting down every possible source discovering every possible angle and reporting findings in a manner as simply as possible PERIOD Frankly its a stressinducing process PERIOD And for those of us who have adopted a sense of slacker fatalism birthed from whatever kind of personal background it can be a huge obstacle to overcome PERIOD

Still the results can be more than mildly rewarding PERIOD Sure theres the praise adulation a good grade or the hefty bonus PERIOD But perhaps most satisfying is you also get the intense pleasure of completing something worth your pride PERIOD Those things dont come often PERIOD Relish them when they do PERIOD

Great ideas are not doughnuts on some obscure conveyor belt that if found can be snatched up eaten digested and defecated into pure gold PERIOD The seed begins as the ingested external stimuli that fly around us the good and bad PERIOD An actual expressed idea is just a combination of the stimuli on the top of the proverbial dung heap along with some serious hard work PERIOD

Or to paraphrase graphic designer Milton Glaser life and personal expression can be boiled down to a series of influences PERIOD Be careful of what you eat then and know that even with a full stomach youre only halfway to success PERIOD
