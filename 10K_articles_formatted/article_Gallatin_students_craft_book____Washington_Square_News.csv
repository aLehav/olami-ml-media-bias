Ten people can be shown a painting and come away from it with ten very different perceptions PERIOD Two Gallatin sophomores Sophie Epstein and Emily Jampel are working to preserve this aspect of art through a book they are creating titled White Rabbit. it is designed to be an interactive 3D art book with compilations of work from artists ages  and under PERIOD All pieces have literary and philosophical themes behind them and are intended to challenge the viewers ideas and reactions PERIOD The pair cultivated the idea to create the book while they were taking a class dedicated to changing perspectives PERIOD

We were in  a class called The Social Construction of Reality Jampel said PERIOD It featureda bunch of concepts like art history philosophy gender activism consumerism publicity and just a lot of different takes of  changing your way of seeing. the Gallatin freshman seminar reads various texts from Plato to Herman Melville to examine the concept of reality and how it is developed PERIOD

After that class we knew we wanted to do something more with those themes Epstein said PERIOD

Part of their inspiration for White Rabbit stemmed from wanting to create art that had more substance than art they were used to PERIOD

We were a little frustrated with the art we had been looking at that it wasnt very substantial Epstein said PERIOD We wanted this book to show readers out of Platos Cave and apply that idea to our generation. artists were given a quote or an aspect of a book and then asked to create a piece of art in response PERIOD

The book will be a kind of artistic guide or starting point for others to discover and engage in various types of thoughtprovoking perspective changing ideas reflected in art Jampel said PERIOD

Epstein and Jampel got to work right away to make this dream a reality PERIOD Along with funding from Gallatin School of Individualized Study the two created a campaign on the popular crowdfunding website Indiegogo PERIOD The campaign offers different rewards for different donation amounts PERIOD A  donor received a bag of dirt while a custommade pill necklace is still available for a  donation PERIOD

We have a timeline drawn out between our team and we told Gallatin wed have it by January Epstein said PERIOD The book will be printed and then the galleryopening will be January or early February. with the physical plan to make the book a success Epstein and Jampel really wanted to focus on White Rabbits concepts and messages PERIOD

The overall goal was just to encourage people our age to really engage with texts around them Jampel said PERIOD We just want people to be more openminded and to be exposed to new ways of seeing the world we live in. a version of this article appeared in the Monday Sept PERIOD   print edition PERIOD Email Molly LeGrow at emailprotected PERIOD
