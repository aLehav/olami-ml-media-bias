The Erie Art Museum has always lived up to its mission of providing art education and development in the Erie area PERIOD

The museum encourages art in all its forms and that statement shines through in the new Art of the Comic Book Original Works from Klaus Janson John Totleben and the Museums Collection exhibit which will be on display until Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

For years comic book pictures and covers were not considered art PERIOD Very few people viewed comic book art as a financial investment or fancy collection PERIOD

Critics considered this form of art pretty low and it definitely was not regarded as art museum worthy PERIOD

However John Vanco past director of the Erie Art Center believed the works of comic book artists deserved to be marveled and exhibited in a museum PERIOD

Vanco spent a long time searching for original comic creations PERIOD From the time Vanco attended ComicCon where he met and acquired an original cover of The Spirit from the artist Will Eisner he has been able to collect works from the 1940s to the 1980s creating the museums small collection of comic book art PERIOD

The Art of the Comic Book exhibit displays pieces of earlier comic book art with original works from Totleben and Janson PERIOD

Totleben was wellknown for his artwork in the DC comic book story Swamp Thing but he also created the artwork for Marvels famous Spiderman. janson was an artist for both DC and Marvel Comics but is best known for his inking abilities PERIOD He added the final touches to each comic by using ink pens or brushes to embellish the outlines of each picture before it was copied and distributed PERIOD

The museum has a variety of classic comic book tales from genres like horror and crime to famous superhero stories PERIOD

Everyone is sure to find a comic they know PERIOD Katie Getson a freshman physician assistant major said she enjoyed the exhibit and seeing how the comics have changed since the 1940s PERIOD

At the end of the exhibit is a create your own comic station PERIOD Rachel Loper a freshman criminal justice major said it was her favorite part of the exhibit because it helped to get her creative juices flowing PERIOD

Her comic The Adventures of Rachel Women was a short onepage journey of Rachel Womans rise to being a hero PERIOD

Heidi Maule a freshman criminal justice major said that it was harder than she expected PERIOD

You dont realize how much creativity goes into just one page of a story Maule said PERIOD I expressed my own thoughts and thats when I really started to enjoy it. the Erie Art Museum is located on East Fifth Street between State and French streets PERIOD

The museum is open from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD on Tuesdays through Saturdays and  to  p.m. on Sundays PERIOD

Admission is free on Wednesdays or  for students on every other day PERIOD More information can be found at erieartuseum.org PERIOD
