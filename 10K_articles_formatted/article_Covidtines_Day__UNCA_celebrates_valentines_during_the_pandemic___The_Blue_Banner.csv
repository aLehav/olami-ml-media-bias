A gathering of usual Valentines Day gifts used to celebrate the holiday PERIOD

Abram Carter  emailprotected News writerFebruary  

The Valentines Day holiday looks different from the previous years with an increase in online dating sites and a decrease of people becoming romantically involved during the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

Its a day other than the story of Saint Valentine to be showing love and appreciation for anybody and everybody in your life whether that be romantic or platonic said Eevee Perozzi a junior at UNC Asheville PERIOD

With the pandemic looming over Valentines Day couples attempt to show their appreciation for one another through different ways PERIOD

Stephanie Wiener a current senior at UNCA said the holiday should still be something to celebrate even during the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

This holiday is meant for couples PERIOD Your significant other is already in your COVID bubble so there is no new risk Wiener said PERIOD Most singles dont go looking for a partner on Valentines Day. singles are not the only ones who do not usually show interest in Valentines Day as there are couples who do not see the hype and choose not to celebrate PERIOD

I dont really celebrate the holiday because my husband believes that showing appreciation to me everyday is better than just one day said Michelle Bettencourt a faculty member in the Spanish department at UNCA PERIOD

While the day serves as a romantic holiday for others it represents a day of selfrelaxation PERIOD

I am going to get a nice big tub of chocolate fudge ice cream and sit on the couch or bed and watch Howls Moving Castle and go to bed content Katt Snyder a single freshman at UNCA said about her holiday plans PERIOD

There have also been new ways to meet with and see others for those who are interested in romance PERIOD

Various avenues for interactions include creating a Zoom call using virtual gaming or even downloading a bunch of different dating apps to meet new people PERIOD

I use Bumble and I technically use Tinder but I have it more as a joke but Bumble is interesting it keeps proposing romantic things and people and even Tinder has romantic mode which is stupid cause I dont like Tinder Snyder said PERIOD

While some use a plethora of dating apps others choose not to and instead spend the day with their partner PERIOD

I am in a three and a half year relationship and so Ive never personally used a dating app but I know that some people find them helpful PERIOD Ive heard that Asheville Tinder is pretty dry though said Faith Shaughnessy a senior at UNCA PERIOD

Along with this rise of online dating an anonymously run Instagram account called unca.dating provided students with another way to find a relationship before Valentines Day PERIOD

It seems like a new way to find a space to hookup Wiener said PERIOD

Information about the account remains scarce as students question the true intentions of the account PERIOD

From what Ive heard and seen about the UNCA dating page it would probably be a better deal to just get a hotel room Shaughensssy said PERIOD

According to the CDC even though COVID19 cases are decreasing  thousand more deaths are expected before Feb PERIOD  PERIOD This can be a cause of concern for those looking to travel or go places before or on the romantic holiday PERIOD

At this stage I think the only change may be if some people used to travel to celebrate they may not this year Perozzi said PERIOD

Despite the numbers travel remains a point of interest for some PERIOD

Bettencourt said with the pandemic still present holiday plans may fall short for some depending on where they reside or go PERIOD

I think because of COVID it depends on the community you live in PERIOD In Asheville Ive seen a lot of people out and about lately mainly at restaurants Bettencourt said PERIOD

As the romantic holiday remains uncertain for some Wiener said pricing for holiday themed gifts can be frustrating PERIOD

Just because its in a heart shaped box and there is less candy doesnt mean the price should be increased Wiener said PERIOD

Even though the candy is expensive now it is expected to be on sale Feb PERIOD  PERIOD also known as National All Singles Day PERIOD

I am excited for chocolate to be on sale because I am a broke single chocoholic college student Snyder said PERIOD
