The evening began with an address to congress by the President PERIOD In his historic speech he spoke of the new war that our nation is facing PERIOD This somber note began the benefit concert Thursday night at the Drama House PERIOD Hopes were high for the event but what actually transpired was more powerful than anything we expected PERIOD

The concert featured student acts which included poetry readings and live performances PERIOD The event came to halt when security came and found one of the band members of the group  Energy with a beer PERIOD

The band member was not allowed to stay in the Drama House which presented a major problem because the band could not perform without him PERIOD

Eventually the show continued outside after students hauled long orange extension chords out of nearly every window in the Drama House PERIOD  Energy performed their long awaited set in the fraternity quad PERIOD

The band was barely visible  a single bare light bulb and the orange haze of streetlights lighted the quad PERIOD

The band member caught with the alcohol apologized to the crowd for the delay and then opened up with Nirvanas In Bloom. this version had slightly amended lyrics to make light of the alcohol incident PERIOD

It was this night that my generation was redefined in my eyes PERIOD The soundtrack of our teenage years played in the background as we stood outside in the dark together facing the sobering reality of war PERIOD

It is rare that students come together on this campus to fight or support anything PERIOD

Its unfortunate that it often takes something as tragic as the events of Sept PERIOD  to motivate people to work together PERIOD Students have supported each other during this difficult period to help others PERIOD

The benefit raised over  but more importantly it made people realize that they are part of more than UR but a community of American youth PERIOD

URs new alcohol policy threatened to stop the fundraiser because a student caught drinking a beer was not allowed to stay and perform with his band PERIOD

Last year this would not have happened  the student would have been written up and had his beer confiscated PERIOD

Thankfully this incident did not stop the show PERIOD It ended up creating a powerful experience PERIOD Nearly  college students stood sidebyside in the darkness in defiance of Security and support of people in need PERIOD

Sept PERIOD  and URs response to it has been incredible PERIOD This one evening though was the strongest showing of strength that I have seen yet on this campus PERIOD
