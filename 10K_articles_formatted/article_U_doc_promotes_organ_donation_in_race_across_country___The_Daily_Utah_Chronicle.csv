Avid sportsman and prominent U transplant physician Terry Box will be participating in one of the most rigorous bicycle races in the world the  Race Across America PERIOD

He and seven fellow friends and physicians plan to bike the more than 3000mile route from Oceanside Calif. to Annapolis Md. in less than  days with the goal of promoting organ donation and transplantation PERIOD

Their race begins Saturday PERIOD As a whole the team will race  hours a day until they reach their destination taking turns in 30minute shifts PERIOD

This ambition was motivated by an incident in  PERIOD Box found out he had a tumor in his liver and was in urgent need of an organ transplant PERIOD Fortuitously they found a donor and the doctor found himself on the operating table where many times he was the one holding the scalpel PERIOD

In  when Box finally made a full recovery from his successful transplant he made an oath that his lifestyle wouldnt be negatively affected PERIOD

I knew if I got a transplant I wouldnt let it slow me down a bit Box said in a statement PERIOD

Like many of the patients Box has treated he hopes to demonstrate his fortitude in RAAM PERIOD

I also felt I owed that to my donors family he said PERIOD

Box is a key member of his chosen charity Team Donate Life an organization that promotes organ donation and transplants also nationally recognized by the moniker The Liverators. he and the organization have been involved in RAAM since  and have managed to raise thousands of dollars for the cause according to a U Health Care press release PERIOD

In the past four years of the races history the RAAM racers have together raised a total of more than  million for their causes PERIOD
