According to the report he was wearing a loose fitting shirt and pajamas pants or sweatpants when he carried out the attack PERIOD

According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center thirddegree sexual assault constitutes penetration and can include force or coercion and victim incapacity PERIOD

Melissa Overton University deputy chief of police said the alert was sent out once the survivor filed a report and DPSS subsequently assessed the threat level to students PERIOD

Different people react differently to trauma and so once she did bring it forward we had to do a little bit of further investigation before we determined that there was a possible public safety threat and so thats when we determined to issue the crime alert Overton said PERIOD

Overton also said DPSS is still investigating and will be working closely with SAPAC to connect the survivor with resources she might need PERIOD
