According to Urban Dictionary the foremost source of words and phrases otherwise unavailable toAccording to Urban Dictionary the foremost source of words and phrases otherwise unavailable to people under  syllabus week is the first week of class when syllabi are passed out  a basic waste of time. true enough PERIOD But what will class look like once the awkward introductions are over and we can no longer just ritualistically read syllabi Students should have an answer to this question before adddrop ends PERIOD Pitt has this information but isnt willing to share it with students PERIOD

Pitts Office of Measurement and Evaluation of Teaching OMET keeps track of student evaluations of teacher performance PERIOD Although professors are not required to most sign up to give students an opportunity to honestly and anonymously share their opinions of their courses PERIOD These evaluations typically ask students to evaluate whether the instructor stimulated my thinking evaluated my work fairly and presented the course in an organized manner. at the end students can write freely in sentences instead of selecting prewritten responses PERIOD

This is exactly the kind of information students should have at their fingertips when registering for courses PERIOD Students who are interested in squeezing every last bit of value out of their undergraduate educations should have the option of being selective in the quality of teaching they seek out PERIOD Many students do this anyway but the first two weeks of class are often a busy and lessthanideal context to seriously evaluate professors before its too late to drop and try to catch up in another course PERIOD

Imagine knowing in advance what a particular professors strengths and weaknesses are based on dozens or even thousands of students before you PERIOD You could select classes that have particularly stimulating discussions or brilliant lectures PERIOD You could take courses that are geared toward your particular learning style or disability PERIOD

From a student perspective this seems like a nobrainer but faculty might be less likely to think releasing this information within the Pitt community is a good idea PERIOD A brief perusal of Ratemyprofessors.com is probably all the evidence the faculty needs to be wary of making their evaluations available to students PERIOD Although sites like Ratemyprofessors.com have a tendency to attract only the most glowing or outraged assessments of professor performance a more representative sample would likely crowd out such obvious response biases PERIOD

If students know their responses will be seen by peers instead of disappearing into the offices of deans and department chairs they will be more likely to give meaningful feedback PERIOD Better student feedback wouldnt just benefit students who want to find good classes it would raise the quality of undergraduate education across the board PERIOD

Teachers who routinely get negative feedback would be more likely to get help from Pitts Center for Instructional Development and Distance Education CIDDE to improve their teaching PERIOD CIDDE offers a variety of resources to improve teaching  including workshops and consultations  that would undoubtedly be used at a greater rate if student surveys were available within the University community PERIOD

There is however some troubling research that suggests student evaluations are significantly influenced by faculty grading PERIOD This can be especially detrimental to undergraduate education because nontenured faculty have an incentive to obtain glowing student assessments even at the cost of intellectual rigor PERIOD To combat this problem Pitt should explicitly require students to give reasons for their assessments PERIOD Student evaluators who dont adequately support their assessments would be ignored PERIOD The committees responsible for granting tenure and hiring new faculty are surely capable of weeding out responses that dont meaningfully evaluate teaching PERIOD Moreover student evaluations should only be one of several ways teachers are evaluated PERIOD Senior faculty department chairs and CIDDE consultants should also be responsible for giving teachers feedback on instructional quality PERIOD

Pitt would hardly be a pioneer if it chose to change its policy PERIOD Tulane University of Maryland Carnegie Mellon Duke Rutgers Georgetown and Johns Hopkins all release at least pieces of their student evaluations PERIOD Most of these schools release them on their university Internet portals so they are not available to the general public PERIOD Some schools even offer incentives for students to fill out teacher evaluations PERIOD At Maryland students must fill out evaluations in order to access other student responses PERIOD Tulane wont let students see their grades until their evaluations are complete PERIOD

Since Pitts teaching evaluations will increasingly be administered online students will have even more time to thoughtfully respond instead of rushing to fill them out at the end of a class period PERIOD We should take this opportunity to promote a more open attitude toward teacher performance by letting students at least see the raw quantitative data from their peers evaluations PERIOD Even though Pitt is often slow to change University administrators and faculty might be comforted to know that once universities make student evaluations public they almost never look back PERIOD According to several faculty and administrators at CMU once a college decides to give students this information it just becomes part of the culture PERIOD

The explicit theme of Pitts selfstudy submitted to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is using a Universitywide culture of assessment for continuous improvement. if Provost Patricia Beeson is serious about promoting an open honest and inclusive culture of assessment she should lead Pitt in joining many of our peers in the effort to make teaching evaluations available to students PERIOD
