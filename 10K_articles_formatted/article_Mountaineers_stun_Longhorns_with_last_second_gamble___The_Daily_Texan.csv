5966,2023-07-11,"texas fans screamed as they saw Devin Duvernay striding toward the end zone begging and pleading that Sam Ehlinger noticed the wide open receiver PERIOD

He did PERIOD Fortyeight yards later the cannon sounded the majority of the  fans at Darrell K RoyalTexas Memorial Stadium erupted and Texas took a  lead in the later stages of the fourth quarter PERIOD

But there was one problem Texas left  on the clock with Will Grier one of the best quarterbacks in the country waiting to take the field on the West Virginia sideline PERIOD

I wasnt hooping and hollering at all defensive end Charles Omenihu said PERIOD I knew who was on the other sideline PERIOD My only mindset was that we had to finish this game. then Grier showed the entire state of Texas why he is commonly regarded as a firstround pick in next years NFL Draft PERIOD

Grier took the field and led the Mountaineers to the Texas  yard line with  seconds left in the game PERIOD Longhorn fans held their breath as Grier dropped back and released the ball toward the end zone PERIOD

The ball sailed over Caden Sterns and Josh Thompson and right into the hands of Gary Jennings Jr. who planted his left foot in the end zone for a touchdown PERIOD Texas fans stood with their hands on their heads anticipating overtime PERIOD But West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen already knew he wanted to go for the win with a twopoint conversion PERIOD

Before lining up Holgorsen looked at Grier and asked Hey you want to win the game Lets go win the game. it was an easy decision PERIOD If you put the fate of the game in No PERIOD 7s hands I feel pretty good about it Holgorsen said PERIOD We had that decision made before we even took the field PERIOD We executed a twominute drive scored a touchdown PERIOD The decision was already made PERIOD Weve had this twopoint conversion in our back pocket all year. the gutsy call paid off PERIOD Grier took the snap and instead of airing the ball out as he did all day for  yards he took off PERIOD The Longhorn defense failed to contain him and he bounced outside easily finding the corner of the end zone PERIOD

Griers score gave West Virginia a  lead with  seconds remaining and he made sure to flash the horns down before capping off a lastsecond victory PERIOD

After the game Texas head coach Tom Herman approached the podium and summed up the aftermath of the nearly fourhour game with one sentence Were hurting in there emotionally and physically. texas loss not only dashed its hopes of making the Big  title game but it also featured several injuries PERIOD The Texas defense saw defensive end Breckyn Hager go down with a dislocated elbow defensive lineman Marqez Bimage leave with a dislocated shoulder cornerback Davante Davis suffered a sprained shoulderneck and safety Brandon Jones sustained an injury in what Herman described as a freak deal at the hotel Saturday morning PERIOD

While Texas tried to handle its injury bug the West Virginia offense and offensive line didnt miss a beat even after Mountaineerleft tackle Yodny Cajuste was ejected from the game for unsportsmanlike conduct during an extra point in the first quarter PERIOD

Grier and the Mountaineers racked up  total offensive yards PERIOD Despite giving up  yards worth of penalties West Virginias  rushing yards combined with  through the air were just enough for the onepoint victory PERIOD

He Will Grier got hit one time Omenihu said PERIOD Im not used to that PERIOD I havent been used to that all year especially with that other tackle not being in the damn game. another stellar performance from Ehlinger was overshadowed yet again by another lastsecond defeat PERIOD The sophomore quarterback accounted for  yards through the air  on the ground and four total touchdowns PERIOD

When the clock hit triple zeros though it was the Mountaineers who celebrated on the Longhorn logo as players ran around the field waving the West Virginia state flag PERIOD

I really just hate for our offense to go out there and play the game that they did they played a heckuva game and us defensive back PJ Locke III said PERIOD As a defense we couldnt stop the run like we should have PERIOD We didnt get takeaways and at the end of the day those things play a big role in the game. texas has now lost three games by a combined nine points PERIOD The Longhorns are still in the hunt for a conference title as they prepare for a trip to Lubbock for a matchup with Texas Tech PERIOD

The silver lining is that we play in the Big  and everybody plays everybody Herman said PERIOD Were not out of any race at this point PERIOD We certainly dont control our own destiny PERIOD We need a couple of things to happen PERIOD But at the end of the day our program is built on going  and we didnt get that done tonight. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Mountaineers stun Longhorns with last-second gamble â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
