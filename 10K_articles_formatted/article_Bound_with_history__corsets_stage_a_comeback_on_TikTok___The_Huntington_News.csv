The corset has become a modern symbol of sexual empowerment PERIOD

Annetta Stogniew news correspondentFebruary  

GenZs favorite source of information TikTok has crowned this winters ultimate fashion trend the corset PERIOD

A trend often associated with confinement may seem out of place in a time charged with hope for freedom of the future PERIOD But after months spent exclusively in loungewear it makes sense that society is ready to squeeze into something new PERIOD

Today with the pandemic and everyone wearing sweatpants its all about the contrast PERIOD Thats what fashion is about the new thing the next thing the opposite of what were wearing now said Frances McSherry a professional costume designer and teaching professor in Northeasterns theatre department PERIOD

Many TikTok users attribute their love for corset tops to the Netflix period drama Bridgerton. however the undergarments worn in the show are not conventional corsets PERIOD

Victorianera corsets which cinch the waist are often considered archetypal corsets PERIOD The Regencyera shapewear seen in Bridgerton instead flattens the torso and accentuates the chest PERIOD

The corsets that trend today are not particularly similar to Regency or Victorian corsets PERIOD

Maybe the modern corset needs a better name or a different name PERIOD Maybe its emerging as a different garment PERIOD Maybe it needs to be redefined  theyre not corsets of the old days theyre certainly not as confining McSherry said PERIOD

McSherry explained that trending corset tops are similar to bustiers which are strapless tops meant to push up the breasts PERIOD

Bustiers take the boning aspect of a corset  and make it a trendy and fashionable bra said Jennine Abramsky copresident of Northeasterns Fashion and Retail Society and a thirdyear student majoring in business administration with a minor in global fashion studies PERIOD

The major similarity between the classic corset and the modern bustiercorset hybrid is the supportive boning seen in both garments PERIOD

McSherry explained that the most likely cause for corsets intermittent comebacks since the 1970s is the support they provide PERIOD

We love structured garments that we can feel on our torso she said PERIOD It empowers us to stand up straight and to feel the strength of the chest the heart the lungs PERIOD Its kind of like armor. modern corsets also differ from the historical undergarment because they are not worn as an undergarment at all PERIOD In outwardly displaying a clothing item that has been hidden for centuries contemporary corset wearers demand attention PERIOD

In the Victorian Era dress reformers would claim corsets deprived women of control over their body and style PERIOD The modern corset offers its wearers this very control PERIOD

A corset is an undergarment so when we wear it on the outside we see it as a sexual object So if you walk out in a corset in public  youre taking your power and your sexuality back said Shae Warman shaetalksfashion a TikTok creator who makes fashion history videos PERIOD Even though its a constricting garment its not constricting our sexuality. warman explained the choice to wear a corset  something that was once considered a societal standard  exemplifies the freedom of fashion expression in the modern world PERIOD

Choosing to wear something just because someone wants to wear it Not having that choice I think thats the sign of oppression or forced femininity and modern corset wearers are taking that back and doing what they will with it Warman said PERIOD

In the past the corset was rejected as a tool to promote a uniform body standard PERIOD But today wearing a garment that is considered out of the norm like a corset can be an expression of individuality PERIOD

Wearing a corset as a shirt its kind of like a counterstatement to whats normal and accepted Abramsky said PERIOD

The confidence and sense of individuality that come with wearing a corset may have given the trend a bad name PERIOD People are sometimes uncomfortable with atypical fashion and the empowerment it can provide so they reject the garment or the person wearing it entirely PERIOD

In my opinion peoples problem would be that corsets are underwear that people are wearing on the outside not so much that theyre breaking in the female body and distorting womens organs Abramsky said PERIOD

Warman explained that the corsets association with femininity may also contribute to its negative reputation PERIOD

Society has a tendency to demonize things that are feminine or perceived to be feminine Warman said PERIOD Telling women that women used to be impossibly thin that really wasnt as common as we think. fainting weakened abdominal muscles and malformed internal organs were once attributed to prolonged use of corsets PERIOD But these and other negative health effects associated with corsetry were usually the result of a practice called tightlacing PERIOD

Tightlacing pulled in the waist to unreasonable measurements PERIOD It was common practice only among aristocrats for a brief period of time PERIOD The corsets connotations with femininity sexuality and control of ones body are more likely the cause of its notoriety than any supposed side effects PERIOD

Corsets may never have been as dangerous a clothing item as they are often perceived to be and the corsetbustier currently in vogue is no cause for worry PERIOD McSherry said any previous physical side effects of corsets are unlikely to make a comeback PERIOD

Its not a bad idea to have those stories in the background to make sure we never go back again PERIOD Its good to know but the times are so different  Women have really kind of taken control of their bodies and fashion and what it is that they wear McSherry said PERIOD Because of that I dont think we could possibly go back to what it used to be. mcSherry also explained the benefit of corsets relationship to the vintage thrifting trend PERIOD

I hope that more and more people take up the passion for thrifting upcycling recycling and sustainability because its truly the only way forward she said PERIOD And if it takes a corset to interest somebody in something thats used or something thats existed in the past I think thats a great thing. contemporary corsets exemplify freedom of expression for wearers PERIOD In modern fashion they are a symbol of liberation rather than confinement PERIOD

Its like an ode to a past life PERIOD I think coming out of quarantine is a big cause of that PERIOD We had no freedom so people are just yearning for this other time  So thats why theyre really getting into corsets its the idea of a simpler time Warman said PERIOD I dont think corsets will ever leave the consciousness of people PERIOD I dont know if well ever see them fully go away. may   Jessica Silverman
