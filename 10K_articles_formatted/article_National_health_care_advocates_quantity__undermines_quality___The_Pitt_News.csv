When Lyndon B PERIOD Johnson signed Medicare into law July   skepticism was immediately omnipresent among the American public PERIOD Simply put the bill was just too complicated for many people to comprehend PERIOD

As a result the public naturally clung to the talking points and rhetoric spewing from the media at the time in order to formulate their opinions on the bill PERIOD For instance the American Medical Association called it the beginning of socialized medicine and politicians warned of the inevitable army of eligible senior citizens busting down hospital doors as a consequence of the expansive program PERIOD An apprehensive polarized Congress and their constituents braced in apocalypticlike fashion for the day these benefits would become available for seniors PERIOD The start of the rollout was coined Mday by the New York Times in  PERIOD Many of the same tactics have been employed in the rhetorical war over the Affordable Care Act PERIOD

The Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is an inherently different story but there are parallels such as the comparable rhetoric which includes a similarly polarizing effect and the almost identical worries e.g. the long lines and Uncle Sam prying into our doctors office PERIOD

Unlike Medicare however the Affordable Care Acts rollout has been anything but smooth PERIOD

With many having trouble gaining their promised benefits on a severely broken website alongside others losing their coverage the program has already been marred soon after its commencement PERIOD But if anything the rollout of Medicare should provide some historical context PERIOD

When Mday came it was rather anticlimactic PERIOD Of the  million seniors eligible for health care  percent enrolled in the summer of  PERIOD But the long lines never came and hospitals braced for the worst only to find their pessimism met with a surprisingly smooth rollout PERIOD There were some bumps in the road for instance some hospitals in the South refused to hand out the benefits to eligible blacks PERIOD Nonetheless today Medicare is an extremely popular program PERIOD Most Americans expect to reap the benefits and no politician would ever dream of cutting it  so eventually the program was deemed worth the cost PERIOD

Although Medicares smooth rollout set it on a path toward success the initial quantitative problems with the Affordable Care Act can be easily overcome at least in comparison to the troubles the rollout poses in terms of quality of care PERIOD

On the aforementioned issues the rollout has already faced President Barack Obama assured in his endoftheyear press conference that a couple million people maybe more are going to have health care on Jan PERIOD . this claim is backed by rising enrollment numbers on Healthcare.gov and by widespread registration found in the new State Health Exchanges PERIOD For example New York state has had more than  people sign up for coverage with about onethird signing up for Medicaid and the remaining twothirds selecting private insurance PERIOD So while many other state legislatures are still squabbling over expansion New York state officials say they are on track in reaching their goal of having . million state residents insured by the end of  PERIOD

Furthermore the Obama administration has acted on the fact that many lost their insurance at the beginning of the rollout by temporarily canceling the individual mandate for those whose plans were rescinded PERIOD Thus giving the government the chance to smooth out the threshold of the mandate PERIOD

The numbers are improving and that is a big deal as Obama said PERIOD Some hospitals across the nation might agree that it is a big deal but not nearly with the same level of optimism PERIOD

There still exists a very dramatic concern  similar to the one that existed during Medicares inception  that the rollout will cause an influx of patients who will overwhelm hospital staffs across the country PERIOD Doctors such as Jeannette SouthPaul of UPMCs Matilda Theiss Health Center in Oakland have voiced such concerns PERIOD

Were going to be inundated with patients she said PERIOD With more than  uninsured people living in Western Pennsylvania SouthPal claimed there simply arent enough of doctors for UPMC to be fully prepared for the rollout PERIOD Other doctors believe these worries are exaggerated PERIOD

Dr PERIOD C PERIOD Richard Schott a Philadelphiaarea cardiologist and president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Its very unlikely that  million people are going to instantly appear on the doorsteps of physicians across the country as of Jan PERIOD . he went on to clarify this nothing that Historically people in this country and in this state have had access to care. sick patients have always come to hospitals with or without insurance and hospitals will not house patients with minor injuries or illnesses for longer than necessary PERIOD

Even UPMCs executive vice president and chief medical and scientific officer Dr PERIOD Steven Shapiro agreed PERIOD

Were not expecting too much of a difference in admissions Shapiro said PERIOD

The expected quality of care however poses a different story PERIOD

I spoke with longtime pediatrician Dr PERIOD Giuseppe Lancellotti on the subject PERIOD Lancellotti runs a private clinic in the rural town of Ephrata Pa. and makes rounds in the pediatric wing in the local hospital there PERIOD

When asked about the rollout he predicted that overall the quality of care is going to go down due to the weakening of accessibility between doctors and patients. he blamed this on the large medical bureaucracy he sees growing from the rollout PERIOD

Nonprofit hospitals are merging with forprofit hospitals creating bigger and bigger health systems he said PERIOD

Consequently this means that hospital administrations will have control over a greater number of doctors PERIOD

Whats happening is that you have some decisions leaving from the doctor and transferring to the administrator Lancellotti said PERIOD

He cited the Bundled Payments aspect of the Affordable Care Act as an example PERIOD Bundled payments are federal payments that care providers receive based on certain diagnoses of patients PERIOD

The administrators of hospitals decide how to divide these payments and a lot of it is just going right back into administration fees. the doctors arent seeing a lot of it he said PERIOD

Administrative fees could include the mandatory shift toward electronic health records in hospitals which is pretty big investment for many hospitals despite federal incentives PERIOD

As a result according to Lancellotti Productivity will go down because doctor incomes are going down  as is the time spent between the patient and the doctor due to these electronic medical records. the Affordable Care Act seems to cast a dehumanizing effect upon doctorpatient relations and even if millions obtain health insurance this possibility could undermine its value PERIOD

If future Americans are to look at the Affordable Care Act in the same way that we look at Medicare now the rollout will have to seriously overcome the problems facing quality of care as well as quantity PERIOD At this point however time will prove to be more telling than the rhetoric PERIOD
