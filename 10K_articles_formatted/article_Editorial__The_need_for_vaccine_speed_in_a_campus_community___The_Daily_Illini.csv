There have been  reported cases of mumps in Champaign County as of Aug PERIOD  making this the largest mumps outbreak in a decade PERIOD

While number of cases has grown since June  when  cases were reported the University and local Champaign health officials are concerned that the infection may spread further PERIOD

Although the University requires all incoming students to receive a vaccine for measles mumps and rubella health officials have found that most of the mumps cases found among students have already received the vaccination at least once PERIOD

Therefore McKinley Health Center and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District are working together to keep the outbreak under control PERIOD

Its crucial that students receive their vaccinations PERIOD McKinley offered two free allday vaccinations Aug PERIOD  and  and McKinley Health Center continues to offer the booster for those who did not attend the clinics PERIOD



The University is using its resources to make it easy for students to get their vaccines and avoid spreading the infection PERIOD Taking advantage of the offer is essential in such a highly populated environment PERIOD

According to the University students who are at risk of infection as a result of exposure to the virus or who lack adequate vaccination protection can be restricted from activities within the campus  including class other events and housing PERIOD

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one dose of the MMR vaccine is about  percent effective at preventing the disease while two doses of the mumps vaccine is  percent effective PERIOD  Considering the terrible social and physical consequences mumps can cause there is no excuse to avoid a vaccine largely effective in preventing the virus PERIOD

From coughing sharing eating utensils living in close quarters or even touching surfaces without washing hands are all methods of spreading and contracting the virus PERIOD

All of the patients in this outbreak so far had minor flulike symptoms and swollen salivary glands PERIOD While most are University students some patients are from the nearby community PERIOD

For those students who are rushing or plan to live in congregate living arrangements such as dorms or fraternity and sorority houses the third dose of MMR can be especially helpful in controlling the mumps outbreaks from spreading even more PERIOD

Washing your hands maintaining cough etiquette and staying in distance from those who are sick are simple ways to help manage this illness from spreading further but students need to make sure to take the most important step Get the vaccine in the first place PERIOD",Editorial: The need for vaccine speed in a campus community - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
