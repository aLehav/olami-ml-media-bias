Biological aging clock constructed with protein levels in blood

By measuring the levels of different proteins circulating in a patients blood Stanford researchers can use  proteins as a biological clock to estimate age found a study published on Dec PERIOD  in Nature Medicine. weve known for a long time that measuring certain proteins in the blood can give you information about a persons health status  lipoproteins for cardiovascular health for example neurology and neurological sciences professor Tony WyssCoray told Stanford Medicine News PERIOD But it hasnt been appreciated that so many different proteins levels  roughly a third of all the ones we looked at  change markedly with advancing age. the findings suggested that physiological aging does not occur at a steady pace throughout ones life PERIOD The protein levels in the blood remain constant but will suddenly increase or decrease depending on the stage of life PERIOD The researchers identified three points in time in which the levels of these proteins change dramatically PERIOD On average the time points were at   and  years old PERIOD

The blood analysis needs only a drop of blood to measure the levels of protein PERIOD

After nine or  proteins adding more proteins to the clock improves its prediction accuracy only a bit more WyssCoray told Stanford Medicine News PERIOD With machine learning you could potentially make a test with good accuracy based on just those nine proteins. new generation of cells combat blood cancers

A new generation of chimeric antigen receptor Tcells CART has been developed by Stanford researchers in an effort to combat against blood cancers as cited in a study published on Dec PERIOD  in Nature. the CART cells were studied in mice with human leukemia and bone cancer cells PERIOD

Led by pediatrics and medicine professor Crystal Mackall the team is interested in developing genetically engineered cells that will not be exhausted after its initial activity PERIOD The current treatments involving CART cells are effective in the shortterm but CART cells cannot divide and attack cancer cells continuously longterm due to cell exhaustion PERIOD

We know that T cells are powerful enough to eradicate cancer Mackall told Stanford Medicine News PERIOD But these same T cells have evolved to have natural brakes that tamp down the potency of their response after a period of prolonged activity PERIOD Weve developed a way to mitigate this exhaustion response and improve the activity of CART cells against blood and solid cancers. the researchers used a genetic technique called Assay for TransposaseAccessible Chromatin using sequencing ATACseq to determine differences in gene expression activity between exhausted and healthy Tcells PERIOD They found exhausted Tcells had activity of a family of genes that regulate protein levels in cells and these proteins inhibited Tcell activity PERIOD

Those of us in the CART cell field have wondered for some time if these cells could also be used to combat solid tumors Mackall told Stanford Medicine News PERIOD Now weve developed an approach that renders the cells exhaustion resistant and improves their activity against solid tumors in mice PERIOD Although more work needs to be done to test this in humans were hopeful that our findings will lead to the next generation of CART cells and make a significant difference for people with many types of cancers. global carbon dioxide output reaches alltime high

Fossilfuel carbon dioxide emissions will reach an alltime high on a global scale with carbon dioxide output expected to reach an estimated . billion U.S PERIOD tons this year according to Stanford scientists from the Global Carbon Project PERIOD Findings also suggested that the rate of emissions growth has been slower than the previous two years PERIOD

The three studies were published on Dec PERIOD  in science journals Earth System Science Data Environmental Research Letters and Nature Climate Change. when the good news is that emissions growth is slower than last year we need helpearth system science professor Rob Jackson told Stanford News PERIOD When will emissions start to drop

The researchers found that the United States European Union and China contribute more than half of all global carbon dioxide emissions PERIOD Additionally they found that while coal use has been decreasing in the U.S PERIOD and E.U. natural gas use has increased over the last year PERIOD

We need every arrow in our climate quiver Jackson told Stanford News PERIOD That means stricter fuel efficiency standards stronger policy incentives for renewables even dietary changes and carbon capture and storage technologies. contact Derek Chen at derekc8 at stanford.edu PERIOD
