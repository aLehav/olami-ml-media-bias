3695,2015-09-21,"i was once a Gamecock at the University of South Carolina also known as USC PERIOD To my friends at the University of Southern California the real USC was established as a university before California was even founded as a state. with SEC football Greek Life and southern tradition transferring from a school like USC to Boston College was a huge transition PERIOD

Some say that size doesnt matter but it matters a lot for college students PERIOD An individual who went to a large regional high school would probably be better prepared to thrive at a massive state school such as USC PERIOD The guy who went to a relatively small boarding school in New Jersey however would definitely say that bigger is not always better PERIOD

Immediately after transferring to BC I was shocked by the difference between SEC and ACC football PERIOD First students down at USC always dress up for the home games PERIOD Guys wear polos and buttondowns while girls generally wear black dresses and cowboy boots which are excellent for sneaking mini bottles of liquor into the stadium PERIOD

The Gamecocks football arena known as WilliamsBrice Stadium is also a behemoth of a venue PERIOD To put things into perspective its capacity is nearly twice the size of Alumni Stadium and even dwarfs Gillette Stadium by about  seats PERIOD Attending a football game there was akin to the atmosphere of an NFL playoff game and more like the Super Bowl when South Carolina pummeled the Georgia Bulldogs ranked sixth and fifth respectively back in  PERIOD

That is not to say however that Alumni Stadiums smaller size detracts from the overall experience at BC PERIOD Obviously BC would have no use for a stadium that fits  students and more importantly the smaller size allows students to recognize and find each other PERIOD

BC makes up for its lack of relative size in its close proximity to one of the largest cities in the United States PERIOD We truly have the best of both worlds when it comes to size and location PERIOD When oncampus activities dont suffice one can make a quick commute into Beantown via Commonwealth Ave PERIOD or the Green Line PERIOD Between visiting notable museums to supplement traditional classroom learning and helping others through service programs such as 4Boston BC students have a growing list of activities to enrich their collegiate careers PERIOD

Going to school in Columbia SC brings many of these same perks but on a much smaller scale PERIOD Columbia is approximately onefifth the size of Boston and a large portion of that population comes from the  undergraduate students. in addition to football Greek Life had a very significant presence at USC PERIOD For anyone who has seen Animal House or Old School fraternities and sororities are frequently associated with the traditional college experience PERIOD Although many of my friends at different universities pledged during freshman year I did not take advantage of my triple legacy at Kappa Sigma fraternity for reasons that stem from my early decision to transfer PERIOD After all who wants to endure weeks of pledging without spending any time as a brother

Instead I explored other opportunities such as working for the schools top15 ranked newspaper The Daily Gamecock PERIOD I actually received a stipend for my work editing and writing for the news section since the newspaper is backed by the university PERIOD The Heights by contrast is entirely studentrun and its editors put in hours of work for no compensation at all PERIOD Despite the lack of monetary incentives I have a greater commitment to my work for The Heights because it doesnt feel like a job PERIOD On another note our newspapers independence provides more freedom which is important for news reporting and creating dialogue about controversial topics PERIOD

All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my study abroad trip down south PERIOD Transferring is commonly viewed as a mistake in choosing a college but I see it instead as a change of plans PERIOD Attending USC was everything I wanted it to be and more but at some point I simply changed my mind PERIOD This is not to say USC is an inferior school in any way but merely different PERIOD Also my transfer experience is just one of many PERIOD If you are lucky enough to meet another transfer student I encourage you to learn hisher story and celebrate why we love our alma mater PERIOD
