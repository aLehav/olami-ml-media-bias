Minnesota mens hockey defenseman Erik Johnson announced yesterday he will forego his final three years of eligibility to join the St PERIOD Louis Blues next season PERIOD

Johnson  who was selected No PERIOD  overall by the Blues in the  NHL draft said the decision was in the works for much of the week PERIOD

I informed Blues President John Davidson Tuesday morning Johnson said PERIOD They kind of had contract negotiations going on but I officially announced it yesterday. johnson said he couldnt discuss the specifics of his contract at this point but said it will be in the nature of a threeyear deal worth  per season with an undisclosed signing bonus PERIOD

In one season with Minnesota Johnson raised eyebrows with his sixfeet fourinch 222pound frame PERIOD His physical presence on the blue line and deep in the defensive zone gave the Gophers a boost in grittiness something they lacked in past seasons PERIOD

And with his keen sense for threading passes to forwards streaking up ice coupled with a nasty slap shot Johnson amassed four goals and  assists in his one season with Minnesota PERIOD

On the ice hes just a great competitor and brings that physical presence defenseman Derek Peltier said PERIOD Hes strong in his own end  hits and pins well PERIOD But he also sees passing lanes and has that booming shot. peltier who will be a senior next season was unaware of the move until yesterday afternoon but said Johnson will be missed on the blue line PERIOD

Other teammates contacted Johnson to wish him well PERIOD

A lot of them are really really happy for me Johnson said PERIOD Ive gotten calls from five or six of them. johnson felt similar sentiments toward his former team PERIOD

I had a tremendous time at Minnesota he said PERIOD It was one of the best teams Ive been on skillwise and with the coaches I had but I felt it was time for me to move on. though the move was expected coach Don Lucia said in a prepared statement that Johnsons departure is bittersweet. he said Johnson was one of the most talented defensemen hes ever coached PERIOD

Erik was immediately an impact player in our program Lucia said PERIOD There is no doubt in my mind that Erik will have a terrific career in the NHL. as a highly touted player at the Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield Johnson quickly moved on and made an impact on the U.S PERIOD National Development team based out of Ann Arbor Mich PERIOD

He decided to attend Minnesota instead of jumping straight to the NHL saying earlier in the season that he knew he wasnt quite ready for a leap to the professional ranks PERIOD

But after a season with the Gophers which included accolades such as being named to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association AllRookie Team Johnson said the time was right PERIOD

While Johnson became the first Gophers defenseman to pass up remaining eligibility for the NHL since AllAmerican Keith Ballard in  he might not be the only one to do so this offseason PERIOD

Defenseman Alex Goligoski and center Kyle Okposo are both likely candidates to leave early along with Johnson but neither has publicly made that decision PERIOD

If Goligoski and Johnson both go coupled with Mike Vannellis graduation Minnesota will lose its top three scoring defensemen PERIOD

Itd be fun to give other younger defensemen an opportunity to fill those roles Peltier said PERIOD Weve got guys itching to get that chance. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
