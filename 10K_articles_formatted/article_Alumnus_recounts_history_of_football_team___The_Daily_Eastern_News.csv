For Dan Verdun writing a book has been a goal since his undergraduate days at Eastern PERIOD

You have to come up with an idea that nobody has really done or you have to do something very well said Verdun the author of Eastern Illinois Panthers Football. verdun described his work as a combination of his interests which are sports and history PERIOD

The book is the second of a series that covers the history of smaller football programs at different universities in Illinois PERIOD

His publisher The Northern Illinois University Press preferred that NIU be the first book PERIOD

I definitely wanted Eastern to be the next book in the series Verdun said PERIOD

The book recounting the history of Eastern football in its entirety is the product of about five years worth of writing and research PERIOD

Verdun is currently a middle school teacher in Naperville. he graduated from Eastern in  with a bachelors degrees in history and journalism PERIOD

Its a story of the university and the people that made it up. verdun said PERIOD

With about  pages of text and more than  photos the book does more than just chronicle the history PERIOD He sees his book as a sharing of the story PERIOD

Verdun reached out to the Eastern offices and online resources for the records and archives to make sure he was able to list the most notable players and coaches throughout Eastern football history PERIOD The book goes on to recognize those who went on to play professionally PERIOD

One of the biggest challenges during the process of writing this book for Verdun was getting a hold of those currently involved with the NFL PERIOD

Each guy that I talked to was its own unique story. he said PERIOD

He also said Lou Stivers was an interview that stood out from the rest PERIOD

Stivers a World War II veteran residing in Charleston was a member of the Eastern football team in  PERIOD

Stivers received an offer to play for the Detroit Lions right after playing at Eastern PERIOD

At the time the money was not enough to keep him from getting his teaching and coaching career started PERIOD This was just one of many entertaining stories that were a result of hours of interviews PERIOD

Once I got Bob Spoo to do my Forward that opened a lot of doors for me. verdun said PERIOD

Verdun is currently working on books for Illinois State University Southern IllinoisCarbondale University and Western Illinois University PERIOD

He anticipates the next book of the series will be Illinois State or Southern Illinois. he feels people focus too much on programs from conferences such as the Big Ten PERIOD

There are a lot of terrific stories at schools like Eastern. he said PERIOD

Verdun will be joining Eastern for the Homecoming Week festivities Saturday when the Panthers host Tennessee State at  p.m PERIOD at OBrien Field PERIOD

He will be hosting two book signings PERIOD The first of which will be in the Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD University Union Book Store from  a.m PERIOD on Saturday PERIOD
