8618,1970-01-01,"the Ohms from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology won first place in front of  guests at the South Asian a cappella contest Sangeet Sagaar in the Talley Ballroom Saturday evening PERIOD

Sponsored by NC States Delta Sigma Iota Fraternity this was the first year that this type of event was held on the East Coast PERIOD

It had never been done by us and we didnt know how it would turn out but we just kept going with confidence and the result was pretty great said Akshay Iyer the events lead organizer and a senior studying electrical engineering PERIOD

The event helped raise money for Drive Education a nonprofit organization that works toward helping nearby schools improve education methods and Ekal Vidyalaya a nonprofit organization that aims to educate students in rural India PERIOD

A few months ago we decided we wanted to bring back all the things we love Iyer said PERIOD We love the community we love music and we love unifying the community PERIOD And tonight I believe we found the ingredients to bringing all the things we love together. many of the teams incorporated both Bollywood and American music into their routines and performed in elaborate costumes PERIOD

Some of the songs that were performed during the competition were popular hits such as Radioactive by Imagine Dragons Royals by Lorde Blank Space by Taylor Swift and Power Trip by J PERIOD Cole all of which were mixed with South Asian Bollywoodstyle music PERIOD

The six competing teams each performed three songs consisting of a mashup a ballad and a song of the teams choice PERIOD Dhamakapella from Case Western Reserve University came in second place after the Ohms from MIT PERIOD

The final act of the night was NC States own a cappella team the Grains of Time which was an exhibition act PERIOD The group performed popular hits such as Animals by Maroon  Centuries by Fall Out Boy and Problem by Ariana Grande to close out the show PERIOD

They did such an awesome job and I would say this was one of the best a capella events Ive seen on campus so far said Joshua Apke president of the Grains of Time PERIOD

Apke said it was amazing to see the event come together especially seeing how the competing teams mixed together the two styles of American pop and Bollywood music PERIOD

I definitely recommend people on campus checking out and getting involved in events like this Apke said PERIOD It was a onceinalifetime thing. three judges familiar with South Asian culture judged the performances John Caldwell a Department of Asian Studies professor at UNCChapel Hill Madhumita Saha a vocalist who trains others in Indian classical vocals and Afroz Taj a professor at UNCChapel Hill who teaches courses related to South Asian cultural aspects such as film media music and theater PERIOD
