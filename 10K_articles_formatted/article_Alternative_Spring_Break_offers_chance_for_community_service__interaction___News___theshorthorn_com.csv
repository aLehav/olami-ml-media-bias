Next March typical spring breakers may head to places like Cancun or Daytona Beach PERIOD

Alternative spring breakers however are packing their bags for Louisiana PERIOD

Alternative Breaks dating back as far as  provides students the opportunity to travel and participate in community service projects during academic breaks PERIOD

March  through  students will spend time in Baton Rouge La. helping communities affected by severe flooding which took place in August said Mark Scheldberg site leader and English senior PERIOD

The trip will cost  per student PERIOD The payment will cover transportation meals and lodging Alternative Breaks director Miriam Guerrero said PERIOD Students who want to get involved must apply online through the Leadership Center website by Sunday PERIOD

Guerrero said participants will focus on four different social issues homelessness hunger education and disaster relief PERIOD

We plan to help local nonprofit organizations in their fight against poverty by working at food banks homeless shelters and community centers Scheldberg said PERIOD

Since the flooding volunteer organizations across the nation have stepped up to bring relief to East Baton Rouge Scheldberg said PERIOD While the city is on the path to recovery there is still more work to be done PERIOD

Scheldberg said  percent of Baton Rouge residents live below the poverty line which is nearly  percent above the national poverty rate PERIOD Alternative Breaks members have discussed ideas to work with local youth organizations like the Boys and Girls Club since the flood damaged many public schools and disrupted their education PERIOD The students also aim to help construct and repair houses in local areas such as Denham Springs a city east of Baton Rouge where  percent of homes were flooded PERIOD

As a result of the presidential elections the media has not given Baton Rouge enough coverage so people may not really know how the community is doing after a natural disaster like that Guerrero said PERIOD

Our goal with Alternative Spring Break is to create conscientious active citizens that are compassionate caring unselfish and informed about the needs of our countrys communities she said PERIOD

Not only can students make a difference but this trip is also a great opportunity to form lasting bonds Scheldberg said PERIOD People from different religions majors and ethnicities all come together under a shared goal to bring some sort of positive change to the world PERIOD

Alternative Breaks is a unique program that allows participants to expand their horizons and open their minds and hearts to outside communities mathematics sophomore Joyce Hong said PERIOD

Hong will attend her third Alternative Breaks trip as a site leader this winter to Alexandria La PERIOD

Site leaders work with the Alternative Breaks director to coordinate the trip by choosing its focus and the volunteer sites Hong said PERIOD

The program helps shape people into more active citizens by letting them become part of a community different from their own for a week and volunteer while learning about different social justice issues Hong said PERIOD

Getting involved and helping the less fortunate may also provide new insights and perspectives on the larger picture Scheldberg said PERIOD Students will leave North Texas and their comfort zones to get a personal glimpse of issues plaguing society  issues they may not have confronted before PERIOD

Of course we wont eliminate these issues nor make a substantial dent in the course of five days but we will still make more of a difference than if we dont do anything at all Scheldberg said PERIOD
