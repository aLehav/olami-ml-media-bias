Houseasaurus is a nonprofit cooperative living community where people can come together to live and promote queer positivity social responsibility environmental sustainability egalitarianism and diversity Mojdeh Motamedi Houseasaurus board coordinator said PERIOD

The housing cooperative is open to both Penn State students and residents of the State College area and Houseasaurus has been in State College since  PERIOD

Since then Houseasaurus has acted as a safe haven for students searching for a positive accepting environment PERIOD

However Houseasaurus has recently experienced difficulty finding its safe haven a home PERIOD

It moved from its previous location to  W PERIOD Beaver Ave PERIOD this past summer but its current location is less than ideal PERIOD

Part of the reason Houseasaurus is a money issue right now is because we were forced to change houses Zachary Goldberg a Houseasaurus resident said PERIOD That move did not go too well and cost a lot of money PERIOD We werent at a great financial place to begin with but the move made it significantly harder. houseasaurus rushed move was caused by a  percent increase in rent at the nonprofits previous residence PERIOD

Motamedi graduatechild clinical psychology described the move as a rough transition for the cooperative living community had been located at its old address for  years PERIOD

There were not many people around over the summer to help with the transition and we lost a lot of house resources with the move Motamedi said PERIOD

Finding a home that is large enough to accommodate all members with a relator whose views align with Houseasaurus is posing challenges PERIOD

The house we were renting changed ownership to a large company and we wanted to change locations so we could have a landlord that we could have a personal relationship with and who better understood our commitment to building community Kyle Husmann a current Houseasaurus resident said PERIOD

The nonprofits current location is most likely temporary and the ultimate goal is for Houseasaurus to buy its own property PERIOD

Houseasaurus is raising funds to meet new house needs and to create more scholarships for lowincome students PERIOD

Were trying to raise  and we are currently  percent of the way there Husmann graduatehuman development and family studies said PERIOD

Goldberg stressed the importance of insuring funds for community living options in State College and is a big proponent of community housing. he views the solidarity of Houseasaurus as a great way to really reflect on your identity and live sustainably. we strive to uphold our shared values in the house and the surrounding community social responsibility environmental sustainability queer positivity and egalitarianism Husmann said PERIOD These four pillars are the common ground on which we base our decisions which we make by consensus. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
