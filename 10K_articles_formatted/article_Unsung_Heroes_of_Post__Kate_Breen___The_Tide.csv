Mary Kathryn Breen called Kate the secretary for the English philosophy and foreign languages department in the Winnick Mansion is an unsung hero dedicated to helping students PERIOD

Usually I wear the hat of problem solver she said PERIOD She learned this skill through her life and work and through parenting PERIOD Here I think all the staff is finding solutions to help the students and faculty achieve their academic goals she said PERIOD I always try to present a positive face of the department to anyone who comes in PERIOD With Dr PERIOD Lutz we do a lot of outreach to other disciplines and departments so we can help connect students. breen has held several jobs in addition to staying at home for  years when her children were younger PERIOD Immediately prior to working here at Post I was a library clerk on the Brentwood campus she said PERIOD Breen began working for the university in  while pursuing her masters in library science PERIOD In June  she came to assist Dr PERIOD Lutz and the faculty in the English department PERIOD

Breen loves her job because she finds a lot of variety in her work day and admires the people she interacts with PERIOD Every day is different and presents new challenges to assist people and to learn new software she said PERIOD The English department has been in the Winnick House approximately three years PERIOD Prior to that the department was in Humanities PERIOD A big part of my job has been to facilitate the move of faculty facilitate setup of the spaces in the Winnick House so that all the faculty offices run well and that the main office runs well. her work includes accounting for equipment and supplies as well PERIOD

Breen believes in the value of communication something she has developed while working with Dr PERIOD Lutz PERIOD We have to help keep all parties informed if there are student issues with the course the professors have to know she said PERIOD

Breen finds what she sees and what others may not notice at first sight valuable PERIOD As a small liberal arts university we offer so much to the students she said PERIOD So I always try to make students aware of additional opportunities to expand their experience. she wishes there was a scavenger hunt for every firstyear student so that they can find a different and perhaps lessfrequented area or department on campus PERIOD Some of my favorite spots are the gardens that Marjorie Merriweather Post planted the Reference Commons in the Library and one of my favorite artifacts is the large blackandwhite  aerial photograph of Long Island which is found in the Life Sciences hallway she shared PERIOD I think some of these things may be missed by students. breen is also fond of the architectural details history and visual backdrops throughout the campus PERIOD

Breens office is in the Winnick Mansion room  PERIOD Her office has an open invitation to students to come and visit any time. published in Features
