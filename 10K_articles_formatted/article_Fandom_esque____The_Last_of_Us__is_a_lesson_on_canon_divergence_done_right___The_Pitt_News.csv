I predict that next Emmy season HBOs The Last of Us will have a clean sweep  especially with its third episode Long Long Time. long Long Time like the rest of the series so far is an enigma in the long saga of adapting video games to film PERIOD Its really really good and even more so its taken extremely well to the path of canon divergence PERIOD

Really quickly canon divergence is primarily a fandom term used when fanfiction is set in a universe that diverges from the original canon due to changing a characters backstory or the plot overall PERIOD

Occasionally people use this term when talking about film and TV adaptations of work as well PERIOD Long Long Time is an example of canon divergence on film done to perfection PERIOD

The Last of Us  which I mentioned briefly in my last blog post  is a new show on HBO based on a video game of the same name PERIOD Both focus on Joel Pedro Pascal a smuggler in a postapocalyptic zombiefilled America who is charged with escorting a 14yearold girl named Ellie Bella Ramsey to the west coast PERIOD

Long Long Time doesnt really focus on them PERIOD Weird right After hearing so much about Pascals performance shouldnt the best episode be one where he and Ramsey are the main focus Well the scenes that theyre in are great but the bulk of the episode consists of a flashback between two side characters from the game  Bill and Frank PERIOD



In the game Bill is a libertarian crackpot survivalist who owes Joel a few favors and serves as a sort of pitstop in the gameplay for the player PERIOD Frank is already dead when Joel and Ellie arrive PERIOD The details are vague but what the player does know is that Frank suffered a bite from one of the zombies and killed himself before he could turn PERIOD

While its never explicitly said aloud its heavily implied that Bill is gay and Frank was his partner before they had a falling out PERIOD Ingame Ellie steals some gay pornographic magazines from Bill and Bill refers to Frank in passing as his partner. if the player searches they can also find a suicide note of Franks where he details just how much he hates Bill and sarcastically wishes him luck in the apocalypse PERIOD Their relationship clearly ended on a bad note PERIOD

In the show the story is much different PERIOD

In a 50minutelong flashback Bill  who Nick Offerman plays masterfully  stumbles upon Frank Murray Bartlett after he falls into one of his booby traps PERIOD Perhaps unwisely Bill takes Frank into his home for a meal before he plans to send him off to the Boston QZ or quarantine zone. but after Bill performs a novice but heartfelt performance of Linda Ronstadts Long Long Time on his piano Bill and Frank kiss and sleep together and it sets them on a path of partnership that will last  years PERIOD

I kid you not social media refers to the next  minutes of their flashback as the gay version of the first  minutes of Up. i have yet to find a better way to describe it PERIOD

hbo you have room to expand on bill  franks relationship

tlou writers WHAT IF THE OPENING MONTAGE FROM UP WAS AN HOUR LONG GAY AND DYSTOPICTheLastOfUs

Its a beautiful and heartbreaking episode of television where Bill and Frank make a life together in a miserable bleak world even when it doesnt seem like theres much to live for PERIOD Frank changes Bills entire perspective on life PERIOD Frank encourages Bill to want good things for himself  things as simple as friends good music or the joy of enjoying freshpicked strawberries with your husband on a summers day PERIOD

However all good things must come to an end and Frank gets sick with cancer PERIOD Undeterred Bill prepares to take care of him until he dies  but Frank wants to die on his own terms and asks Bill to slip sleeping pills into his wine so he can die painlessly PERIOD After spending one last day together Bill concedes to Franks request but also slips the pills into his own wine PERIOD

In Bills words Im old PERIOD Im satisfied PERIOD And you were my purpose. joel and Ellie find them both dead weeks later PERIOD

Long story short this pivot from the source material is a masterful choice that no sane person could complain about PERIOD

Craig Mazin one of the showrunners said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the episode was meant to serve as a break from all the action and tension of the first two episodes PERIOD

Weve just seen people who are scared who are in a dangerous place who are hiding or running or worried or being hurt or being killed in the first two episodes he said PERIOD I need something different now. changing the source material in a film or TV show isnt new PERIOD In fact its almost mandatory when adapting something to the screen PERIOD But The Last of Us is the only piece of media in recent memory that seems to have been universally praised for it PERIOD

I will admit that I love beating a dead horse but Game of Thrones really dropped the ball on many of its storylines  and Im not talking about the last season here PERIOD I mean storylines that George R.R PERIOD Martin had already written yet the showrunners chose not to include for whatever stupid reason PERIOD

Heres one example PERIOD In The Song of Ice and Fire series Dorne the kingdom at the very bottom of Westeros has a very central part in the series progression PERIOD Princess Arianne Dorne involves herself in a coup attempting to get Cersei Lannisters daughter Myrcella Baratheon on the Iron Throne PERIOD Ariannes brother Quentyn Martell goes to Essos in an attempt to forge a marriage pact between himself and Daenerys Targaryen PERIOD

None of that is in the show PERIOD Dorne has a small almost unimportant role in the later seasons serving mostly as a backdrop for Jamie Lannisters character development PERIOD Its also rather noticeable that Dorne is one of the only places in Westeros populated with people of color PERIOD

Theres a whole slew of other examples I could give but my point is that when it comes to adapting a work showrunners have an opportunity to make the source material even better PERIOD Everyone over at HBOs The Last of Us chose to focus on hope and love despite what homophobes spit on the internet PERIOD

Changing or keeping the source material to highlight the story of marginalized people in the long run is going to do your show more good than bad PERIOD When Nick Offerman walks off the Emmy stage with an armful full of trophies in his hands keep that in mind PERIOD

the last of us writers were like hey joel needs a car PERIOD what if we write the most touching and heartbreaking hour of television in the world
