We have a strong interest in Nebraskas surface Phillips said PERIOD



OSU players and coaches liked the feel of FieldTurf when the team played there last fall PERIOD



FieldTurf is relatively new to the market and has the look and feel of natural grass PERIOD

He is confident the money can be found for the project PERIOD



The cost of a new surface would range from  to  and installation would take about three weeks PERIOD



The existing AstroTurf has been on the field since  five years longer than the general length of time for a surface to last PERIOD



Slick spots fading pulled seams and holes became obvious this past year PERIOD
