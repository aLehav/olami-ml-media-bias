2194,2022-03-16,"going into Saturdays home doubleheader womens swimming thought it would be lucky to break even PERIOD But a breakout performance coupled with another strong showing from the mens squad helped the Maroons end their fall in lateseason form PERIOD

Taking on a pair of tough regional squads Chicago earned a surprise sweep as both teams upped their dual meet records to an impeccable  PERIOD The men trounced Lake Forest  and edged Grinnell  while the women drowned the Foresters  and pulled off a narrow 15point win over the Pioneers  PERIOD

For the women the victories marked the best start in school history and displayed the continued growth of a young program PERIOD The men matched their start from last autumn and both squads were powered by a number of personal and season best performances PERIOD

It was a great meet for the women PERIOD They were ecstatic head coach Jason Weber said PERIOD I think its a turning point for the program PERIOD It was a total team effort PERIOD I was very proud of them PERIOD A lot of girls were going for their best times PERIOD Usually you dont see that this early in the season. after falling relatively easily to Grinnell last season at MyersMcLoraine the women entered the meet with tempered expectations shooting instead for a win over the Foresters and good competition with Pioneers PERIOD Once the races actually started though all the odds and history between the two schools were swept aside PERIOD

Leading the way once more for the Maroons in her debut season firstyear Cassie ONeill won both breaststroke events clocking in at . in the  and finishing the  in . pERIOD Secondyear Sarah Laws did her part as well taking the  and 100yard freestyle races with times of . and . pERIOD

It was the more unexpected performances though that proppelled Chicago to victory PERIOD Displaying remarkable stamina as well as speed thirdyear Ellie McNeill was first to the wall in the  freestyle and jumped right back into the pool for the next race taking third . in the  freestyle to give her team some much needed points PERIOD Firstyear Kathie Ang chipped in with personal best times in the  and 200yard butterfly second in . third . pERIOD The meet will only serve to boost the young squads confidence as they make preparations for the second half of the season PERIOD

They were pretty excited said Weber who is in his first year at the helm of the swimming programs PERIOD I told them before the meet that if we get girls winning events and everyone scoring we can win this meet. while the men entered the day with higher hopes they lived up to their goals thanks to top times from some usual suspects PERIOD Thirdyear Zach Ergish who has been nothing short of dominant this fall continued to post impressive numbers with seasonbest performances in all three of his races PERIOD Ergish took first in the 100yard breaststroke . and in the  . pERIOD Secondyear Shane Carlson who put a big stamp on the record books last fall has been stretched out across different events this year with the emergence of firstyear distance swimmers Chase Bassignani Nick Trojanowski and Kenn Miller PERIOD While Carlson is swimming in different races the speed is still there and he took first in the  freestyle in . pERIOD

For the men overall it was probably the best showing the team has had all year Weber said PERIOD Both opponents were solid but the men sort of knew they could win easily so I challenged them PERIOD They had to win every event PERIOD And they lived up to that PERIOD It was the most dominant meet of the year and I think they can finish undefeated if they keep swimming like that. the early success comes as a welcome sign for a pair of programs that do not have lengthy histories of success PERIOD The Maroons will now have a welldeserved six weeks off from meet competition but the schedule wont get any easier from here PERIOD Both squads will travel to Sarasota Florida during winter break for a training trip before returning to action January  when they host the Chicago Invite PERIOD
