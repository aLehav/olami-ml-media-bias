It seems fortuitous and appropriate that opportunities like the panel discussion sponsored by student counselors of the Campus Life Assistance Center be made available PERIOD Open dialogue and expression of different perspectives is the nature of a university PERIOD

There is no singular position which can be expressed about the events of this hour where Penn State sons and daughters relatives and friends half a world way are engaged in military conflict PERIOD
