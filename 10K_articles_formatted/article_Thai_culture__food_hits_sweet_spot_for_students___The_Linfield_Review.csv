9056,2023-11-04,"thai Country is the type of restaurant that I could dine at two or more times a week and never get sick of eating it PERIOD The food is authentic and the service is warming PERIOD

One of the most admirable aspects of the restaurant in my eyes is the interior decoration PERIOD

You walk inside and immediately greeted by the Buddha women figurine in addition to the sweet and genuine servers PERIOD

The figure and the plethora of elephant dcor that can be seen all throughout the restaurant set the environment PERIOD

Elephants are the symbol of Thailand and hold a deep meaning to the culture PERIOD

The wallpaper elephant carved chairs and miniature statues all over the restaurant add to the cultural appreciation of elephants and any person walking into Thai Country will take notice PERIOD

Thai Countrys menu is made up a variety of veggiebased stirfry dishes and delicious curries PERIOD

Although I havent tried everything on the menu I cant imagine you could go wrong with ordering anything PERIOD

Another aspect that I appreciate about Thai food is since the food is heavily veggiebased PERIOD Vegetarians and vegans can enjoy just about anything on the menu PERIOD

In addition to this meateaters can also indulge in a meal that will satisfy their animalprotein craving PERIOD

Whether youre the pork beef chicken shrimp or squidtype all the plates at Thai Country give you those options to pick your poison PERIOD

Every time I eat here I discover new favorites PERIOD

This weeks picks were the Gang Ga Ree a hot creamy yellow curry with a generous amount of vegetables and the Pad Garlic steamed veggies with perfectly sauted mushrooms over white rice PERIOD

Again Ill reiterate my love for Thai Country being that you cant go wrong with ordering anything on the menu PERIOD

Coming from me that is a wonderful thing to be able to do putting trust into their menu and chefs because I am just about the most indecisive person to walk into their restaurant PERIOD

So when it comes to Thai Country not only is the food appealing and youll want to take in all that your stomach allows you but emphasize taking in your surroundings and appreciating the replicas of the Thai culture that is seen throughout the restaurant PERIOD
