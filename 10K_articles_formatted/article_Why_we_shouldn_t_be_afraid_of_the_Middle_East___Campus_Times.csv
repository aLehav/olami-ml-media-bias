What is the Middle East

It is a geographical region encompassing between  and  nations depending on whom you ask PERIOD It is the religious center of the world for roughly . billion people PERIOD It is a common catchword often associated by the media with violence oppression corruption and radicalism PERIOD

Unfortunately it is this third point which Americans most frequently remember when they hear or think of the Middle East PERIOD Owing to media stereotyping the majority of news coming out of the region focuses on its negative aspects such as violence and instability painting a picture of it for the American public as a dangerous and irrational place PERIOD

While there are indeed certain areas which travelers are advised to avoid northern Yemen central Iraq and most of Somalia for example such locations are grossly outnumbered by the many safe touristfriendly sites and cities one could easily visit ranging from Istanbul to Aleppo and Abu Dhabi to the Dead Sea PERIOD

Americans should not be afraid of the Middle East and they should avoid looking askance at it with a wary eye PERIOD Having spent the previous semester studying in Amman Jordan and having traveled over much of the region I was amazed by the boundless hospitality I encountered among the locals PERIOD The antiAmerican sentiment that is assumed to be so pervasive over there is largely an illusion created by individuals seeking to make a profit through controversial news PERIOD

As an example the widely broadcasted celebrations in the streets following the  attacks which were portrayed by some as the common sentiment across the region were actually only filmed in two or three locations PERIOD These films which sparked so much controversy and attention came primarily from Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza and Lebanon where celebrators were bribed to appear happy on camera PERIOD

Although some of those celebrating may indeed have been pleased they are hardly representative of the Palestinian Arab or Muslim people as a whole PERIOD As well broadcasting images of an Iranian cleric inciting crowds to chant Death to America death to Israel is far from a true representation of the Iranian peoples opinions PERIOD The largescale grassroots protests which followed the rigged  elections in Iran seem to be a far more accurate measure of that PERIOD

The majority of Arabs I interacted with while abroad became very excited when they realized I was an American and were quick to point out the difference between their disapproval of American foreign policies and their respect and admiration for the American people PERIOD They may not like our government but they like us PERIOD

The Jordanians I spoke with about this were well aware that they are not viewed very highly in the U.S. and frequently expressed their willingness to fix that image PERIOD Many Jordanians were ecstatic that we as Americans were willing to come to their country learn their language and endeavor to understand their culture PERIOD

Naturally it was very exciting for them to share who they are and what they have with outsiders PERIOD This innate fear Americans have of the Middle East is unfortunately holding us back from better understanding a rich complex and fascinating part of the world PERIOD

The myriad different peoples who live across the region are generally speaking very amiable and sociable PERIOD At the risk of sounding clich they are not so different from us PERIOD They play soccer PERIOD They enjoy good music PERIOD They write literature PERIOD They love hummus PERIOD

Although they do have a different belief system it is still founded on the same basic concepts of charity peace and respect preached by Judaism and Christianity and it emphasizes generosity and hospitality as lifelong duties PERIOD

In truth Americans traveling in the Middle East have relatively little to fear PERIOD Provided they travel with an open mind and flexible attitude they will be amazed at the warmth of the welcome and the breadth of the culture they are bound to encounter PERIOD The region and its people have much to offer and we as Americans have much to learn both from and about them PERIOD

Keep in mind that if you travel to Iran you may be held hostage especially if you are hikers or embassy workers PERIOD Also dont go to Lebanon if you are a college student especially American University in Beirut or you may be killed PERIOD And be careful walking around outside of Gaza with mortar shells raining down on the streets and Israeli airstrikes happening overhead PERIOD And if you like kissing your girlfriend in public the United Arab Emirates are out of the question unless you want to spend a month in jail PERIOD And if you are planning to be a reporter stay out of Iraq Afghanistan and Iran PERIOD And if you are a missionary then Iran and Saudi Arabia isnt for you either as you will be lashed and your bibles shredded PERIOD

If those things dont apply to you then youll probably be safe PERIOD

PS Those  celebrations took place across Saudi Arabia too which you failed to mention PERIOD Also opeds in Egyptian papers praising bin Laden got good marks from Egyptian Muslims PERIOD I know this because I have friends from over there who admit that many Muslims from all over the place did celebrate after  PERIOD

Keep in mind that if you travel to Wyoming you may get beaten up and tied to the side of the road especially if you are gay PERIOD  Also dont go to Chicago if you are a high school student especially a CPS student or you may be killed on your way to school PERIOD  And dont let your children out of your sight in a mall gas station front yard or bedroom unless you want them kidnapped and murdered PERIOD  Oh if you want to have a drink once youre  dont go to BYU PERIOD  And if youre Muslim stay out of Adam Ondos dorm room PERIOD

If these things dont apply to you then youre probably safe traveling the country PERIOD

PS Dont turn on the radio or Fox News because youll hear people celebrating about the Japan earthquake Hurricane Katrina or the attempted murder of a congresswoman PERIOD  I know this because I have friends from over here who admit that many conservatives all over the place did celebrate after all those tragic events PERIOD

Stop with your hate agenda Adam its disgusting PERIOD

See youre comment is the disgusting one PERIOD You pervert everything I say and label my comment as hateful when it clearly is not PERIOD Your examples arent government sanctioned like mine PERIOD My examples prove that there is strong antiAmerican resentment and antiChristian resentment in certain countries that this article tries to claim are safe for Americans to travel to PERIOD I pointed out the awful things that Muslim governments have done to tourists PERIOD You pointed out that criminals are bad PERIOD Your example was quite pitiful PERIOD

And not drinking isnt necessarily a bad thing PERIOD

PS IF you dont believe my comment take a box of bibles to Saudi Arabia and start handing them out in front of the police station PERIOD Then well see if Im exaggerating things PERIOD

Adam there is strong antiMexican antiimmigrant antigay antiwoman antiminority legislation being proposed every day by Republican governments in the midwest and South PERIOD  There is plenty of governmentsanctioned discrimination and violence here PERIOD  That doesnt mean that people shouldnt visit the United States and it doesnt mean that people shouldnt visit the UAE PERIOD  And not making out in public isnt necessarily a bad thing PERIOD

And I wouldnt start handing out bibles in Saudi Arabia because Im not an asshole PERIOD  The fact that you that and burning of a Koran is a reasonable thing to do further underscores how ridiculous and nonexistent your moral code is PERIOD

Im sorry spreading the gospel to every corner of the world is one of the main tenants of Mormonism PERIOD Why do you think were building temples in Nigeria and have them in Ukraine and Hong Kong and have a strong presence in El Salvador PERIOD Im sorry if you think fighting against evil and trying to spread the gospel makes ones moral code ridiculous and nonexistent because that just shows the world how ridiculous and morally corrupt you are PERIOD

Yeah spreading the gospel Adam isnt about standing in front of a police station in Saudi Arabia or is it and thats why the Mormon Saudi revolution has been so slow coming PERIOD  Its about speaking to people and talking to people as human beings not potential terrorists with respect about Jesus and God and the loving redemptive qualities of the Bible or has your laundry list of Vengeful God passages that youre handing out in front of Arab police stations an equally unsuccessful method PERIOD So yeah thanks for lesson but everything youve ever said here has proven exactly how morally bankrupt you are PERIOD  Maybe spend more time reading the Gospel PERIOD

Its hard to talk to people about things when the authorities are going to lash you and imprison you for being a missionary PERIOD It is Middle Eastern governments and politicians that are morally bankrupt Im one of the few holy people left PERIOD Luckily my persistence and will is much stronger than most and I dont fear death so in the end I will win and they will lose PERIOD They will know fear and the people they hurt will become the triumphant ones PERIOD Then theyll face their real judgment in a burning lake of sulfur and suffer for eternity thats what theyll get for lashing missionaries and supporting terrorism PERIOD

What you are ignoring is the fact that as a traveler in a foreign land you are expected to understand and respect the cultural norms and expectations of the society you are visiting irrelevant of whether or not you agree with them PERIOD  Assuming a culture is bad because of this or that tradition is a nave and boorish way of looking at the world PERIOD  One doesnt go to the U.A.E and kiss his girlfriend in public because that is not culturally acceptable just like one doesnt walk up to a kosher deli in Tel Aviv and demand a ham and cheese sandwich or walk into an American church service wearing a shirt with a vulgar image PERIOD  Understanding the culture and its taboos is your expected responsibility as a traveler no matter where you are PERIOD

As for your other claims easily  to  students from my study abroad program spent a significant amount of time traveling around Lebanon throughout the semester especially in Beirut and Tripoli without incident PERIOD  Some even spent the full  day vacation we had doing research there PERIOD  It is one of the most beautiful nations and generally speaking has one of the most liberal cultures in the Middle East PERIOD  Although a radical organization Hezbollah does hold a considerable amount of power in the country it is still a hugely popular destination for European and other Western tourists PERIOD  As well I dont understand how you could see the AUB as such a dangerous place when it has over  students many of them foreign and a very good track record of student safety PERIOD

If you plan on being a reporter in Iraq then that is a risk you willingly accept and you are incurring the same dangers that being a reporter in Chechnya the Sudan and certain areas of Mexico would entail PERIOD  They are all warzones PERIOD  Iraq is not special in that regard PERIOD

If you are a missionary then as I stated in my article you should read up on understand and respect the laws and traditions of whatever nation you plan on working in whether you agree with them or not PERIOD  Proselytizing is illegal in many nations across the Middle East and if you choose to do so anyway and are punished then you have noone to blame but yourself PERIOD

Traveling to Gaza or Iran right now is simply stupid and is not recommended by any Western government PERIOD  However if you choose to ignore the countless other places you could be visiting Syria Jordan Egypt Oman Israel Dubai Turkey and go there anyway then I sincerely wish you the best PERIOD  I personally traveled to Jerusalem and the West Bank namely Bethlehem and a Palestinian refugee camp and did not at any point feel unsafe or in danger PERIOD

Concerning the celebrations in Saudi Arabia following  and your proBin Laden Egyptians as I stated in my article they do not represent the Arab population nor the Muslim world as a whole PERIOD  You are going to find radicals in every society who celebrate violence and tragedies which the vast majority of citizens view as horrific PERIOD  The Ku Klux Klan is still a very powerful white supremacist group here PERIOD  There are still neoNazis in Germany PERIOD  Xenophobia has been on the rise in Russia PERIOD  That doesnt mean that the majority of Americans Germans or Russians are zealots racists and paranoid fools PERIOD  Just the ones who like to see themselves on the front page of the newspaper PERIOD

What you fail to mention is that if I asked for a ham sandwich in Jerusalem I would not be lashed for it merely ridiculed PERIOD That is why Muslim nations are barbaric PERIOD And AUB had three students killed there which is what I was referencing PERIOD Also reporters are respected in many war zones PERIOD Reporters even get interviews with the opposing side sometimes PERIOD Sometimes they are killed by accident as bombs and gunfire dont discriminate during a real battle but then you go to the Mideast and you get your head chopped off even when there is no battle going on and you are not a threat PERIOD That is unacceptable and violates international law PERIOD

Please link to any news articles that indicate that anyone has been lashed for asking for a sandwich in a Muslim country PERIOD

The point was that ham sandwiches arent comparable about kissing in public and handing out bibles because the latter will get you lashed PERIOD Thats why the ham sandwich was a bad example PERIOD

I did not mention that because it would not happen PERIOD  Your comments prove that you have never had any personal experience traveling in a Muslim country and that you are just using ridiculous stereotypes to make ridiculous arguments PERIOD

Concerning reporters you are giving the impression that every journalist in the ME is in danger no matter where they go which is nonsense PERIOD  The only journalist deaths in the ME this year have been in areas of conflict Iraq Tunisia Yemen Egypt httpen.rsf.org PERIOD  As well journalists are more likely to be in danger because they SEARCH FOR CONFLICT willingly putting themselves in harms way PERIOD  And as stated above that is the case in EVERY country not just in the Middle East PERIOD  Look up Anna Politkovskaya or Sean Flynn for more information PERIOD

Also unless you provide evidence that students were killed at AUB then readers here have no reason to believe you are telling the truth PERIOD

violates international law. are you kidding me And killing innocent people indiscriminately such as you seem to feel is acceptable is not a violation of international law What was it you mentioned a few days ago rollback At least pretend not to be a complete hypocrite who cant get their own head out of their ass PERIOD

Indiscriminately killing someone is not nearly as bad as targeting someone you know is innocent and should not be killed PERIOD If I throw a grenade at an enemy combatant and accidentally kill two civilians along with the enemy combatant that is okay PERIOD If I have a gun and shoot the enemy combatant and then proceed to shoot the unarmed civilians that is a war crime PERIOD Things like My Lai are atrocities because soldiers were targeting civilians while Hiroshima and Dresden are not because we couldnt very well program the bombs to only blow up who and what we wanted to destroy PERIOD

As for being a hypocrite look at the countries Im talking about PERIOD They shred bibles and think its okay but then we burn the Quran and apparently it gives them justification to kill people and riot PERIOD These arent people they are not logical thats why rollback is the only option PERIOD

So when Americans riot then they cease to be people as well and it becomes acceptable to use indiscriminate force to keep them under control",Why we shouldn't be afraid of the Middle East - Campus Times,University of Rochester
