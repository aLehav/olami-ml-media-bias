Dear Editor

I was very pleased to read your Sept PERIOD seventeenth opinion piece U makes the right decision on spouse cards and samesex partners. as an alumnus I happily endorse this step toward equity for samesex and oppositesex partnerships PERIOD This is the same level of respect I would want shown for my own chosen relationship PERIOD

In a pluralistic society the Golden Rule is still a sensible and sensitive touchstone PERIOD
