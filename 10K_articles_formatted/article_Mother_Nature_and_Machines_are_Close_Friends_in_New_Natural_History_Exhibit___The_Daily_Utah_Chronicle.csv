486,2023-10-23,"just as Schoolhouse Rock was the hub for the most underrated song lyrics of peoples childhoods nature is the most underrated foundation of hundreds of inventions that make everyones lives easier PERIOD The Utah Natural History Museum is introducing a new exhibit that ties together the mother of all invention  necessity  and the amazing feats of nature that inspired some of todays basic inventions PERIOD Natures Ultimate Machines opened Feb PERIOD  and will be available to guests until Sep PERIOD  to show just how often nature inspires modern mechanics PERIOD

Featuring over  specimens videos replicas and interactive displays the exhibit answers questions about a variety of technological breakthroughs and the inspiration behind them PERIOD Explore everything from the creation of Velcro to how woodpeckers are able to avoid headaches then discover how birds fly through the air and try it for yourself in a notsoeasy flight simulator PERIOD After your exploration  a quest that can be undertaken in both English and Spanish through the bilingual displays  discover how all of these things relate to the human condition PERIOD

Lindsey Reader a graduate student at the University of Utah who is studying climbing behaviors in birds recently visited the exhibit PERIOD

I like the mix of the interactive stuff the classic oldschool use of specimens and then the current applied robotics stuff Reader said PERIOD I think thats a huge strength of biomechanics is that  people ask Why do you do such basic work Its so that we can forwardengineer things later and invent stuff PERIOD Weve been taking inspiration from the biological world forever and hopefully putting it to good use. alicia Boynton also a graduate student at the U is studying concussions and how to make better helmets for football players PERIOD What natural inspiration is she using Woodpeckers PERIOD The length of their hyoid bone and tongue may hold the secret to improving football helmets and warning players of incoming impacts before they happen PERIOD

Woodpeckers can experience over  gs while theyre pecking at a tree and not have a concussion not pass out but humans can only withstand like  gs  times the weight of gravity before we pass out completely Boynton said PERIOD

Essentially as Schoolhouse Rock explains it in A Victim of GravityThe bigger the object the stronger the pull. humans arent made to withstand the large pull of gravity PERIOD

Were trying to look at woodpeckers and figure out how are they able to do it and how can we use that technology and those materials create something similar in human helmets to protect our heads Boyton said PERIOD

Thats just one practical use of one aspect of nature that humans use to make life easier but Natures Ultimate Machines is home to tons more PERIOD Learn about seeing with more than just your eyes and discover how the termite influenced architecture in this celebration of the amazing ways nature has encouraged technological advancement PERIOD The museum is free for U students faculty and staff with a valid university ID PERIOD
