In the pouring rain at a soldout FirstBank Stadium No PERIOD  Tennessee  defeated Vanderbilt   for the fourth straight year on Saturday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD The Volunteers had four secondhalf  yard rushing touchdowns and the Commodores struggled to move the chains PERIOD

Were disappointed right now PERIOD Tonight was painful PERIOD I just hurt for our team for our fans and for our program Clark Lea said after the game PERIOD We wanted the chance to extend our season and fell short but were gonna have a chance to step back and really take a big picture view PERIOD I can tell you that theres a belief and feeling internally that we are closing those gaps and we need to capture that sense of improvement and use that as fuel to just to continue to strive forward. after receiving the opening kickoff the Volunteer offense got right to work with a fourplay  yard touchdown drive taking up only  seconds of game clock PERIOD Quarterback Joe Milton III launched a  yard downfield pass to Jalin Hyatt that set up a Jabari Small 3yard run on the next play putting Tennessee up  PERIOD

Vanderbilt responded largely on the ground picking up  yards on six carries split between running backs Ray Davis and Patrick Smith PERIOD However a botched snap to quarterback Mike Wright set the Commodores back  yards that led to a punt pinning the Vols at their own  yard line PERIOD

As the downpour continued Tennessee kept the passing game going but their second drive stalled after only one first down because of overthrown throws from Milton III PERIOD

However the Commodores went threeandout and gave the ball right back to the Volunteers PERIOD

Tennessee went hurryup on the following drive facing a few moments of resistance from the Vanderbilt defense PERIOD The Volunteers though converted two crucial fourth downs including a fourthandgoal from the 1yard line to go up  just before the end of the first quarter PERIOD

Vanderbilt started their third drive at their own 36yard line after wide receiver Jayden McGowans kickoff return PERIOD A couple of dumpoff throws and a rollout run from Wright got the Commodores into Volunteer territory and a defensive false start on Tennessee helped propel them on a crucial thirdandfive PERIOD However the drive stalled and Vanderbilt kicker Joseph Bulovas hooked left a 39yard field goal attempt leaving the Commodores scoreless PERIOD

The teams quickly traded punts however Tennessees Dee Williams returned Vanderbilts attempt  yards to the house to put the Vols up three scores with  left in the second quarter  PERIOD

A threeandout by the Commodores gave Tennessee another opportunity to add to their lead but Vanderbilt stopped the Volunteers on a fourthandone attempt from the Vanderbilt 27yard line PERIOD Linebacker CJ Taylor snuck into the backfield tackling Small to cause the turnover on downs PERIOD

The stop gave some life to the Commodores who gained two first downs on designed runs for Wright PERIOD The sevenplay drive stalled on the Tennessee  though forcing the Commodores to punt just before half PERIOD Tennessee ran the clock out up  at the break PERIOD

McGowans 41yard kickoff return after the half gave Leas offense another prime offensive opportunity but the Commodores turned the ball over on downs PERIOD

Small broke a 52yard run up the middle two plays later for another Tennessee touchdown PERIOD He finished the day with  yards for  TDs on  carries PERIOD

On the next drive in a play that was emblematic of the loss Vanderbilt punter Matt Hayball ran a fake punt on 4thand6 picked up  yards but fumbled the ball at midfield giving the ball back to the Volunteers PERIOD

Two plays later Tennessee running back Jaylen Wright rushed  yards right through the Vanderbilt defense barely touched on his way to the endzone PERIOD

After falling behind  Lea made a quarterback adjustment putting freshman AJ Swann back under center PERIOD Swann missed two games due to an injury during the South Carolina loss PERIOD

The offense did not improve however and Vanderbilt had to punt after allowing a sack after picking up just one first down PERIOD

The Vols continued their hurryup offense and Milton III threw a 7yard dart to wide receiver Walker Merrill for his only passing TD of the night PERIOD Tennessee only possessed the ball for just over  minutes compared to Vanderbilts  minutes in control in the game PERIOD

Vanderbilt turned to the air despite the continued pouring rain and Swann completed fourofseven passing attempts to put the Commodores in Volunteer territory PERIOD However McGowan was stopped just short of the line to gain at the Tennessee  forcing a Vanderbilt fourth down passing attempt that was batted down to the ground PERIOD

Vanderbilt quickly got the ball back after forcing a Tennessee threeandout as the third quarter expired PERIOD Swann led the team up the field once again completing passes to Sheppard and McGowan entering the red zone PERIOD However the Tennessee defense made yet another stop on fourth down and the Commodores came up empty on the 7play 53yard drive PERIOD

Tennessee wasted no time adding to the scoreboard PERIOD Wright rushed left through the Vanderbilt secondary untouched and outran the defenders  yards to the endzone to extend the Volunteer lead to  PERIOD Wright ended with  yards and  TDs on only  attempts PERIOD

Vanderbilt punted the ball back to Tennessee quickly and again allowed a rushing touchdown on the Volunteers first play of the drive PERIOD Running back Dylan Sampson ran  yards to put Tennessee up  with  left in the fourth quarter PERIOD

Neither team made much more offensive progress for the rest of the game letting the clock run out leaving the score at  PERIOD

We played uncharacteristically in that second half Lea said PERIOD We played unstructured against the run and we played against a good opponent PERIOD Where we were a gap short or step slow they made us pay by outrunning us to the end zone. vanderbilt finishes the season  the Commodores best record since  PERIOD
