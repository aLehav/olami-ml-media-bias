6220,2023-10-08,"the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of  which passed in the House on Dec PERIOD  tightens loan regulations to ensure that students are only spending money on the necessities you know things like a 32percentmoreexpensive substantially less competitive education PERIOD Though the bill is a noble attempt at locking down the loan market to avoid future classes it creates a dangerously restrictive system for a demographic thats barely weaned itself off mom and dads bank account PERIOD

The bill would create the Consumer Financial Protection Agency  a watchdog organization to regulate home mortgages credit cards interest rates and student loans PERIOD The agency has the power to cap the amount of money students can borrow and  most importantly  where we can borrow it from PERIOD The bill would empower us by providing beneficial information about financial options and the ability to take out federal loans but then degrade us by placing a cap on private loans and taking the power to make these important financial decisions out of our hands

Theres more than enough bad news and ugly numbers to explain why this bill was proposed PERIOD Private loans  which can have interest rates up to  percent  were taken out by  percent of college students by  PERIOD On average  percent of public university graduates face an average debt of  by the time they set out on the job hunt PERIOD The outlook for paying it back doesnt look too hopeful either the U.S PERIOD Department of Education reported an increase in the student loan default rate from . percent to . percent from  to  PERIOD

Under this bill all institutions which offer private loans are regulated by the CFPA PERIOD Officials must verify the enrollment status of any potential student borrowers to determine whether a student is eligible to take out federal loans PERIOD If a potential borrower is still eligible for a federal loan private institutions are obligated to advise that choice instead PERIOD Though it might not be good for business fat cats like private loan company Sallie Mae are obligated to inform potential students borrowers of all other options available PERIOD

If the  percent of students who take out private loans while still eligible for federal money can avoid doing so all the better but the CFPA also has a stiffer agenda to make sure these lenders are only giving loans to students who will use the money strictly for educational purposes PERIOD

Its no secret that we use loan money for more than just textbooks and tuition PERIOD Even more tempting than borrowing money for college is using it to pad our cushy lifestyle just a little bit longer PERIOD And thats exactly what this bill tries to fight PERIOD

In a perfect world loan money would be used for education not a tricked MacBook Pro PERIOD Students would only take out private loans when they need to and not cripple their finances by borrowing more money than the cost of attendance PERIOD

But its important for politicians to remember that were more than machines whose whole existence is dedicated to mastering quantum mechanics over a 24pack of ramen PERIOD College is a game of responsibility and playing may require exceeding the basics student debt be damned PERIOD So maybe we want to fund a trip around world before we graduate PERIOD Or less thrilling newfound financial hardship may arise PERIOD

And maybe we need the money because a MacBook Pro is the only way to follow our dream of becoming a hotshot filmmaker PERIOD Whos to say that luxuries arent part of our education too If we come up short should we just give up

Placing a cap on our income because were college students is a step back from Californias leading example PERIOD It forgets to take into account the varying circumstances in which we might need money to invest in our career and it cripples our ability to manage our finances debt and future PERIOD

Student loans are among the most ironclad of financial agreements unable to be discharged even in the case of bankruptcy or death PERIOD We may not have the best track record while were in school but the fact that were in a fouryear university and the loans are impossible to discharge ensure that they will eventually be paid back PERIOD For every student who needs more money for a ritzy spring break trip theres another one who needs it for that essential laptop the parents wont shell out for PERIOD H.R PERIOD  tries to protect everyone but instead marginalizes those who truly need the help PERIOD

We may be an expensive bunch but expecting us to run the world without some financial autonomy will postpone our eventual success even further PERIOD Were young naive and we learn best through trial and error  God forbid we learn those lessons in the real world when a lot more is at stake PERIOD
