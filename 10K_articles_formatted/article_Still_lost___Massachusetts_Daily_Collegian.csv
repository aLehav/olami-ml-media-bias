I find it incredibly pathetic that I am now a senior at this university and still get lost PERIOD

I still wander around Hasbrouck and Morrill looking for phantom auditoriums where ohsoimportant classes with Intro in their titles wait to impart on me some modicum of information Ive already written a twenty page paper on for one of my other more numerically intimidating classes PERIOD

The good news is that Im not alone on my little detours through boiler rooms and seldom used closets PERIOD Im surrounded by dozens of fresh faced brighteyed freshmen PERIOD It truly gives one a Moses complex PERIOD Morrill N329 Let my people go

At the risk of sounding patronizing let me say how young all these freshmen are PERIOD I mean they may be  but they really dont look it PERIOD Either that or my eyes have aged faster than the rest of me because I seriously think that some of these kids are like Doogie Howser zipping through college PERIOD

I hope they understand that PERIOD

Friends Minutemen Upper class people Think of all they missed PERIOD Most were born in  which means they were three when the Challenger exploded PERIOD They were six when Hazelwood had a few martinis and decided to play slalom with the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound PERIOD None of them remember Ollie North testifying on every TV in the nation PERIOD None of them were alive when the President was shot PERIOD Granted I was only one when Ronnie took a round in the chest but just to expound on my point PERIOD Theyre young

But they have their own milestones PERIOD They remember where they were when OJ was found not guilty PERIOD They remember watching Columbine on TV and the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing PERIOD

To them Breakfast Club and Better Off Dead are Comedy Central Saturday afternoon movies instead of videos that your friends older brother rented and let you watch PERIOD Their horror movies are Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer not Friday the thirteenth Part  PERIOD Remember that strap scene in the woods when that guys head split What eight yearold wasnt fascinated

But there are similarities between these young have I mentioned theyre young collegians and upperclassmen like myself PERIOD For instance the campus remains predominantly ugly to both groups PERIOD The SGA still manages to screw both groups over with equal success PERIOD And for all of us the clock is ticking PERIOD

Nice segue huh

It really is only nine months before I leave this university one way or the other PERIOD In a perfect world Ill have my degree in a not so perfect world Ill be taking night classes and flipping burgers back on the South Shore PERIOD

For our freshmen friends the world of UMass is their oyster PERIOD Everything to them is new exciting and wonderful PERIOD And a bit scary at times PERIOD Theyve been told time and time again that these right here are the best years of their lives and pretty soon it will end PERIOD

How sad PERIOD

Listen whoever told you that college will be the best time of your life isnt living the right way PERIOD They arent trying to squeeze every moment of joy and happiness out the day PERIOD Personally I hope my best years are my last ones whenever those may be PERIOD I am having a great time here I love my college experience all of the ups and downs included PERIOD But I want to keep having a great time in life and we should all keep that in mind PERIOD

Everyone should think upon graduation wow that was the greatest time of my life but shouldnt think that thats where its going to stop PERIOD Oh well college is over time to get serious and never crack a smile as long as I live PERIOD High school guidance counselors and other sad depressing forms of life like college newspaper columnists spew that kind of crap PERIOD

Live it up kids PERIOD And then keep it up PERIOD Keep living the life you want and trying to make everyday your best one PERIOD

And trust me this is about as optimistic as I get PERIOD
