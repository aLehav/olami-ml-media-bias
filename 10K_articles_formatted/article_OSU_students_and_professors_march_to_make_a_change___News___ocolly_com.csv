They marched in silence PERIOD They stood tall PERIOD No words were spoken you could barely hear any breathing PERIOD

There were onlookers some who avoided the marchers and others who stopped to take pictures PERIOD They did not speak their signs spoke for them PERIOD It was a solemn yet empowering moment PERIOD It was an outcry to all of Oklahoma State University a call to end Islamophobia PERIOD

Islamophopia is nothing new but the recent deaths of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill North Carolina sparked an opportunity to openly discuss the fear of Muslim people at OSU PERIOD Friday morning students and professors came together in silence to honor the lives of Deah Barakat Yusor AbuSalha and Razan AbuSalha three Muslim students who were shot and killed near University of North Carolina PERIOD

The silent march began at Agriculture Hall PERIOD The group marched down South Monroe Street eventually marching past the ChiO clock and ending in front of Edmon Low Library PERIOD It was a mixed group some who identified as Muslim and some who didnt PERIOD

Vibrant hijabs covered the heads of the Muslim women representing their religious practice PERIOD They were proud PERIOD They held signs that read Your beliefs dont make you a better person your behavior does and Whoever kills a life unjustly is as if he killed all of mankind Ibn Kathir  PERIOD

The pain showed on their faces some through tears and others bold stares PERIOD They not only marched for Barakat and the AbuSalha sisters they marched for every Muslim person whose life was cut short because of hate PERIOD

A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder arson or vandalism with an added element of bias according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation PERIOD The motive behind the shooting in Chapel Hill is still under investigation according to CNN but questions are up in the air as to whether it was a parking dispute or a hate crime that resulted in the shooting PERIOD There is speculation the students were targeted because of their faith PERIOD

OSU assistant history professor Charles Hughes said Islamaphobia is the belief that those who are Muslim or identify with Islamic faith represent a dangerous or subhuman group of people

It is a broad series of stereotypes and discriminatory practices  he said PERIOD Theres an ongoing problem with Islamaphobia in the U.S.

Hughes who isnt Muslim heard about the silent march an hour before it began PERIOD Willing to take any opportunity to speak out against violent acts motivated by fear and hatred Hughes said the death of these students needed acknowledgement PERIOD

The sheer brutality and tragedy of this incident coming against three MuslimAmerican students I think is a cause for all of us to on a more broader sense demonstrate that we consider these individuals and what happened to them to be important he said PERIOD

Sophomore Becky Corbin who heard about the march during class said the deaths of Barakat and the AbuSalha sisters saddened her PERIOD She said she believes the shootings could have possible escalated because of Islamophobia PERIOD It was hard for her to put into words but Corbin said she had no choice but to support the march PERIOD

As a human being we should stand up for people who are killed wrongly and stand up against violence like that but also as a Christian I thought I should be here she said PERIOD Its important to me. the march ended with every supporter lined up along the library water fountain PERIOD Still no one uttered a word PERIOD They faced library lawn PERIOD The Alma Mater melody began to play students exited the buildings surrounding the library PERIOD They walked by staring PERIOD Doctoral student Omar Amer stepped out of the line breaking the silence PERIOD

We are here to ask OSU students to help end Islamophobia he said PERIOD

The students stopped PERIOD He got their attention PERIOD
