Evan Smotrycz isnt the most imposing post player in the Big Ten PERIOD

After the Michigan mens basketball team completed its season sweep of Michigan State on Saturday even assistant coach Bacari Alexander had to heckle the freshman forward via Twitter about the goofy photograph posted on ESPN.com PERIOD

In the headline shot of Smotrycz celebrating his jersey is untucked his back is slouched and his undershirt sleeves conceal any muscle that may be hiding underneath PERIOD

And then theres the hair PERIOD

Its gelled to one side and curled up at the end forming a seemingly Greaserinspired wave of flowing locks PERIOD Smotrycz looks more like Fonzie than an upandcoming DivisionI athlete PERIOD And it certainly doesnt help that the photographer caught him as he let out a celebratory yell  because instead of depicting an exuberant battle cry he looks more a patron at an Italian restaurant dissatisfied with his penne alla vodka PERIOD

Members of the Fab Five wouldve cringed PERIOD

But style points aside Smotrycz haunted the Spartans on both ends of the floor finishing with  points a block and three steals PERIOD And at times he utilized an arsenal of post moves and pivots in the paint that many didnt even know he was capable of PERIOD

Indeed his play underneath is a very recent development PERIOD

Evan did almost no post defense no post moves in September October Michigan coach John Beilein said after the game PERIOD So starting in January we really started working with both post defense and post offense PERIOD The last couple weeks hes sort of attached himself to that a little bit knowing that people have taken away his threegame  how else can he help us

Beilein started playing the 6foot9 Smotrycz  a natural forward  intermittently at center about halfway through season PERIOD He formed a platoon with fellow freshman big man Jon Horford whenever starting center Jordan Morgan found himself benched with foul trouble   still a frequent occurrence evidenced on Saturday when Morgan collected two quick fouls and played just six minutes in the first half PERIOD

But recently Smotryczs minutes at forward have been limited PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  against a visiting Northwestern junior cocaptain Stu Douglass supplanted Smotrycz in the starting five for the first time all season as Beilein looked to install a more guardheavy offense PERIOD And the move worked  the Wolverines racked up its highest point total in over a month in the victory over the Wildcats  PERIOD

In turn Smotrycz has come off the bench ever since his playing time seemingly dwindling with the teams recent successes PERIOD

But on Saturday Morgans foul trouble and Horfords bruised knee provided Smotrycz with the opportunity to show what he could pull off against Michigan State in the paint PERIOD

And he didnt disappoint PERIOD

Early in the first half freshman wing Tim Hardaway Jr PERIOD fed the ball to Smotrycz on the low block PERIOD He faked the shot maintained the pivot took one dribble around his man into the paint and laid it in  all while drawing a foul from junior forward Delvon Roe and sneaking the ball over the outstretched arms of junior forward Draymond Green PERIOD

Michigan States two most heralded post players were left scratching their heads as Smotrycz completed the 3point play from the freethrow line PERIOD

Im not trying to move all the way to the post but its definitely good to have dimensions to my game because they cant just switch on screens Smotrycz said PERIOD I can switch and take a little guy to the post PERIOD But yeah definitely this was the first time I was sparring a little bit in the post. smotryczs dimensions certainly make him a rising star in the Big Ten PERIOD As he continues to develop his game in the paint some defenders will forget that they cant just crowd the lane to stop him PERIOD After all Smotrycz was recruited primarily as a shooting forward and after going 1for2 from deep and 5for5 from the line on Saturday he showed why he fits so well into the shoothappy Beilein offense PERIOD

And dont forget one of Smotryczs best qualities on the court  how his goofy faade can lull opponents to sleep PERIOD
