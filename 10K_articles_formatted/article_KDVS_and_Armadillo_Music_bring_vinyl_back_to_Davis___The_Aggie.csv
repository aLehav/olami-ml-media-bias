Vendors from all over California gather for Davis Vinyl  Music Fair

The weekend of Oct PERIOD  is the only weekend of football season when the Raiders dont play according to Paul Wilbur Armadillo Music staff member and Raiders season ticket holder PERIOD Thats why Wilbur chose this particular weekend to hold the Davis Vinyl and Music Fair at the Davis Senior Center PERIOD

Wilbur has worked here for over  years and has been helping to run the fair since its renewal in  PERIOD

The first one we ever did was  tables the one were doing now is  tables Wilbur said PERIOD

Since then the fair has come a long way PERIOD Last year over a thousand people attended the fair PERIOD

This year Armadillo Music has secured a number of new vendors and they hope to encourage even more vinyl enthusiasts to come PERIOD

We now have Woodstocks Pizza inside the venue so you can buy food which is huge Wilbur said PERIOD Doing so allows them to keep people inside the venue all day a great advantage according to Wilbur PERIOD

The numberone complaint I hear from people is that they didnt set aside enough time PERIOD Like theyll come in and say oh Ive got a halfhour and theyll look around and say I cant do anything here with half an hour I need three hours Wilbur said PERIOD

With vendors coming from all over California to sell records ranging from the Beatles to heavy metal Led Zeppelin to jazz it makes sense why people can spend hours getting lost at the fair PERIOD

I think the reason why vinyl has come back in such a big way is that in the modern age where your whole life is literally run through your phone young people miss having a connection to music Wilbur said PERIOD

They dont have a connection to music like I had when I was their age PERIOD To them the idea of sitting down and listening to a record player is absolute heaven because they have to stop doing everything else and listen. dynn Javier a secondyear English major andthe KDVS general manager agrees that vinyl is a very emotionallycharged medium PERIOD KDVS will be present at the fair to kickstart their first annual fall fundraiser PERIOD

A live freeform radio station is almost an allegory for vinyl its not the most popular or state of the art thing but it definitely has a place in a lot of peoples hearts Javier said which is one of the reasons KDVS is keen to be involved with the Vinyl Fair PERIOD If we can solicit a good number of people who are very interested in us after the event thats all we ask from it. armadillo Music and KDVS work together on sorting and exchanging vinyl and Javier praises Wilburs help immensely PERIOD

Hes very much invested in us and were very much invested in him so any chance we get to collaborate and make something happen together is worthwhile Javier said. pERIOD And we dont have to worry about money its just friends helping friends. it is this attitude which has helped make the Davis Vinyl Fair such a success over time with everyone in the community having an interest in improving the Davis music scene as a whole PERIOD

When asked for any final words of advice Wilbur had a few PERIOD

If youre going bring a bag and bring lots of ones and fives  its okay to haggle PERIOD You can say I dont want to pay  can I pay  People are there to sell things so absolutely come and treat it like a vinyl fair fleamarket have fun and give yourself lots of time PERIOD If you dont give yourself lots of time youre going to be mad at yourself. the Davis Vinyl and Music Fair will be held Oct PERIOD  from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m at the Davis Senior Center PERIOD Admission is free except for early bird entry from  to  a.m which is  PERIOD For more information please visit the Armadillo Music Facebook page PERIOD
