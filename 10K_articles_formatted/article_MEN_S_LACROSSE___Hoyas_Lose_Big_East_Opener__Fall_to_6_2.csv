After opening the season with six consecutive wins the No PERIOD  Georgetown mens lacrosse team dropped its second straight contest at Marquette University with an overtime score of  in its Big East opener PERIOD

The rivalry between the Hoyas and Golden Eagles is quickly developing as the two have gone  in their last six contests PERIOD Five of these have been decided by one goal and two have gone to overtime PERIOD

Junior attack Daniel Bucaro spearheaded the Hoya offense with a gamehigh five goals PERIOD Senior midfielder and team captain Craig Berge junior midfielder Lucas Wittenberg and senior attack Matt Behrens also each scored one goal PERIOD Berge and freshman defenseman Joe LiCalzi each tallied an assist PERIOD

Besides Bucaros performance perhaps the biggest story was the virtual absence of sophomore attack Jake Carraway PERIOD Carraway came into the game tied with Bucaro for the team lead in points but was stifled by the Marquette defense PERIOD For the first time all season he was held without a point PERIOD

On the defensive side of the ball senior goalie Nick Marrocco made six saves to keep the Blue and Gray in the game down the stretch PERIOD

Though their effort fell short the Hoyas proved resilient after giving up the first four goals of the game PERIOD Bucaro eventually found the back of the net though and Georgetown found itself down  after the first quarter PERIOD Georgetown again had a slow start in the second quarter before ripping off four unanswered goals that knotted the game  heading into halftime PERIOD

In the second half defenses for both teams tightened PERIOD Bucaro gave Georgetown its first lead of the game early in the fourth but Marquette answered quickly to tie the contest at eight PERIOD The Hoyas headed to overtime where they lost the opening faceoff which proved to be crucial as Marquette called timeout drew up a play and scored the golden goal just  seconds in to win PERIOD

The loss will drop Georgetown in the national polls but it also drops its record to  on the road with its only other loss of the season coming last week against Drexel PERIOD However the Hoyas will return to the Hilltop on Saturday to face No PERIOD  Denver in another Big East matchup a pivotal game in the Hoyas season as they look to snap the losing streak against one of the nations top programs PERIOD
