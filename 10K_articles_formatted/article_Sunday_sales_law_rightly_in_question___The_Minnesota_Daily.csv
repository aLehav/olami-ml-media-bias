5120,2023-11-04,"it is time for this outdated law to go and growlers are a start PERIOD

Published  March  

Minnesota lawmakers have once again proposed reforms to the states liquor laws though there has been no mention of a complete repeal of the ban on Sunday sales the Star Tribune reported last week PERIOD The House Commerce Committee has heard ideas ranging from selling growlers  64ounce containers of beer  on Sundays to refillable beer containers in general PERIOD

Issues with the states liquor laws have circulated at the Capitol for years with proposed changes gaining support from a wideranging audience PERIOD Proponents point to the fact that since people can buy liquor from a bar or restaurant after  A.M PERIOD in Minnesota shouldnt they be able to buy from a store

Opponents to any sort of reform or repeal  consisting mainly of either unions or wholesalers  contend that such a change would conflict with existing labor contracts PERIOD There has also been a mixed reaction from small business owners some of whom feel that they should have the freedom to sell whenever they can PERIOD Others feel that competition introduced on Sundays would be unfair as they dont have the same labor force as larger companies PERIOD

We feel that the current law is outdated and its time to consider repealing the law banning Sunday sales altogether PERIOD However the legislation should be written with potential harms to small businesses in mind PERIOD Its only a matter of time until this issue gains enough momentum to pass and we urge businesses to prepare for it PERIOD
