With everything happening in the Middle East and gas prices once again on the rise we tend to forget the supporting cast that plays a role in our economy PERIOD While it looks as though this war will continue forever or at least through the rest of Bushs presidency the oil companies have refused to do anything to alleviate the financial pain we all feel and believe me they are not feeling any pains financial or other PERIOD While most of us simply grumble to ourselves at the gas pumps many people are too cold to grumble and are hovering under whatever blankets they own in their unheated homes PERIOD

For several years but this past winter in particular where the cold has been especially harsh many people have not been able to afford the oil necessary to heat their homes PERIOD Joe Kennedy and the Citizens Energy Corporation have been working with Latin American countries for almost  years to bring affordable heating oil to lowincome households PERIOD In February US Representative Chaka Fattah initiated Citgos delivery of  million gallons of oil at a  percent discount to families in need in Philadelphia PERIOD In this recent plea by congressmen for cheaper oil for their constituents Citgo Venezuelas oil company has been the only one willing to help PERIOD

The Bush administration has been critical of this discounted oil exchange primarily because Venezuelas president Hugo Chavez is very antiBush and has often spoken out against US foreign policy PERIOD Although many in Venezuela feel Chavez is too much of a leftwing radical most respect and admire him PERIOD Pushing towards a socialist democracy which is such a loaded term Ill save it for another day Chavez has started the Bolivarian Missions a domestic project which says it is dedicated to battling disease poverty and other social injustices PERIOD

Whether you agree with Chavezs politics or not the fact is hes responsible for helping thousands of freezing cold families in the Northeast and hes a savvy politician as well PERIOD His goodwill gesture selling oil at a bargain to poor families places him above criticism PERIOD This particular venture is a brilliant way for Chavez to gain exposure and support while continuing to throw it in Bushs face PERIOD Bush is not upset that Venezuela is selling us oil the US already buys millions of barrels from them each day although thats nothing in comparison to what we get from the Middle East every day PERIOD The reason Bush is upset is because Venezuela is selling the oil cheaply to lowincome households and this will create sympathy and respect for a staunch outspoken Bush critic PERIOD Chavez also often denounces US foreign policy which currently is focused on oil PERIOD Whether the government admits this or not its the truth PERIOD Wars are not waged if the country holds no US interests PERIOD Otherwise wed be in Darfur instead of Iraq PERIOD

Chavez might not be the sympathetic man he makes himself out to be PERIOD Perhaps this whole discounted oil sale is just a way to manipulate the US and Chavezs own image PERIOD Maybe he only has his own interests in mind PERIOD But the oil companies that refused to come forward to help people because they couldnt bear to sell oil at a discount even though theyve all experienced record profits in the years since the US invaded Iraq they are the people who only have their own interests in mind PERIOD

If you or anyone you know cant afford to heat their homes this winter or for more information about alternative sources for oil visit www.citizensenergy.com PERIOD
