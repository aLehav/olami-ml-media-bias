Whether it was swimming softball or golf Abby continually could not beat her sister PERIOD One day after losing to her sister in the junior golf championship at her local club when she was  years old she vowed she would never lose to her in golf again PERIOD

Before joining Penn State this past August Pearson worked as a marketing manager for Duramed Pharmaceuticals which was the lead sponsor of the Futures Tour as well as the sponsor for several collegiate tournaments around the country PERIOD It was during this time when Pearson felt the urge to coach again PERIOD

She had crossed paths with Penn State head coach Denise St PERIOD Pierre several times while working at tournaments for Duramed and thought highly of her PERIOD So when St PERIOD Pierre called and offered her the assistant coaching position the decision was a nobrainer for Pearson PERIOD

When coach St PERIOD Pierre called and asked I said absolutely  said Pearson a native of Florence S.C PERIOD Its a great opportunity for me to give this dream a shot at a Big Ten university and help move the team forward. the primary reason Pearson chose to come back and coach is because she loves helping young golfers reach their full potential and seeing them become the best they can be PERIOD

I want to help the girls achieve their dreams Pearson said PERIOD I want them to become better studentathletes and help them become more accountable and responsible. pearson had a standout collegiate career at the University of Tennessee from  to  PERIOD In fact she was one of only two golfers that helped launch the Division I womens golf program at the school PERIOD

Abby has been a fantastic addition to our program Vosters said PERIOD Shes taught me that no matter what you need to trust in yourself so you know youve given each shot your all. after two years at Tennessee Pearson left to join the Futures Tour in  where she had three tournament victories PERIOD Following in the winter she won one match on the Central Florida Challenge PERIOD In  Pearson had the opportunity to compete in the U.S PERIOD Womens Open an opportunity she will never forget PERIOD

Despite not making the LPGA Tour Pearson is using her career accomplishments as teaching tools to provide to the team PERIOD She says she hopes to instill the work ethic she had into the team now PERIOD

Ive learned what it takes to get to that level and all the hard work that you have to put into it Pearson said PERIOD

Its been great to have Abby on board St PERIOD Pierre said PERIOD She brings a level of energy to the team and she brings another element as a former competitor PERIOD Its been good for the players to hear her perspective on things. yet despite all she has accomplished in her career Pearson has still never defeated her sister in golf PERIOD While she doubts that they will ever play each other competitively again Pearson has an idea of who might come out victorious today PERIOD
