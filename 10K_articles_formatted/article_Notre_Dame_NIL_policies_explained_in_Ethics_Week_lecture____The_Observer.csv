Alysa Guffey  Wednesday February  

When name image and likeness NIL exploded in college athletics  months ago Notre Dame analyzed how it could support its studentathletes while not sacrificing its identity as a university PERIOD

When we talk to our studentathletes who are our primary audience we cannot dive right into name image and likeness senior associate athletic director Claire VeNard said PERIOD We have to start with the core of who we are and what this opportunity is which is to come to the University of Notre Dame to grow and develop as a student as an athlete and as a person. on the second day of this years NILfocused Ethics Week hosted by the Mendoza College of Business VeNard detailed the Universitys unique policies on the rapidly growing force in college football PERIOD

The first official NCAA NIL policy went into effect on July   PERIOD Indiana is one of seven states that have not touched NIL legislation meaning Notre Dame started from scratch when crafting an institutional policy for its studentathletes VeNard said PERIOD

Notre Dame also adds one more category to its policies  ideas PERIOD Through theIDEA Center the University has seen studentathletes pursue startupsthat can benefit financially and socially from the approval of NIL VeNard said PERIOD One example is Pediatric Peptalk a nonprofit created by Irish lacrosse player Max Manyak that connects children with chronic illnesses to their favorite athletes PERIOD

By the end of its initial policy formation stage Notre Dame landed on five elements that would differentiate its approach to NIL and simultaneously uphold the Universitys overarching mission brand building content management name image likeness and ideas NILI education market facilitation and thirdparty initiatives PERIOD

Under its regulations the NCAA limits how colleges can promote NIL deals for its athletes PERIOD

We are limited in how we can do this by the NCAAs policy which says that we as an institution cannot pay them directly and we cannot create or facilitate NIL opportunities for them she said PERIOD

A common misconception in the NIL space is that thirdparty collectives are run by universities to pay and manage deals with athletes themselves VeNard said PERIOD

Its important to understand that they are not us even though the collectives associate with the institutions in the sense that that is who they support she said PERIOD But there is both legal and practical and operational separateness between what they are doing and what the institution is doing PERIOD

As a result the Universitys main role is to educate on the resources available to students and how to navigate the NIL space as long as Notre Dame does not offer legal or tax advice to its athletes PERIOD

Thats a line that were not crossing VeNard said PERIOD

A role that Notre Dame can take on however is the responsibility to create a marketplace where brands connect to studentathletes and partner with local firms such as MOGL a marketplace run by two Notre Dame alums PERIOD

We also like that narrative VeNard said PERIOD Brandon Wimbush former quarterback at Notre Dame had a very successful career and has now gone on to have a professional career in something other than football PERIOD Thats part of the Notre Dame proposition to come to Notre Dame as well. former Irish players also own collectives such as FUND  Friends of the University of Notre Dame  founded by former quarterback Brady Quinn PERIOD

A key appeal of Notre Dame in the NIL market is the football programs national market  a result of the schools independent status and geographically diverse fan base VeNard said PERIOD Making studentathletes aware of this distinction in the Notre Dame brand is one of the first steps of the educational role of the institution PERIOD

The brand exposure they get simply by having Notre Dame across their chest is really valuable and thats a piece that we communicate and we help them understand VeNard said PERIOD

Studentathletes also have the opportunity to further learn about NIL in the classroom through a onecredit course taught by VeNard titled Navigating NIL at Notre Dame. the course falls under the sports media and culture minor PERIOD

Another benefit Notre Dame gives athletes is access to its corporate partners such as Under Armour PERIOD Since the activation of NIL athletes collaborated with the brand for social media and instore promotional photos at the University PERIOD

In the lecture VeNard ran through what studentathletes can do what they must get permission to do and what they cannot do under any circumstances PERIOD

Groundlevel rules allow athletes to undergo selfbrand promotion on personal accounts including in Notre Dameissued gear that is not an official uniform PERIOD Deals that must be first approved by the University include wearing a uniform in a brand advertisement and participating in group activites such as the Irish offensive line securing an endorsement with Mission BBQ in Mishawaka PERIOD

 MissionBBQ has sponsored all  offensive linemen at Notre Dame

Prohibited actions include any NIL activities during official competitions and practices and any deals with brands that do not adhere to the Universitys Catholic mission  including du Lac PERIOD Some NIL regulations are paradoxically ironic as VeNard said studentathletes cannot gamble but they could promote gambling. answering an audience question regarding how Notre Dames NIL rules compare with other football powerhouses  Georgia Alabama LSU to name a few  VeNard said that Notre Dame has relatively competitive policies PERIOD

Our policies are actually pretty competitive in the sense that we have fewer banned categories she said PERIOD We give more broadly licenses to use intellectual property. share This Story
