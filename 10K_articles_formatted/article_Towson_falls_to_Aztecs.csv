Towson is off to an inauspicious start to the season after dropping their record to  against San Diego State University PERIOD The Tigers   CAA continue to search for answers in finding out the preferred rotation and trying to put together a full 40minute performance PERIOD

Its not quite what we expected but were going to bounce back and make sure that we stack up against the rest of the teams we play senior forward Nukiya Mayo said PERIOD

The Aztecs won  behind a balanced offensive effort from five doubledigit scorers led by junior guard Tea Adams  points and sophomore guard Mallory Adamss  points PERIOD Senior forward Nukiya Mayo and redshirt senior Qierra Murray nine points six assists tied for a gamehigh  minutes while Mayo recorded her second straight doubledouble of the season with  points and  rebounds PERIOD Redshirt junior guard Kionna Jeter followed up with  points and eight rebounds PERIOD

Thats my goal for the season to be playing the way that I am Mayo said PERIOD Because I know that will be what it takes to win another championship. just like against Penn State the Tigers started off really well on defense holding the Aztecs to just  shooting from the field in the second quarter PERIOD The Tigers held a  advantage going into the half PERIOD However that lead wouldnt last with San Diego State seizing the momentum and shooting . in the third quarter PERIOD

Some of our backup players I thought would be able to get in to step in is kind of a difference for them and a different level head coach Dianne Richardson said PERIOD They didnt perform to what I thought and so we had to keep our starters in a little longer PERIOD

Were working on that and working on rotations and who does well with whom and who can replace whom on the floor in crucial situations. in the third quarter the Tigers strung together two straight scoring possessions that created a 12point lead off a Jeter 3pointer PERIOD That  lead steadily evaporated after the Aztecs responded with an  run cutting the deficit to a onepoint game with six minutes left in the quarter PERIOD

We just have to make sure that we hit them before they hit us after halftime Mayo said PERIOD Not relax not take a break. not to be outdone Murray fed Jeter for a midrange jumper and brought the deficit back to  allowing the Tigers to exhale for just a moment PERIOD Murray converted on a long two to keep the Aztecs at bay  but the Aztecs onslaught persisted PERIOD The Aztecs momentarily took the lead off a pair of freethrows from Adams moments later PERIOD The Tigers left the period clinging on to a onepoint lead after junior center LaKaitlin Wright scored on a layup PERIOD

At that point the Aztecs momentum was undeniable and San Diego State rode it in a backandforth final quarter PERIOD Despite the final differential being eight points the Tigers fought back and another layup by Wright did keep the deficit to  with a minute left on the clock PERIOD That was the last bucket the Tigers scored PERIOD

Its getting the rotations getting the chemistry Richardson said PERIOD Me as a head coach I gotta get those rotations together PERIOD Im working on those things its not something we couldve worked on before we got into live games. following Monday nights game against the University of San Diego Towson will host Mount St PERIOD Marys on Saturday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Tipoff from SECU Arena is set for  p.m PERIOD
