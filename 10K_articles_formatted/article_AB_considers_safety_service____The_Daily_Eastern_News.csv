The Apportionment Board held its second meeting on Thursday to consider allocating  from the Student Government reserve account to fund a student safety project PERIOD



Jason Sandidge chair of the University Development and Recycling committee appealed to the board for funding to set up a mock trial safety escort service on campus PERIOD

About two months ago we did a safety walk and found out that the main concerns were that people didnt like walking around alone at night Sandidge said PERIOD This is just for students who feel like they need a little extra assistance so theres someone there to have their back. in a unanimous decision the board voted  to supply the money which will be used to purchase four polyester vests for the purpose of public identification as well as prepaid cell phones and extra minutes to contact students in need of assistance PERIOD

Sandidge intends to set  of that money aside for discretionary emergency use only PERIOD

Michael Whildin a member of the UDR committee said there was a good chance the committee would not use all the money PERIOD

Its kind of just a cushion Whildin said PERIOD Were looking into seeing if theres a phone in the lounge so we can cut down on the cost of cell phones. the committee obtained the idea of hosting the mock service from other schools including Southern Illinois UniversityEdwardsville which have implemented similar programs on campus PERIOD

We havent heard of any negatives thus far Whildin said PERIOD

The mock trial will be held on Dec PERIOD  and  from  p.m PERIOD to  a.m PERIOD Volunteers who would like to participate will meet in the study lounge of the Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD University Union to respond to phone calls from students requesting an escort home PERIOD

Volunteers will then note where the students are located how many are present and where they would like to go PERIOD From there two will be sent out clad in safety vests to escort the party to their destination PERIOD

According to Sandidge the mock trials purpose is to determine whether an escort service is needed or in demand PERIOD Should the trial be successful with students utilizing the service the UDR committee will present the data gathered from that weekend to the administration and request a permanent service everyday PERIOD

This would necessitate establishing paid positions for a fulltime staff Sandidge said PERIOD

He and Whildin have considered distributing cards with their contact information to raise awareness about the event and to generate feedback PERIOD

Some questioned the purpose of a safety escort service in addition to a campus police force PERIOD

Sandidge reminded the board that the campus police are there to protect students in the event of an emergency PERIOD

Theyre not there to escort students in need from point A to point B Sandidge said PERIOD

Patrick Lindstrom of the AB agreed PERIOD

Where I can see our concern being is that this might not work Lindstrom said PERIOD Its kind of a  experiment but if its money spent on student safety that comes first. fellow board member Robert Williams was not concerned about the amount PERIOD

Its only  Williams said PERIOD We have  in the account. more information regarding the mock trial safety escort service will be made available pending allocation approval from the Student Senate PERIOD
