A month ago no one cared if I voted for a thirdparty candidate PERIOD No one questioned my motivations PERIOD No one told me to check my privilege PERIOD No one even really asked me why I would do such a thing PERIOD And certainly no one believed I would have any significant impact on the then inevitable coronation of President Hillary Clinton PERIOD My party and I were an amusing little inanity and we were rhetorically patted on the head and sent on our merry way PERIOD On Wednesday morning however I was the Antichrist PERIOD As soon as things were not happening in favor of the advantaged party independents were plopped into the basket of deplorables and made to feel responsible for electing the orange guy PERIOD We are not so just stop that right now PERIOD 
For months I have bemoaned the by not voting for X you are electing Y argument and this week it seems as if that indignant chicken has come home to roost PERIOD As the democratic establishment reels from a crippling defeat blame shifting has occurred at a rate almost unprecedented even for Washington PERIOD This of course means that everyones favorite November villain  those godless nonconforming independents  have gotten more than our fair share of denunciation PERIOD I should also note that had Trump lost we would be getting the exact same lecture from the right PERIOD Voting thirdparty is all fun and games right up until the unexpected happens and then all of the people who did not vote Clinton are cast in the same light as those who voted for Trump PERIOD There is only one problem my ballot still reads exactly the same PERIOD 
As I said in an oped from several weeks ago entitled Defending Independents Done with the Norm my vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for Gary Johnson just as a vote for the ghost of Barry Goldwater would be a vote for the ghost of Barry Goldwater PERIOD There is no subversive implication there is only you a ballot and your conscience. at the time it was written I like to think that this statement was taken more or less at face value PERIOD Now I have no doubt that it will be taken to mean that I intentionally contributed to what has been described as nothing less than the dissolution of the union PERIOD This is wrong PERIOD
To speculate on my intentions after the fact is nonsensical and to rework them into fitting a narrative of bigotry or ignorance is dishonest and offensive PERIOD After informing myself of all available options I voted the way I did because I woefully disdain both candidates and steadfastly believe in libertarian principles to be clear it also had nothing to do with Johnson himself I understand that he is not the sharpest crayon in the box. lastly virtually no thirdparty voter wanted this outcome either PERIOD If anyone is to blame for abnormal thirdparty turnout it is establishment Democrats PERIOD Perhaps if Clintons victory hadnt been treated as a given for the last two years more people would have felt a sense of urgency in voting for her PERIOD But rather than take responsibility for a bad campaign and it was a bad campaign Clinton lost  counties that voted for Obama twice and  that voted for him once Democratic leadership is choosing to point fingers at the . percent of voters who chose to vote for someone other than the two scandaladdled forerunners PERIOD Saying that I cannot justify voting for Clinton  on the grounds of both policy and personality  is not the same as condoning Trump PERIOD I hope to God that political analysts will once again be proven wrong and that his victory will not symbolize all it has been made out to be PERIOD I certainly did not mean for this to happen PERIOD
