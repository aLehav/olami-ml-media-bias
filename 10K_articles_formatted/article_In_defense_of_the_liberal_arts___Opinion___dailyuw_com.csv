When asked why he chose to study mechanical engineering a friend of mine who is a recent graduate said 

Unlike this fellow who unfortunately is still unemployed I do not believe that a liberal education is incompatible with a successful future PERIOD While a liberal arts track may not place a student directly into the work force the same is true for many other departments and more  fields of study PERIOD Still the skills gained through a liberal education have many applications outside of academia PERIOD

The  part of a liberal arts education is not about politics PERIOD Instead it is about a students capabilities as an individual PERIOD The focus of this type of education is found through broad exposure to a myriad of academic disciplines with an emphasis on critical thinking independent problem solving and openmindedness PERIOD While students may not learn a particular trade or skill directly applicable to the work force the ability to think critically question claims and argue convincingly are certainly important abilities that will carry over to future careers PERIOD

However I recognize that it can require much more dedication to succeed in the fields of study deemed  I dont deny that it is easier to maintain a higher GPA with a major in English when compared with mechanical engineering PERIOD But does this mean that people inclined to study languages the arts or social sciences are less capable weaker students Absolutely not PERIOD While it may be easier to fly by in classes where there are fewer weekly assignments fewer concrete facts with answers that are either correct or not the skills learned are equally important PERIOD After all the purpose of education is not to simply use the mind as a holding cell for information PERIOD A liberal arts education instills in students the humility and selfawareness to recognize that they dont know it all  that they can learn much from their peers and experiences PERIOD

My advice While registering for classes for next quarter take a class in literature law or rhetoric PERIOD Upperdivision classes are often discussionbased and in some departments there are few or no prerequisites for them PERIOD This should lead to an understanding that there is worth in approaching higher education as not only a means to fill resumes PERIOD Im not trying to force people to choose a certain educational path nor am I saying that a liberal arts education is the best fit for everyone PERIOD I am just saying that varied class material has many benefits PERIOD

Above all a liberal arts education helps students navigate an everchanging world PERIOD Religious political and cultural diversity and scientific and technological advancement all result in constantly changing perceptions of what is factual and righteous PERIOD In the words of T.S PERIOD Eliot  To transcend the realm of all things known one must be willing and capable to recognize that there is always more PERIOD
