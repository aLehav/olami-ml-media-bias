ARA  Summer is here  and for many long weekends and sweltering temps inspire wanderlust and a sudden urge to relax on a faraway beach with a frosty beverage PERIOD While traveling is a great way to renew and recharge the long flights time zone changes and disruption of typical diet and exercise schedules can be anything but relaxing and can even cause digestive discomfort PERIOD



It is tempting to throw routine out the window while traveling whether it is to sleep in and skip a morning workout to choose dehydrating beverages over water or to grab fast food or a highcalorie dinner out instead of what youd normally choose says leading gastroenterologist and MiraLAX spokesperson Dr PERIOD Cynthia Yoshida PERIOD Unfortunately doing this can cause unpleasant digestive problems from bikini bloat to occasional constipation. fortunately says Dr PERIOD Yoshida there are some easy tricks that travelers can use to help keep digestive distress from ruining a trip PERIOD

Drink up PERIOD Dehydration can quickly throw your system out of sorts so be sure to drink sufficient fluids when on the road PERIOD Take a reusable water bottle with you and fill it with a noncarbonated and nonalcoholic beverage such as water or unsweetened iced tea that is caffeine free PERIOD

Dine before you depart PERIOD From greasy airport pizza to mayoladen inflight sandwiches air travel can be the most difficult time to get a decent meal PERIOD Many airports are now adding natural food stores to the concourse PERIOD Try to find one and pick up a selection of healthy highfiber snacks before boarding to stave off temptation PERIOD Try wholegrain granola bars PERIOD

Get a move on PERIOD Even if you are pressed for time try to find a way to incorporate light to moderate exercise into your routine PERIOD If you are experiencing digestive discomfort jumpstart your metabolism before heading out to start your day with a short burst of exercise such as a walk around your hotel or jumping jacks before heading into the shower in the morning PERIOD

Carry on some OTC relief PERIOD If you still find yourself suffering from occasional constipation you can still salvage your trip with an overthecounter remedy PERIOD Dr PERIOD Yoshida urges consumers to educate themselves that not all laxatives are created equal Some laxatives may have harsh side effects like urgency or cramping that can even further disrupt a trip PERIOD She recommends MiraLAX laxative which works effectively but without harsh side effects PERIOD It naturally balances the water in your digestive system and is available in convenient singledose packets that are easy to toss into a carryon PERIOD
