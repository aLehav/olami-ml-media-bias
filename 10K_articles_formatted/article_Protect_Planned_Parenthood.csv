It seems like every day something happens that makes me want to write ten pages about why its wrong PERIOD For reference I write these articles about a week before you read them so theres still a weeks worth of bullshit that hasnt even happened yet PERIOD

Its terrifying how difficult it is to keep up with everything.Whats worse is that by the time I do write about something its already old news PERIOD

This is being done on purpose PERIOD If one executive order is signed we have time to question it analyze it and try to change it PERIOD If ten executive orders are signed some will either end up waiting weeks before theyre properly analyzed or they may fall through the cracks completely PERIOD

We cant forget that just days after millions of women worldwide marched for their rights Trump banned the U.S PERIOD from funding any other countrys womens health care organizations if they offered or even just discussed abortion PERIOD

Weve gotten to a point where simply saying womens health care is politically charged even though its a basic necessity with no political agenda PERIOD As Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood puts it the women who come to Planned Parenthood they are Democrats Republicans Independents theyre not coming to make a political statement theyre coming because they need highquality affordable health care and thats what we provide. while that statement is in regards to Planned Parenthood specifically it stands for any other womens healthcare organization that is or is being threatened to be defunded PERIOD

If a woman needs healthcare including abortion she isnt doing it to make a statement or prove a point PERIOD Shes doing it because its the best healthiest option for her PERIOD

I know this is a heated topic but we live in a reality where nothing will ever stop abortions from happening PERIOD They can be greatly lowered however by easier access to birth control and information about reproductive health which is exactly what the organizations being defunded provide PERIOD

Its also important to note that no federal funding goes towards abortion whatsoever PERIOD It hasnt since the 70s PERIOD

Its so backwards to defund these places if the goal here really is to lower the abortion rate PERIOD If you look at what these organizations provide abortion isnt the main service to begin with PERIOD More commonly they provide cancer screenings prenatal care sex education and pap smears PERIOD

Cutting their funding wont end abortion it will quite literally kill women PERIOD

Not only will it take away access to the care I listed above it will cause women who are seeking abortion to go about it in dangerous even deadly ways PERIOD If we really were fighting for life in these scenarios we would fight for such procedures to be done as cleanly and as safely as possible PERIOD We would increase funding so that more women could gain access to birth control PERIOD We would not cut funding PERIOD

I understand that some of you are and will always be against abortion PERIOD Theres nothing wrong with that PERIOD You have control over your body and you can choose to control it however you need to PERIOD Where the problem lies is when we tell other women they cant do something that can be lifesaving because we simply dont like it PERIOD

The problem grows when we limit health care in general because the organization in question offers information and access to abortion as a viable medical option PERIOD

Im not telling you that you have to like abortion PERIOD Id argue that nobody likes it PERIOD But I urge you to realize that if Planned Parenthood gets defunded if Roe v PERIOD Wade gets overturned it will not end abortion PERIOD It will further police womens bodies and it will take away the independence that comes with being in control of if nothing else your own body PERIOD

It will take away access to important screenings like mammograms and pap smears from thousands of women PERIOD It already has PERIOD It isnt just a few women that rely on these organizations its thousands who cannot receive healthcare anywhere else PERIOD

It will endanger women who need to have an abortion PERIOD

I know that prolife beliefs come from a place of kindness and empathy PERIOD But if things keep going in the direction that they are thousands of women will face serious health risks and even lose their lives PERIOD

Please PERIOD Stop politicizing womens bodies and let us have access to the care we need PERIOD
