Letter to the Editor  Wednesday November  

My name is Paul Go and I graduated from Notre Dame with an M.S PERIOD in physics in  PERIOD I retired more than three years ago after working at the University for  years PERIOD

The other day a friend of mine was mugged while walking in broad daylight on campus near Cedar Grove cemetery PERIOD This was posted on an email to all the students staff and faculty PERIOD

The email concluded with a paragraph suggesting that people should walk in groups which is very impractical as well as very patronizing PERIOD I expect much more from our police department PERIOD

My recommendations to the Notre Dame police are as follows

First stop giving tickets to people driving on Angela IN933US31 Douglas and Twyckenham PERIOD Leave that job totally to the South Bend police county police or state police PERIOD

Secondly stop using uniform policemen with guns to give parking tickets PERIOD I just witnessed this the other night while walking out of the library PERIOD Can you imagine the outrage of the citizens of South Bend or Chicago if that was part of the job description of their police officers Hire civilians or even parttime students as part of their work study for that job PERIOD

Then increase by much more the police presence on campus PERIOD Most criminals can be discouraged if police are present everywhere at all times PERIOD I think the official term for this is community policing PERIOD In regard to the police absence on campus I can personally testify to this PERIOD I go to Notre Dame almost daily on a different parts of the campus at different times of the day or night either going to daily Mass going to class in DeBartolo Hall going to the library or visiting friends at OIT PERIOD I have purposely waited to write this letter until now because I wanted to at least personally see that my allegation is true and unfortunately I have to say at least from my point of view the police presence at Notre Dame is almost nonexistent PERIOD

I agree that to expect to stop all criminal activities is an impossible task but much more must be done if we want to keep our students faculty staff and visitors safe PERIOD
