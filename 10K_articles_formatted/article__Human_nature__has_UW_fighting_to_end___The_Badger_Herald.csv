In the middle of a fourgame losing skid the Wisconsin mens hockey faithful still have plenty to look forward to as the final stretch of the season approaches PERIOD

The Badgers   WCHA have dropped four straight games to conference foes despite outshooting their opponents  in their last two games and now find themselves secondtolast in the WCHA standings PERIOD

With the WCHA playoffs approaching and home ice seemingly out of reach head coach Mike Eaves said his team isnt ready to back down just yet PERIOD

We have a choice now  we can roll over and play dead but thats not human nature Eaves said in his Monday press conference PERIOD Human nature is to fight and to scrap PERIOD All we can do right now is get ready for Friday night. the road doesnt get any easier for the Badgers PERIOD No PERIOD  Denver comes to the Kohl Center this weekend looking to extend its twogame winning streak which was started by an impressive series sweep of the thenNo PERIOD  Minnesota Golden Gophers PERIOD

Currently sitting in third place in the conference standings Denver will surely be a difficult test for Wisconsin PERIOD The Pioneers bring a highpowered offense to Madison with the best power play conversion rate in the WCHA at  percent and rank third in the WCHA in scoring offense with  goals on the year PERIOD

A lot of things youd say you would want in a toprated team they have those qualities Eaves said of Denver PERIOD They compete their fannies off. eaves hopes the week off will help reenergize the Badgers after their longest losing streak of the season PERIOD UW dropped two games on the road to North Dakota and was then swept on its home ice by St PERIOD Cloud State last weekend PERIOD

Heading into the bye Wisconsin suffered a painful  defeat in which the team fired off  shots but was unable to get past SCSUs to take advantage PERIOD

Usually when you have a week off they come in with a little more jump Eaves said PERIOD We hope they use that jump to help us this weekend. although the weekend series with Denver poses an array of challenges the Badgers will likely be aided by the return of junior forward Derek Lee who is probable for Fridays contest after only playing in seven games this season due to injury PERIOD

With a roster dominated by young inexperienced players most Wisconsin hockey fans expected the  campaign to be a rebuilding year for Eaves squad PERIOD As such the Badgers are in the bottom half of the WCHA in several categories including scoring offense and goals allowed PERIOD

Although the Badgers sit near the bottom of the WCHA with just six regular season games remaining signs are still pointing up for the future PERIOD The team will lose just one player next season to graduation that of Eric Springer the teams lone senior PERIOD

Springer a native of Wrightstown Wis. has four assists and a goal on the year but remains a leader in the locker room and will prove a tough loss off the ice for the Badgers PERIOD

I think when youre the only senior its difficult because there is a lot of responsibility there Eaves said PERIOD Hes playing his best hockey now because hes comfortable with his role and he understands what he needs to do to help this team PERIOD

This team is in the middle of growth PERIOD Are we going to quit growing or continue to get better day by day Just knowing these guys I think thats the path that we are going to follow. many of the young Badgers currently on the squad will experience UWs dying days in the WCHA after  years and the birth of the Big Ten hockey conference in the  PERIOD

The future institution recently voted to hold its conference tournament at neutral sites rather than have teams themselves host games a move with which Eaves felt OK PERIOD

Well I think if you look at the big picture its always good to have games in your own barn and to play in front of your own crowd he said PERIOD  There has been a real good success in neutral site with the WCHA Playoffs and such that I think that the Big Ten came back around and looked at it again with all the things they were finding about getting home sites and it looked like a real good alternative PERIOD

I think theres more upside to doing a neutral site. this article was published Feb   at  pm and last
