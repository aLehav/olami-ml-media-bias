EBills seem to be the wave of the future as students embark on uncharted territory by receiving bills through email PERIOD

The system was designed to create a more convenient way for students to pay their account charges PERIOD Students receive EBills every month and the tuition bill will be due Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

EBills received mixed feelings from students who have used them PERIOD

I was pretty hesitant to try it out at first said Juan Navarro junior in engineering PERIOD Im a little insecure about doing stuff online. navarros initial reaction was similar to many students when they received an email telling them December would be the last month they would receive a paper bill PERIOD



Most students have greeted the change positively and Navarros worries have subsided PERIOD

I trust it I think it works he said PERIOD

Some students greeted EBills with more enthusiasm than others though PERIOD

Lindsey Harms and Caitlyn Getty freshmen in ACES are still attached to the old method of paper billing PERIOD

It is nicer to get the mailing because then you have it Getty said PERIOD Its there and you dont have to worry about checking it online. harms like many students sends her bill to her parents and felt that EBills were not convenient in her situation PERIOD

My parents arent computersavvy so I have to print it off either way she said PERIOD

Other students like Nathan Thompson junior in LAS are welcoming EBills with open arms PERIOD

Thompson who also forwards his bill to his parents felt that the new system made it even easier to pass his charges along PERIOD

The email can go straight to my parents and they can just pay the bills with their credit cards and I dont have to worry about sending any mail to them he said PERIOD

Thompson was not worried about the level of skill required to view the bills and felt that his parents would not encounter any difficulty using the system PERIOD

The EBills seem pretty userfriendly I think people should be able to handle them even if theyre not familiar with email he said PERIOD

Joe Creek director of the University Student Financial Services and Cashier Operations feels there are many positive aspects of the new EBilling system PERIOD

We made it much more studentfriendly he said PERIOD

Creek and colleagues from the University of Illinois campuses in Springfield and Chicago decided on the EBilling method to create a more convenient payment system for students PERIOD

They can find it  so its a nice feature for the students he said PERIOD If they need to move it on to mom and dad they can do that as well. students may authorize their parents to view their bills or even add an additional email address to allow for parents or guardians to receive EBill notifications PERIOD

Assistant Director of the University Student Financial Services and Cashiers Janet Milbrandt said she had not encountered many students who had trouble with the system PERIOD

Freshmen had the most problems because they did not know where they could find the information PERIOD

Students who encounter problems can visit the office in  Henry Administration Building or call  PERIOD

We will certainly help them through it she said PERIOD

EBills offer many new benefits including convenient access to account information yearlong records of student bills and online payment methods that include electronic checks which are free and either American Express or Discover credit cards that add a  percent convenience fee PERIOD
