4138,2014-09-25,"beatrice Contreras left and Bailey Loverin both have resigned from their posts on the eve of fall quarter PERIOD Kenneth SongDaily Nexus

Former Associated Students Student Advocate General thirdyear literature major Bailey Loverin and former A.S PERIOD External Vice President of Local Affairs fourthyear sociology and Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras both resigned from their positions on the A.S PERIOD executive board earlier this month PERIOD

Loverin and Contreras were elected to their respective positions in a campuswide election last Spring PERIOD Contreras ran with the Open Peoples Party while Loverin ran as an independent per S.A.G PERIOD office tradition PERIOD After Contrerass election however OPP rescinded her party membership midMay following controversy regarding Contrerass alleged sexual assault of another student PERIOD

While Contreras offered no comment Loverin cited personal medical issues as the cause of her departure PERIOD Both will be replaced in a special election held this fall PERIOD

According to secondyear political science major and A.S PERIOD Elections Committee chair Fiona Hayman the forthcoming election is challenging because it has no precedent PERIOD

I think the last special election at UCSB was in  and it was under completely different circumstances so were working to make it pretty similar to the general election with regards to the timelineHayman said PERIOD

Hayman said much of the election process would be improvised PERIOD

Were going to have to play a lot of it by ear Hayman said PERIOD We dont really know whos going to run yet and how many candidates there are going to be so a lot of it is still up in the air. according to A.S PERIOD President and fourthyear sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy the special election will most likely be held during the fifth week of fall quarter PERIOD

Hayman said the special election will be similar to the general election held in April in that it will not only feature replacement candidates for Contreras and Loverin but that it could potentially include new fee initiatives and referendums should any be proposed PERIOD According to Guthy no initiatives have been proposed yet and more specific information regarding deadlines for filing candidacy and referendum proposals will be released Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

This is also an opportunity for any A.S PERIOD entities or campus departments to propose any new fee initiatives or referendums for the ballot Hayman said PERIOD Its not just going to be electing new executives for those two positions so theres also other stuff thats going to be on the ballot. according to current A.S PERIOD External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourthyear political science and film  media studies double major Melvin Singh both Contreras and Loverin are experiencing difficulties in their personal lives which they feel prevent them from adequately performing their former executive duties PERIOD

All of the executives do this job knowing what they are getting into so it does take a whole lot to resign Singh said in an email PERIOD They both had things happen in their personal lives after taking office that prevented them from feeling that they could give their positions the attention and effort they felt it deserved PERIOD Its not an easy circumstance for anyone else to imagine being in but they experienced it. in her resignation statement Loverin said she could not dedicate the time and energy required for the position PERIOD

Due to personal and unforeseen medical issues I have neither the energy nor the time to the extent of what is deserved by the student body and by the Association to dedicate to the Office of the Student Advocate Loverin said in an email PERIOD Guthy said Contreras and Loverins resignations would not affect any of their respective offices work PERIOD

I want to emphasize that the absence of these executive officers during the first few weeks of fall quarter will not limit the work conducted by the entire executive team Guthy said in an email PERIOD We are all very excited for the upcoming year and we have a plan in effect to ensure that the EVPLA and OSA offices remain active and functioning until the executive officers are replaced. correction The article originally incorrectly implied the electionwill feature fee initiatives but Haymans actually said the election will be an opportunity for other ballot measures to be proposed not that such measures already have been proposed PERIOD The article has been changed accordingly. this story appeared on page  of Thursday September  2014s print edition of the Daily Nexus PERIOD

Beatrice Contreras was railroaded out of office by a mob she helped kindle during her time at Take Back The Night. part of me feels this is karmic justice PERIOD She knew full well that unsubstantiated rape allegations can ruin peoples lives but she didnt care enough to cease with the believe all survivors no one EVER lies about rape rhetoric until it came and bit HER in the ass PERIOD I hope the unraveling of this issue provides a stern lesson for some of the social justice assholes in student government PERIOD Nor am I saying for certain that the allegation isRead more 

This was a good article PERIOD Much better than that garbage that TBL wrote PERIOD I mean if Beatrice didnt give a reason for her resignation why would they try to tie that into some campaign at some student association And why would they interview people who havent been working with her Its irrelevant and theyre just turning into a tabloid trying to make something out of nothing PERIOD I can tell the Nexus is going to have a much better year than TBL PERIOD Im not sure why I even bother reading their stuff PERIOD Never again PERIOD Jason anyone who knows Beatrice would knowRead more 

The group Take Back The Night for which Beatrice was a liaison for a time REPEATEDLY makes such statements PERIOD Did Beatrice make any attempt whatsoever to change the dialogue No PERIOD Only a few people ever openly questioned that line of thinking because they knew theyd be called misogynists PERIOD I advocated for due process and the presumption of innocence in rape cases and I was shunned for it for a year PERIOD I was accused of hating women and called all sorts of names just for saying that we should NOT believe every single sexual assault allegation without question PERIOD Beatrice could haveRead more 

Nor am I a blind fan of Bailey PERIOD She introduced that ridiculous trigger warning measure after all PERIOD But I do know that during her brief time as SAG she told me she was shocked by how easy it is to railroad a student with an allegation of rape even without evidence PERIOD
