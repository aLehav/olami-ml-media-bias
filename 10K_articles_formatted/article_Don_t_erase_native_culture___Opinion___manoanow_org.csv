According to Noenoe Silva a political science professor at the university the prioritization on written over oral language was another method of cultural erasure againstnative Hawaiians PERIOD



On Oct PERIOD  I wrote an article entitled Unexploded ordnance impending problem and referenced the special relationship Native Hawaiians share with the land PERIOD

Unfortunately due to word count constraints and because I included the reference to Native Hawaiians as an afterthought rather than as the bulk of the sentence it was determined to be inconsequential to my argument and removed PERIOD

While it is true that the unexploded ordnance littering the islands is a problem for all residents these potentially dangerous weapons are more offensive to Native Hawaiians who have ties to the land that nonnative residents cannot claim PERIOD Forgetting or ignoring the way these weapons damage Native Hawaiian ties to the land is an act of erasure PERIOD

UNINTENTIONALERASURE

The benign edit made to my article can be interpreted as an unintentional act of Native Hawaiian erasure PERIOD Cultural erasure is a tool typically employed by colonial powers to suppress or erase the culture of another group PERIOD

Ethnic studies professor Davianna Pmaikai McGregor noted the erasure located in Hawaiian place names with shortened or renamed titles For example the area named Lanikai is really Kahao Enchanted Lake is Kaelepulu Diamond Head is Laeahi  Calling Kamehameha Highway Kam Highway. mcGregor also cites the failure of the state to recognize that geothermal energy is the life force of the sacred deity Pele and that its development would assault and deplete her being as contributing to the erasure of Hawaiis indigenous people and culture PERIOD

ANATIVEPERSPECTIVE

We who are not indigenous to these islands may be able to understand the plight of Native Hawaiians who attempt to preserve and honor their sacred sites and prevent the further desecration of the islands but we do not share their ancestral record nor do we practice the religious ceremonies performed here PERIOD

We have not been tasked with aloha and mlama ina a responsibility to love and care for the land PERIOD

We do not share in the same horror when mountains are destroyed in the name of building highways or when large American corporations expose iwi from burial sites to the sun and then store the remains in a closet under a parking garage PERIOD

We do not view the bombing of Kahoolawe as akin to bombing a living deity as do practitioners of Native Hawaiian religion who recognize that island as the kinolau or avatar of the god Kanaloa PERIOD

Nonnatives do not share in this spiritual and ancestral relationship with the land but those who align themselves with Native Hawaiian causes should actively campaign for a recognition of their ties to these islands and join in efforts to identify and rectify acts of erasure whenever we encounter them even if those actions are unintentional or created by our own hands PERIOD
