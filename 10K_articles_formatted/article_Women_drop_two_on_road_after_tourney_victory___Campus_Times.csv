The ice cold shooting handed the Jackets their first loss of the season and their record fell to  PERIOD The team looked to bounce back as they traveled on to Chicago for yet another tough road test against the undefeated Maroons PERIOD

The Jackets got another reminder that playing on the road is much tougher than playing at home as they took their second loss in a row at the hands of Chicago PERIOD After trading buckets for the first few minutes of the game the Maroons jumped out to a  lead at the ten minute mark of the first half and never trailed the rest of the way PERIOD Chicago would go into halftime with a  point lead  PERIOD

The Yellowjackets inability to put the ball in the hoop hurt them again as they could only come up with  points in the first half as a result of making only  of  shots from the field  percent PERIOD
