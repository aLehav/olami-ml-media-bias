Gabbi Parker came off the bench late in the fifth set to help the Huskies to a fiveset victory over California PERIOD She got a block assist that tied the score at  and then got a kill to give the Huskies the lead PERIOD

It was possibly the most critical moment in the Washington volleyball teams season PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Huskies   Pac12 were coming off a rare loss and in another tough road battle with No PERIOD  California   PERIOD After the two teams split the first four sets the UW was in danger of damaging its conference championship hopes and the lofty ranking it built during its 13match winning streak PERIOD

But the Huskies survived three match points in the fifth set to beat the Bears       Friday night in the most exciting contest of the season thanks to clutch play from senior Gabbi Parker PERIOD

We really had to earn the match with emotion and determination UW head coach Jim McLaughlin said PERIOD It was just grit and all the intangibles and we hope that sets the tone for the rest of the season. with two sub. teams making visits to Seattle next week to close out the regular season the UW is firmly in control of its own conference championship destiny PERIOD

The two teams traded blows in the decisive set as five kills from Cals junior outside hitter Christina Higgins offset four UW blocks PERIOD The Huskies looked dead down  but Parker came off the bench and to the rescue PERIOD

Parker was part of a block assist that tied the score at  and then had a kill to give UW a lead PERIOD Cal fought back but one of Krista Vansants matchhigh  kills ended the fifth set in a  UW victory PERIOD

Vansant led the way again but the UW did a better job of spreading the ball around than in the loss against No PERIOD  Stanford on Wednesday night PERIOD Kylin Muoz chipped in eight kills while Lianna Sybeldon and Melanie Wade combined for  PERIOD

Cals star outside hitter Adrienne Gehan was out with an injury but still found plenty of offense PERIOD Higgins had a teamhigh  kills while Lara Vukasovic hit . and finished with  kills PERIOD

Still the Huskies found just enough defense to win PERIOD Wade had eight block assists and a solo one as part of the UWs 16block team effort but it was Cassie Strickland who had possibly the most impressive defensive performance of the match PERIOD The sophomore outside hitter had a careerhigh  digs continuing an upward trend of defensive play PERIOD

Cassie did her job with great serving and passing McLaughlin said PERIOD Shes definitely headed in the right direction. errors near the end of sets cost the Huskies against the Cardinal but that was not the case Friday night PERIOD California had big leads in the second fourth and fifth sets but the Huskies battled back each time PERIOD

The Bears thwarted the comeback attempts in the second and fourth sets but the Huskies held on when it mattered PERIOD

You have got to be mature through the ebbs and flows of every match McLaughlin said PERIOD We understand that you have to play every point and that matches come down to two three four plays PERIOD

The Huskies got those plays Friday including the two from Parker that McLaughlin praised PERIOD

With a losing streak averted the Huskies return home for two matches to close out the regular season PERIOD They take on winless Oregon State on Wednesday at  p.m PERIOD
