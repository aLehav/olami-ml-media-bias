Less than  hours after a flock of Eagles stripped one New England team of their shot at a championship the Northeastern University Huskies were looking to avoid the same fate PERIOD The sixty-sixth Beanpot tournament got underway at TD Garden Monday Northeastern faced the Boston College Eagles and a 30year Beanpot drought PERIOD

That droughts days may be numbered and it could end in as little as one week Northeasterns top line of captain Nolan Stevens and Hobey Baker hopefuls Dylan Sikura and Adam Gaudette scored a goal apiece in a  victory sending the Huskies to the Beanpot final next Monday PERIOD

They had good chemistry together NU head coach Jim Madigan said PERIOD And theyre hard on pucks theyre skilled theyre smart PERIOD So we are going to ride them. madigan recognized his top line who he said played immensely. bC head coach Jerry York said the SikuraGaudetteStevens line is the best in Hockey East and maybe the best in the country. they were our leaders tonight theyve been our leaders all year long Madigan said PERIOD This was a big game for our upperclassmen who wanted to get back to that championship game PERIOD My hats off to them. northeasterns second power play of the game came when Biagio Lerario was tripped on a semibreakaway midway through the first period PERIOD The Huskies worked it around the zone until Sikura found the puck on the right side just beneath the faceoff circle and nipped a shot bouncing past secondyear goaltender Joseph Woll and a screen by Stevens for the first goal of the game PERIOD

We know were the best line on the ice Gaudette said of his prolific unit PERIOD

An electric Northeastern crowd elated by their teams early lead sent vibrations through the Gardens upper deck with their schoolspirited chants of experiential learning and a rendition of Stacys Mom. after an even first period Northeastern held a slight advantage on the scoreboard and the shot column outshooting the Eagles  the two BC penalties made the difference in the first PERIOD

Northeasterns penalty kill was tested less than two minutes into the second with firstyear forward Zach Solow in the box for a hooking minor PERIOD The Eagles pressured the offensive zone completing several crossice passes and firing three consecutive wristers at firstyear goaltender Cayden Primeau in less than a minute but to no avail as Primeau deflected each one PERIOD

Back at even strength an offensive rush led by Gaudette Sikura and Stevens gave the Huskies a scoring opportunity but they couldnt get a shot on goal and were perhaps guilty of overpassing PERIOD

The trio made up for it just three minutes later when Gaudette passed to Sikura who wristed the puck off Wolls pad producing a wideopen rebound chance for Stevens right in front PERIOD The fourthyear knocked it in for his eighteenth goal of the year and a  lead PERIOD

Primeau stood tall against spurts of BC pressure the Eagles controlled play for small parts of the first and the opening eight minutes of the second but the rookie was up to the task PERIOD He was the Huskies best penalty killer too The Eagles pair of unsuccessful power plays were not without some gradeA chances PERIOD

As the third period began BC was outshooting the Huskies  but trailed by two goals PERIOD The Eagles looked out of sync in comparison to their crosscity foes whose special teams may have made the difference PERIOD In a tight  game a  penalty kill and a  power play were key PERIOD The penalty kill threatened to score goals of its own on a couple occasions to no avail PERIOD

We limited the number of powerplay chances they had York said PERIOD Thats their breadandbutter theyre outstanding on the powerplay PERIOD So our objective was to stay out of the penalty box. bC pressed in the third putting  shots on the net in the frame but ultimately couldnt break through Primeau who was a rock for his team all night PERIOD One save in particular as he followed a pass across the rink on a BC powerplay and denied the ensuing onetimer underscored the nights theme of Primeau holding his team steady PERIOD

BC attacked us all night Madigan said Cayden Primeau I thought was immense all game long. sikura said this is nothing surprising from Primeau and the goalie has been like that all year. primeau though new to Northeastern was excited for the stage of the Beanpot PERIOD

All year people definitely have been talking about it Primeau said PERIOD Are you going to win this year What are the odds this year Its big in Boston. york complimented Primeaus play but said he wouldve liked his team to get more secondchance opportunities to further pressure the goalie PERIOD

We needed to get more traffic York said PERIOD

With  left in the game Gaudette completed the Big Threes offensive effort scoring the Huskies third goal of the game on another rebound chance for his sixth Beanpot goal in three years the most among active NU players PERIOD

Gaudette spoke to the chemistry his line has enjoyed all year culminating in an eyecatching stat line in the Beanpot semifinal PERIOD

Sikky and I have been playing with each other for three years Gaudette said PERIOD Were real comfortable with each other PERIOD We were just talking in the locker room about how when one of us gets a turnover the other just swings because we know theyre going to make a play. madigan praised his top offensive line but noted his admiration for the rest of his lineup Monday PERIOD

We have the horses and those three played really well Madigan said PERIOD I thought the other three lines though gave us a lot of quality shifts PERIOD They might not have scored but we built momentum through their shifts that allowed the big three to have some success. gaudettes goal all but sealed the result and Northeasterns Doghouse student section went into a state of euphoria counting down each remaining minute until the score went final PERIOD

With the win the Huskies earned a chance at their first Beanpot title since their last victory in  PERIOD Believers in fate will be sure to note the last time Boston College was shut out in the Beanpot in  at the hands of these Northeastern University Huskies PERIOD
