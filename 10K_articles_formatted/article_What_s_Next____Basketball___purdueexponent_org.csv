Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





Sophomore center Zach Edey dribbles the ball across the 3point line during practice while freshman Trey KaufmanRenn guards him PERIOD

Head coach Matt Painter will lose three seniors at the end of this school year PERIOD Forward Trevion Williams as well as guards Eric Hunter Jr PERIOD and Sasha Stefanovic dont plan on returning even with an extra year of eligibility from the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

These three were crucial to the teams success making up  of the Boilermakers minutes played PERIOD

Sophomore guard Jaden Ivey who led the team in scoring minutes and assists this season may also be leaving PERIOD The sophomore is a projected lottery pick according to nbadraft.net and has until April  to declare for the NBA draft PERIOD

Thats three of Purdues goto players that will be absent come fall as well as a possible fourth in Ivey PERIOD Painter has not seen a loss of talent this massive since  when his team lost Vincent Edwards Isaac Haas Dakota Mathias and PJ Thompson PERIOD

Returning will be Mason Gillis Caleb Furst Brandon Newman Isaiah Thompson Ethan Morton and Zach Edey barring any of them to transfer or declare for the draft PERIOD Alongside that group freshmen forwards Brian Waddell and Trey KaufmanRenn have redshirted this year to join Purdue PERIOD

Committed recruits Fletcher Loyer Camden Heide Braden Smith and 7foot2inch Swedish center William Berg will join the team as well PERIOD Those players fill out the roster at  but based on Painters tendency to give most freshman a redshirt like he did with Stefanovic and KaufmanRenn its likely hell do the same to Smith andor Heide PERIOD

This means Purdue may choose to take on one or two transfers PERIOD Last year Painter was one of only two coaches in the NCAA to not take in a transfer but the coach has not ruled out taking a transfer for this coming year PERIOD

Were the only team in the Sweet  that didnt take a transfer Painter said after the Saint Peters game PERIOD Doesnt mean that we wont but weve been able to recruit weve been able to evaluate weve been able to develop and weve been able to have good teams. several players have put their names into the transfer portal including three from rival Indiana Rob Phinisee Michael Durr and Khristian Lander PERIOD Painter may look their way as the trip up to West Lafayette is only a few hours PERIOD

While this coming years team probably doesnt have an NBA lottery pick or a dominating center duo it looks to come back to what fans have seen from Paintercoached teams in the past PERIOD There may be no more Ivey and Williams to control the offense which may mean fewer turnovers considering they committed more turnovers than any other Boilers this season PERIOD And with players like Morton and KaufmanRenn starting in place of Stefanovic the team may have better perimeterdefense and maintain its intense mantoman defense identity PERIOD

Now you lose some personnel but Im excited Painter said PERIOD I feel bad for these guys here but I like the guys that return on our team PERIOD I like the guys sitting out PERIOD Weve got guys that are sitting out that can play and weve got guys that are coming. log In
