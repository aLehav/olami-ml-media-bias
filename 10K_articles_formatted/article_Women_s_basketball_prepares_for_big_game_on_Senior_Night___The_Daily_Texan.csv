5989,2023-07-11,"the Longhorns a game away from their second consecutive 20win season will hit the court one last time at the Frank Erwin Center to hostTCU on Tuesday PERIOD

The team which currently sits at sixth place in the Big  is in jeopardy of losing the opportunity for a firstround bye in theconference tournament PERIOD

But theres even more on the line in this game PERIOD ItsSenior Night PERIOD

But this goaround feels different without senior forwardNneka Enemkpali PERIOD

She affected our whole team because of her leadership qualities head coach Karen Aston said PERIOD She was really the mother of the team PERIOD That was difficult to lose at the point that we lost it PERIOD It was difficult to replace because there really wasnt another personality as strong as Nneka with the maturity that she had. enemkpali said her torn ACL injury has provided a lesson in overcoming adversity and given her perspective about her time on the court PERIOD

Im sad that Im not physically able to play out there Enemkpali said PERIOD But I think looking back on the memories that I had at the Erwin Center the interactions with the fans and support of my family and teammates  its going to be easier for me to take in that journeyhere is over. senior guard Krystle Henderson will also play for the last time at Texas PERIOD Although she played two seasons at Wichita State she said she will miss the time she spent with her teammates PERIOD

I know I didnt come here for four years but its definitely been a learning experience for me Henderson said PERIOD Im going to try not to cry but Im sure Ill shed some tears. the team will try to bounce back after giving up a 14point lead in overtime against West Virginiaon Sunday PERIOD

Our team has had problems with what I call sticking the knife in and really stepping on someone when you have somewhat some control of the game Aston said PERIOD The most disappointing thing was how little we defended in thesecond half. texas will look to stop a potent TCU offense that ranks third in the conference in scoring averaging  points per game PERIOD TCUs defense produces nearly  stealsper game PERIOD

For all of the young players coming off of a tough road trip with a short turnaround you would be looking for some sort of something to probably dig a little deeper with and I would think that would be a great reason to do thatAston said PERIOD

The Longhorns lost their pervious matchup against the Horned Frogs last month by  points PERIOD They look to split the season series at  p.m PERIOD on theLonghorn Network PERIOD
