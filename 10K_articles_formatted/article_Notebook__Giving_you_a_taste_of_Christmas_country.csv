Exploring your inner Christmas country can be difficult especially when the same Martina McBride record has been orbiting your head for one too many years PERIOD Searching for anything to please your extended Nashvillian family members Looking to educate yourself on a standout classic that didnt click with your generation Every expedition needs its kickstarters and yours should be no exception PERIOD

Lady Antebellum  On This Winters Night

Stir some light percussion delicate piano and the warmth of a string orchestra to complete preparation for a Christmasready recipe PERIOD To any country listener who frequents Need You Now its evident that these are already the iconic ingredients to Lady As sound PERIOD Impassioned balladwork is the groups claim to fame and the holiday transition is barely a transition at all PERIOD

Rather than lullabying yourself to relaxation with Hello World take the chance this winter to heat the cocoa and sedate yourself with Lady As unexpected ballad rendition of Mariah Careys All I Want For Christmas Is You. the track is Hilary Scottexclusive vocally speaking but Charles Kelleys backup vocals initiate the Grammywinning harmonies that charm fans through any season PERIOD

The  record also features an original number  the records title track On This Winters Night. capitalizing on the melancholy piano themes of Own The Night particularly When You Were Mine the song narrates the peaceful satisfaction of this winters night. its often said that music is one of the few media that can simultaneously draw opposing emotions and this Lady A original provokes any number of holiday feelings PERIOD

Originals and Mariah Carey covers aside the record isnt astoundingly thoughtprovoking relative to other albums on the Holiday charts but certainly wellexecuted PERIOD Charles Hillary and Dave carry a musical elegance that flatters a Christmas studio album finer than other neighboring country artists PERIOD

Brad Paisley  Brad Paisley Christmas

Holidays are no reason for Brad Paisley to budge in his musical ground PERIOD On a scale from Mariah Careys Merry Christmas to Kenny Chesneys All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan Paisley leans closer to Chesney PERIOD If not for lyrical familiarity Winter Wonderland and Silver Bells could easily go unrecognized PERIOD Warning This record is for the southern humorist not the northern suburbanite in search of magical Christmas intimacy PERIOD

For those scouting out a classic holiday harhar veer on over to Paisleys rendition of Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy. not a Paisley original but the cover choice breeds character  not that this country goofball is in need of any PERIOD The selfwritten laugh comes from a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday. prep for talksinging and explore the mindboggle of Paisley and the Kung Pao Buckaroos attempt to write and sing a holiday song that wont offend the  sensitive holidayneutral folks PERIOD Eventually the track just censors each use of Christmas vocabulary PERIOD

If these songs are barking up the wrong Christmas tree gush over Born on Christmas Day. the first half of the track is an old recording of 13yearold Paisley debuting the ballad at a public gathering PERIOD The track eventually mixes into a mastered version of the modernday country superstar performing the Christmas narrative PERIOD Thirteen years old and publicly performing a holiday original  quite a songwriting feat PERIOD

John Denver  Rocky Mountain Christmas

One word classic PERIOD John Denver practically started churning out Christmas music the day he was born PERIOD In fact much of this iconic record is a compilation of Christmas tracks from his previous studio albums PERIOD

Aspenglow gives the gorgeous visual cue of countrywesterns favorite time of year accompanied by pleasantly melancholy melodies a paradox similar to the previously discussed Lady A track On This Winters Night PERIOD Add Denvers Christmas for Cowboys to the mix if youre looking for an original western tune with a dab of holiday thrown in PERIOD

As for its obligatory covers no matter how rocky mountain high Denver sings the performance is dependably effortless PERIOD Lowstress melodies for the fireside suit a December like stockings over the fireplace PERIOD Lady Antebellum and Brad Paisley are your offtheradar recommendations but if you havent yet added John Denvers Christmas repertoire to your season its time to make this bestseller part of your musical schema PERIOD
