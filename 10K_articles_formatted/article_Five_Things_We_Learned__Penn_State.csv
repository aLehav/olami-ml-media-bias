There wasnt much to learn from the Michigan football teams  rout of the injurydecimated Nittany Lions but the game clarified a few question marks that had emerged throughout the nonconference schedule PERIOD No PERIOD  Wisconsin comes to Ann Arbor next week and the Wolverines will want to make sure that most of those questions have answers PERIOD

Here are five things we learned from Michigans first Big Ten game of the season

.Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh isnt afraid to go for it on fourth down PERIOD

On the Wolverines first drive of the game redshirt junior fullback Khalid Hill punched in a oneyard touchdown on fourth down PERIOD While going for it on fourthandgoal isnt all that unexpected Harbaugh proved that he wasnt afraid to go for it more often throughout Saturdays game PERIOD

Later on while Michigan was up by  points in the second quarter redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight rushed for nine yards on fourthand7 PERIOD The more questionable part of it was that the Wolverines were on Penn States 24yard line making it a reasonable spot for a field goal PERIOD

Overall Michigan went 2for4 on fourthdown attempts PERIOD After the game Harbaugh noted that they just wanted to go for it on fourth down because its starting to happen more and more often in college football PERIOD Fifthyear senior kicker Kenny Allen despite doing kickoffs and extra points never attempted a field goal Saturday PERIOD

.The Wolverines can stop a talented back PERIOD

Penn States Saquon Barkley is the best running back Michigan has faced all season PERIOD At times he was the only player having any kind of success on offense recording  of the Nittany Lions  total yards of offense PERIOD

Still the Wolverines kept him out of the end zone and held him to  rushing yards on  carries PERIOD Penn State opted to target him as a receiver after realizing that challenging Michigans defensive line was not a good idea PERIOD Even then the Wolverines limited him to just  receiving yards in the second half PERIOD

 PERIOD The secondary is dinged up again PERIOD

Senior cornerback Jourdan Lewis made his season debut on Saturday after missing the first three games due to multiple injuries PERIOD Though its sometimes hard to quantify his impact on an opponents passing game the AllAmerican posted two tackles one for loss and one pass breakup PERIOD He was a little rusty but still stayed glued to his man for most of the game PERIOD

Unfortunately for Michigan fifthyear senior cornerback Jeremy Clark had to be carted off the field in the fourth quarter after collapsing with an apparent leg injury on a kick return PERIOD After the game Harbaugh said that it could be a torn anterior cruciate ligament effectively ending Clarks season PERIOD

.The running game is improving PERIOD

After a lackluster performance against Central Florida two weeks ago the running backs made an emphatic statement PERIOD Four ball carriers notched more than  rushing yards on Saturday combining for five touchdowns PERIOD Hill also punched one in for good measure PERIOD

Senior running back DeVeon Smith led the group with  yards on  attempts  his first time breaking the century mark this season PERIOD Sophomore Karan Higdon helped out with the best game of his career notching two touchdowns one that came off a 40yard run in the fourth quarter PERIOD

Running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley continues to prove that not just one back will get the majority of carries and so far its working PERIOD

.BOLD PREDICTION DeVeon Smith will rush for two touchdowns next week PERIOD

Though Wisconsin has only allowed one rushing touchdown this season theyre due to let a bruising back get the best of them PERIOD Louisiana State running back Leonard Fournette and Michigan States LJ Scott couldnt find the end zone against the Badgers even though Fournette had  rushing yards PERIOD

Smith isnt likely to rip off a 50yard run but his sheer tacklebreaking ability will allow him to punch in two scores matching his season total to date PERIOD
