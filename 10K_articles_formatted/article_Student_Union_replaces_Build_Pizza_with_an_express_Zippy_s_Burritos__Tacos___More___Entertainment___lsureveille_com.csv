If youre craving Zippys but you dont want to travel too far then the new addition to the Unions dining options may excite you PERIOD

The newest addition to the Union is Zippys Express a smaller version of the beloved Baton Rouge restaurant located on Perkins Road PERIOD The Zippys Express replaced Build Pizza on the second floor in the Union PERIOD
