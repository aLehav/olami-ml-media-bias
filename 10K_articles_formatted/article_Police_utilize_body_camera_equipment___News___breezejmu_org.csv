Following a national trend the Harrisonburg and JMU police forces are equipping themselves with the ability to record save and rewatch every interaction they have with civilians PERIOD Within the past year the two police departments have developed policies that put body cameras onto active officers PERIOD

The Harrisonburg Police Department has had a policy implemented since April  requiring officers all onduty officers wear body cameras at all times unless undercover according to Lt PERIOD Rod Pollard chief commander of the patrol division PERIOD

JMUs campus police force is implementing a permanent policy that theyve been drafting since March of this year PERIOD As of now the HPD doesnt own enough cameras to outfit its entire force it currently has  to  PERIOD But the JMU Police Department is planning on providing cameras to all its officers within the next few weeks according to Lee Shifflett the chief of police for JMU PERIOD

We have been writing our policy for eight weeks now Shifflet said PERIOD It is not something you can just sit down and bang out in a day PERIOD Even when the model policy came down we had probably  percent of what the model policy suggested in our policy PERIOD It is the other  percent we looked at and said Hey thats a great idea lets add this lets tweak this. police body camera technology is something thats spreading across the nation according to Pollard PERIOD

If you look over the past several decades you see technology changing the way we do business in law enforcement that in time went from absolutely no cameras to incar cameras Pollard said PERIOD With the increase in technology and the ability to make cameras smaller and hold more memory its just a transition of going from incar cameras to body cameras. the HPD uses the Taser Axon camera which comes in at a price tag of  per camera according to Tasers website PERIOD The JMU police force furnishes its officers with the Digital Ally body camera a camera that costs  per unit according to Grainger Industries an online retailer PERIOD

Pollard said that HPDs cameras are very similar to the way the cameras in police vehicles work PERIOD The camera whether in the car or on the officer is always recording but doesnt save any memory to its storage bank PERIOD In a police vehicle as soon as the blue lights on top of the car flash on the device starts actively saving its memory PERIOD For body cameras the officer hits a button to make the camera start recording and saving video when theyre having an encounter with a citizen according to Pollard PERIOD

Body camera footage thats in use during an investigation is not viewable to the public PERIOD In order to view any footage whether from JMU police or HPD an individual must submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the police department PERIOD

Shifflett is not worried about people seeing the cameras as an infringement of privacy PERIOD Shifflett sees videotaping by police officers as a form of note taking PERIOD So when theyre called into an encounter it would work in the officers and the citizens favor to have notes of what happens PERIOD According to Shifflett thats only if an officer had legal standing to be there PERIOD Other problems arise concerning officers having manual control of when their cameras are on and actively saving video PERIOD

An EconomistYouGov poll from earlier this year found that  percent of Americans support the use of body cameras PERIOD James Harkins a senior philosophy major thinks the cameras can only do good as they can provide more evidence for potential court cases PERIOD

I dont think it infringes upon my privacy Harkins said PERIOD If Im being confronted by the police theres either a good reason or there isnt PERIOD If there is a good reason then its best for me to politely present my case on camera PERIOD If there isnt a good reason then hopefully that gets across in the video PERIOD Either way I think the camera could only help me. according to Shifflett the JMU Police Department hasnt had any complaints about harassment or poor treatment by police toward citizens in the last year PERIOD Still Shifflett hopes that the body cameras will reinforce good habits by police PERIOD Coming from an administrative viewpoint Shifflett sees these as powerful training tools and to him it just makes sense to have them PERIOD

Say you see an officer who handles himself or herself in a situation just textbook perfect Shifflett said PERIOD Why not show it at the next roll call meet Say Look people we do this everyday. contact Chris Kent at kent2cmdukes.jmu.edu PERIOD
