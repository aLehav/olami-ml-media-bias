BY K.J PERIOD ADLER

Ive gotten to that point in my career as a columnist where I ask people for ideas about what sort of topics I should cover PERIOD

I mean what better means to please the public than by delivering what they want

In one such instance I was preparing a presentation for one of my English classes with an older student who had decided to come back to college after a longterm hiatus PERIOD

We were sitting in Combs contemplating how to best present the psychoanalytical intricacies found in Mary Shelleys Frankenstein when someone passed by and commented on last weeks article PERIOD

What did you write about My partner asked innocently PERIOD
Oh sex in the woods and how it could suck. i replied as I shifted through some lecture notes PERIOD I looked up to see my partners face light up PERIOD

Ha a sex column Well hon if you want any words of wisdom Im the woman for you

And of course rather than diving into our project we proceeded to procrastinate with her asking me if I had ever thought of certain sex moves and me shaking my head dumbfounded by my newlyrealized lack of knowledge on sex topics PERIOD

What about this she said smiling and shifting closer to me in her seat her next sex tip dangling on the tip of her tongue PERIOD

Pop Rocks

Pop Rocks

People who were sitting around us eavesdropping on our conversation began to snicker at this suggestion and I scratched my head PERIOD

After a few awkward insinuations and nudges finally someone just blurted out When youre giving head

Pop Rocks I have to say the idea never crossed my mind PERIOD

Sure Ive heard of doing the deed after chewing some minty gum but Pop Rocks just sound sticky and almost dangerous PERIOD

Prompted by this strange discovery I dove into the Internet to find some candies out there that could be both clean and tasty PERIOD

To my pleasant surprise I discovered that sex treats come not only with fullbodied flavors but some also hold other magical properties PERIOD
For instance there are lubricants that not only have a wide range of flavors but can also tingle and warm up your happy parts PERIOD

There are even massage oils that allow you to get out the kinks while tickling your palate PERIOD

If youre looking for something a little less slippery there also exists an invisible odorless powder that when dabbed on the skin tastes sweet and delicious PERIOD

A friend of mine once used it for a bit of sex play one night with her boyfriend PERIOD

I dabbed it in three places and told him to find them she told me one night PERIOD

Only I told him that I had put the powder on four parts of my body PERIOD He got kind of frustrated but I couldnt have cared less. along with a wide range of powders and gels with such creative titles as massage souffl body pudding and tingle gel there is also a line of undergarments that can both be worn and consumed PERIOD

However I have heard that the stuff not only tastes awful but can stain your entire mouth not an attractive feature for lovemaking PERIOD
While the candy styles are wide and diverse the tastes and quality of each product can be a crapshoot PERIOD

But despite the danger of buying a sex candy that doesnt taste quite right each product is edible and safe to roll around in unlike the stickiness of most other candies PERIOD

And while I do appreciate my project partners flare for creative candy applications I dont think the use of Pop Rocks on a persons junk is my idea of a fun time with candy PERIOD

Even whipped cream and chocolate syrup can prove to be problematic with all of the nooks and crannies of the human anatomy PERIOD

For me I would say the best bet for sex and edible items is good old water products ice cubes steam and warm water PERIOD

The possibilities are endless clean and create a sensation that almost anyone can enjoy PERIOD",Sexclamations: Candy is Too Sweet for the Bedroom â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
