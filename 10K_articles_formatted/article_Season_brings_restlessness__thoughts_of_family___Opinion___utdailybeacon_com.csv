Well it turned warm this last week PERIOD The trees have now exploded into bright

light green buds and rolled leaves that pause in their process of

stretching out to grasp the sunlight PERIOD At the house I live in the flowers

are starting to come up their pace quickened by the wind and water of a

few days rain PERIOD None of this has done well for my column PERIOD It has been so

nice that I lost my senses utterly and now am straining for something

anything to write about PERIOD I thought of mining my past for any elemental

lessons that I might have learned that I could pass on in good conscience PERIOD

Unfortunately the advice  is not

the sort of experience you or I want to relate PERIOD

I have found myself over the last week driving endlessly about PERIOD Taking the

long way into work finishing my homework early and then driving through

the darkness over roads I had halfforgotten that I ever knew PERIOD I drove

along these curving roads that were overhung with vines and still skeletal

branches PERIOD Ive felt as though driving along I was chasing something PERIOD When

I was in my senior year of high school I did the same that spring PERIOD I got in

my car and drove until late at night sometimes over a hundred miles in an

evening PERIOD The only difference now is the car and the music PERIOD The headlights

sweeping through the trees and bushes even the roads seem all the same to

me PERIOD

In the last month my fathers mother my grandmother died after a sixyear

convalescence in a home in Murfreesboro PERIOD I want to write about it more for

myself than for anyone else PERIOD When I was in my junior year of high school

she had the first of what would later become a series of strokes which in

time took her farther and farther into a world in which I imagine faces

swam in and out without providing a spark of recognition PERIOD I do not believe

she knew who I was in the last four or five years PERIOD

She lived most of her adult life in Atlanta where my father was raised PERIOD My

brother and sister and I used to go in the summer to Atlanta to see her

and my other grandparents for a few weeks PERIOD She lived in a house that as I

remember it was covered in large swathes of ivy PERIOD In the back there were

old bee hives that my grandfather had kept that still had brittle pieces

of honeycomb inside PERIOD At my parents house after the memorial we watched

old films in which my grandfather and my sister played with the combs in

front of my grandmother PERIOD

Last fall when she was very sick my father and I went to see her and

brought her fresh clothing PERIOD When we arrived she was very uncomfortable PERIOD She

was sweating and crying PERIOD I stood in the corner of the room while my father

adjusted her bed and washed away the sweat with a moist cloth PERIOD I watched

him do this so gently but I cant really convey the feeling except to say

that he loved her and you could just tell in the way that he cared for her PERIOD

It is not often that you see love in movement but I saw it then and havent

forgotten it since PERIOD

The night after she died I sat with my parents at our table and we told

stories about her and my great grandmother Bla who lived one hundred and

four years and died in the Bronx far from her Puerto Rico but close to God

and her children PERIOD My father went to visit her and he had to have an escort

through the neighborhood by my cousins PERIOD At over a hundred years old she

cooked him food because he was my mothers husband and therefore her

family PERIOD

 Says T.S PERIOD Eliot in his Four Quartets PERIOD If

only because in time as those in your family died and new are born your

own architecture becomes more complicated PERIOD The world seems streaked with

ghosts and memories PERIOD Springs past and springs future PERIOD And so I drive around

and look at the trees and the curves PERIOD The guardrail that speeds past PERIOD I

listened to the regular thump of the tires over concrete joints PERIOD I said

last semester that we love our family so much but that does not keep them

around PERIOD I was wrong in that PERIOD

Their presence is only more complicated more a part of our own

pattern PERIOD
