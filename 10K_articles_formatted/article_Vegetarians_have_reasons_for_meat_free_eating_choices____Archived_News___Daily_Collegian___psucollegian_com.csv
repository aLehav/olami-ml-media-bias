This letter is in response to the March  letter 

Im sure everyones tired of dueling meatinout letters but I feel the need to clear things up on behalf of vegetarians who have been accused of being ignorant of meat farming practices and attacking the views of meateaters PERIOD

I agree with the comment that dietary choices are based on personal beliefs which everyone should respect PERIOD As a vegetarian I also receive many offensive comments toward my beliefs PERIOD

We do not claim that all livestock are mistreated and no regulations exist regarding their safety but many people do not realize that practically all meat consumed in the United States does not come from the pretty open farms you see or may have grown up on but rather from factory farms which are a different story entirely PERIOD

Laws on humane treatment of poultry no longer exist and the socalled  when animals are mistreated are disturbingly common in factory farms PERIOD Regulations are also not routinely enforced as businesses seeking a profit are not always honest PERIOD

Additionally meat defenders fail to address the proven detrimental effect of meat production on the environment and its link to cancers PERIOD

I base all of this not on YouTube and PETA videos but on books testimonials from people who work in the meat industry research of established organizations involved in the issues PERIOD

There wouldnt be so many vegetarians if we didnt have sufficient reasons for changing our lifestyles and breaking lifelong habits PERIOD By offering information we arent trying to force anyone to take sides we simply encourage making an informed decision about the diet you choose whatever that may be PERIOD Personally I know I will never regret living a compassionate and healthy lifestyle PERIOD
