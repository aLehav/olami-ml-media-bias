Colette Pollauf news correspondentFebruary  

It may not be November but election season is still in full swing PERIOD District  City Councilor Lydia Edwards will vacate her position on April  after being elected to state Senate prompting a special election this spring to fill her seat and a debate over which candidate would be best fit for the role PERIOD

In November  Edwards the incumbent ran unopposed for her District  City Council seat and was reelected PERIOD District  covers the East Boston North End and Charlestown neighborhoods PERIOD At the same time Edwards ran for the First Suffolk and Middlesex state Senate seat winning by roughly a 20point margin in the December primary according to unofficial results PERIOD She then ran unopposed in the general election was elected to the Senate on Jan PERIOD  and sworn in on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Edwards is the first woman and person of color to represent her district as well as the only Black member of the state Senate PERIOD

Serving on Boston City Council has been an incredible honor and I am thrilled that the candidates who have expressed interest in the District One city council seat reflect the diversity of the district Edwards said in a statement announcing her resignation from the city council PERIOD

So far two candidates have formally announced runs for the vacant seat Gabriela Coletta formerly Edwards chief of staff and Tania Del Rio a community activist who recently ended her term as the executive director of the YWCA in Cambridge PERIOD Both are firsttime candidates PERIOD

Del Rio an East Boston resident with two kids in Boston Public Schools is originally from Mexico City PERIOD She first worked for the Consulate of Mexico in Boston and then served as executive director of the Mayors Office of Womens Advancement PERIOD She said her experience as a Latina immigrant in Boston influenced her decision to run for city council PERIOD

I want to provide people an opportunity to feel like they can come close to government and not feel intimidated Del Rio said in an interview with The News PERIOD I think being in this context having a city council who could understand where youre coming from speak your language and invite you in a way that you havent been before would be very important. del Rios campaign focuses on policies she thinks are the most urgent in the District  neighborhoods  mainly housing and displacement issues PERIOD

Were losing the people who were part of building this wonderful neighborhood and were part of making our present she said PERIOD They put blood sweat and tears in building our presence PERIOD They should be able to stay PERIOD And thats what were fighting for. del Rios other main points of emphasis include education equity climate justice and providing excellent constituent services PERIOD

Coletta has also worked in city government as well as activism and political organizing PERIOD Before working as Edwards campaign manager and chief of staff she was the associate director of the Massachusetts Womens Political Caucus PERIOD

She is currently the external relations manager at the New England Aquarium promoting equity and accessibility along Bostons downtown waterfront PERIOD Her main focuses are similar to Del Rios including housing education and environmental justice PERIOD Both candidates policies reflect the major issues facing District  today PERIOD

Gloribell Mota an East Boston resident cofounder and executive director of the organization Neighbors United for a Better East Boston and former candidate for state representative talked about the importance of a city councilor that meets a diverse communitys needs PERIOD

How do we make sure that resources are equitable and that the resources we have here are also being distributed equitably Mota asked saying this is something the City Council could take up to par. while Mota said she is excited about the diversity of the candidates she added she is more concerned about the values each candidate will bring to the table PERIOD

If you do have access to power and you have the responsibility to be in a position of power whats your responsibility for those that dont have a voice Mota said PERIOD

Recent events have brought this question to the forefront of the campaign PERIOD Social media posts made years ago by both candidates surfaced on Twitter this week which included racist and homophobic language PERIOD Coletta apologized on Tuesday for her posts in which she used the nword PERIOD

I am incredibly sorry for the ignorant and horrible things I said PERIOD There is no excuse she said in a statement posted on Twitter PERIOD Regardless of how long ago I used this language the harm remains. del Rio also issued a statement about Colettas posts writing that Colettas comments were hurtful to the black community and the LGBTQ community and emphasizing that words matter. a few hours later another Twitter user posted a reply to Del Rios statement with screenshots of Facebook posts she had made in  which also included homophobic and racist sentiments PERIOD

Some community leaders in East Boston expressed sympathy toward Coletta who was the only candidate affected at the time of the interviews PERIOD Mota said she hopes that the public allows Coletta space to grow and selfreflect PERIOD

I think part of being a white ally is understanding your privilege and understanding what that implies  I think she was in public service for the last five six years Mota said PERIOD How has it shown up How has your commitment to understanding the harm thats racism in that social construct has done And how have you also benefited from being able to do that

Gail Miller longtime East Boston resident and president of environmental advocacy group Airport Impact Relief Inc. agreed PERIOD She said she understood how the candidates youth at the time of the posts contributed to the hurtful language PERIOD Colettas posts were published from the ages of  to  while Del Rios were from when she was about  years old PERIOD

I just think everyones going to have to decide for themselves what that should mean in the candidate Miller said PERIOD

While the community is reckoning with how this controversy will affect the upcoming election some are questioning the wisdom of holding special elections in the first place PERIOD

I would love for these elected officials to do away with these special elections Miller said PERIOD This is our third special election backtoback and its tiring and its wearing PERIOD And worst of all I think you get voter disinterest because this is coming at them all the time PERIOD It just melds its almost like its just one campaign. that voter disinterest can have a huge effect on voter turnout according to Mota PERIOD

Theres a majority thats not been represented and so they should take that to account she said PERIOD Being elected by  or seven percent of the electorate is not representative for us for participatory democracy. for the moment however special elections still determine leadership in Boston PERIOD The future of their neighborhoods is in the hands of the residents if they choose to use the power PERIOD
