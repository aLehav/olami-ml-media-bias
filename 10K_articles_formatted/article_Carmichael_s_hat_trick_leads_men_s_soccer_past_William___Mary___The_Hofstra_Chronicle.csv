The Hofstra Pride mens soccer team came away with another win on Saturday Sept PERIOD  at Hofstra Soccer Stadium PERIOD The Pride defeated the College of William  Mary Tribe  during an afternoon matinee in Hempstead PERIOD The win came on the back of big days from sophomore Ryan Carmichael who got a hattrick and senior Hendrik Hebbeker who scored a goal and assisted two of Carmichaels goals PERIOD

With this win Hofstra is now  overall and  in Colonial Athletic Association CAA play PERIOD The Tribe have now slipped to  this season with a CAA play record  PERIOD

When you look at the end result  it looks like its been a comfortable game but far from it said head coach Richard Nuttall.William  Mary began this match with a goal from junior forward Diba Nwegbo right away PERIOD Right off kickoff Tribe midfielder Alfredo Bozalongo sent a cross over to Nwegbo who shot a screamer past Hofstra goalkeeper Wessel Speel just twelve seconds into the game PERIOD

We had a joke in the locker room PERIOD Thats the quickest goal ever scored on Hofstra soccer in my time here Nuttall said PERIOD

That turned out to be the only goal of the day for the Tribe as well as the only shot William  Mary had the entire first half PERIOD Hofstra didnt stay behind for long PERIOD At   Hebbeker sent a wonder strike past William  Mary goalie Connor Andrews PERIOD Storm Strongin got the assist PERIOD

Six minutes later Hebbeker sent a long pass up the field to Carmichael who dribbled into the box and put a goal in the back of net near the far post to make it  PERIOD

In the second half at the  mark Hebbeker passed the ball to Carmichael who dribbled through two Tribe defenders and scored to make it  Pride PERIOD

After getting the brace it didnt take the Northern Irishman to score his third PERIOD He got his third goal in less than a minute after scoring the second PERIOD After running down the end line he cut it back and ripped a shot to get his trifecta PERIOD

The hattrick was the first threegoal performance for the Pride since nowgraduate student Matthew Vowinkel scored three on Nov PERIOD   against Northeastern University PERIOD

Its always nice to score Hebbeker said PERIOD Part of what is expected of me as well is to produce goals either by assisting or scoring PERIOD If I can continue to get on the scoresheet as well I would be happy. the German senior is on fire as of late scoring three goals and getting four assists in his last four games PERIOD

Its back on the road for the Pride on Tuesday Sept PERIOD  when they head to Sweeney Field in Philadelphia to take on St PERIOD Josephs University at  p.m PERIOD
