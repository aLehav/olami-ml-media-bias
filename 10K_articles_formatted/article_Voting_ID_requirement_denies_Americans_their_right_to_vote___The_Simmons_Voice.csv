As much as we hate to admit it election day  is next week PERIOD Having this in mind it is important to reflect on the different voting processes inperson and by mail and how the current voting legislation which varies state to state reduces certain groups ability to vote in the U.S PERIOD

Before this editorial dives into evaluating voting requirements a helpful tool to find out said qualifications is Google PERIOD Type in absentee ballot process into this search engine and a helpful widget pops up with information on how to vote by state including requirements and when and where to vote PERIOD Unfortunately the voting process is not the same everywhere so it is important to complete it way in advance of election day PERIOD

According to Ballotpedia.org  states has enforced voter ID requirements as of November  PERIOD This means that the majority of states require voters to bring some form of ID such as a drivers license stateissued identification card or military identification card PERIOD The breakdown of this statistic includes  states that demand photo ID and  states that ask for other forms of identification PERIOD

Critics of states that require IDs to vote argue that they deny certain segments of Americans their right to vote PERIOD These segments include lowincome citizens racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly who often do not have governmentissued photo IDs according to the American Civil Liberties Union website PERIOD As many as  million Americans fall into these categories and are hindered from voting their first and foremost right as citizens PERIOD

Proponents of voter ID laws suggest that these rules prevent voter fraud which is a valid point but there is not sufficient evidence to back up this claim PERIOD However the lack of evidence may be due to the fact that it is difficult to detect voter fraud which Kris Kobach points out in his opinion article Voting ID laws are good protection against fraud in The Washington Post PERIOD

Republican Nominee Donald Trump has resurrected the publics concern of voter fraud PERIOD This issue however is not considered a widespread issue according to a recent study by News21 a national journalism initiative PERIOD The study found describes how  alleged electionfraud cases in  states between  and  found the level of fraud was infinitesimal compared with the  million voters registered over the 12year period. in addition the analysis discovered just  cases of voter impersonation the only kind of fraud that could be prevented by voter ID at the polls. a streamlined voting process that is the same across all  states may be a plausible solution but further research would be required PERIOD As we get ready to cast our ballots we should take the time to appreciate the power we yield by voting but also be aware of how some segments of the population will not get to exercise that right because of voting requirements PERIOD What does that say about the validity of their muted voices What does that say about America Are we the land of the free or land of the systematically oppressed
