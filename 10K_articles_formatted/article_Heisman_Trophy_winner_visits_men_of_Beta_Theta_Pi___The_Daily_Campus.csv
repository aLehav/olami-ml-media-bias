8346,2023-10-25,"everyone makes assumptions PERIOD Fraternities have patented the image of living amongst upturned chairs broken beer bottles scattered in every direction and crazy parties scheduled every night of the week PERIOD

This was what Tim Brown joked about expecting upon speaking to members of Beta Theta Pi at the fraternitys chapter meeting Sunday night PERIOD

Instead Brown a former wide receiver of the Oakland Raiders a Heisman Trophy winner and hopeful member of the  NFL Hall of Fame was welcomed by about  men in suits and ties as he explained what being a man of principle is all about PERIOD

With Beta Theta Pi still in the first months of reorganizing on the SMU campus as an active chapter the men have their work cut out for them as they work on rebuilding and overcoming a diluted reputation PERIOD

Being a man of principle is hard work said Brown PERIOD Its about taking a stand PERIOD Its about being a leader in all aspects of life. a Dallas native and graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School Brown lived a life drug and alcohol free sticking out like a sore thumb among his high school college and NFL teammates PERIOD

Brown reinforced the importance of staying focused on our purpose and setting the bar higher every day in order to truly become a group of gentlemen scholars and respected leaders in our community said junior Stephen Beckert Beta Theta Pis recruitment chair.Mr PERIOD Browns personal stories reminded us that leading by example is exactly what our founding father class needs to do to benefit the SMU Greek system and build Betas relationship with other fraternities sororities and the University. talking from personal experience about what is it like to defy expectations Brown motivated the Beta members to ignore the ridicule they are bound to receive for being a different kind of fraternity PERIOD Playing for the Raiders as a wide receiver Brown called his former team one of the most dysfunctional teams in the NFL and told the members seated in the Hughes Trigg Forum If you dont want to play the game dont come out of the locker room. dealing with unruly teammates battling back from a knee injury and keeping a clean image were just part of what has led Brown to lead such a distinguished and wellrespected life PERIOD Working on a team Brown explained is similar to being part of a fraternity and offered advice on what it takes to be successful within a group PERIOD

Be great in every aspect of your life and every aspect of this brotherhood Brown said PERIOD If youre going to be the best be the best PERIOD If youre going to set the bar high get over the bar. while the men of Beta Theta Pi set out on the task of rebuilding their fraternity chapter advisors asked Brown how the brothers could stay united in their goal of rebuilding a tainted reputation PERIOD With the Greek system already under the watchful eye of the universitys administration establishing a respectable and genuine reputation is not always easy PERIOD

When you take a stand you have to be ready said Brown PERIOD There are outside forces that upon hearing what youre trying to do will try to derail you. brown went on to say that the mens actions speak much louder than their words PERIOD Using his own organization Take a Stand as an example the University of Notre Dame alum stressed the importance of being involved and giving back to ones community PERIOD

After starting a program to stress the importance of education among young children Brown went on to say how people are not going to be interested in what the men are going to say but will only be focused on what they do PERIOD

Youre starting a legacy that years from now youll be able to look back and be proud of what youve done said Brown PERIOD Youve set the bar for fraternities and brotherhoods for years to come. brown ended his speech by instilling a sense of hope and inspiration within the men stressing that while a group of people is only as strong as their weakest link the men sitting in front of him are in an extreme position of power to do anything they put their minds to PERIOD

I believe if you all stick together and pray and talk about everything together you can make it PERIOD Nothing that is worth it every comes easy but I believe you can make it. the Independent Voice of Southern Methodist University Since
