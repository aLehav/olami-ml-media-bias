The UConn womens soccer team will open up American Athletic Conference play today as they host the Tulsa Hurricanes at Morrone Stadium PERIOD The Huskies  will be coming off a weeks rest after disposing of Fordham  last Thursday PERIOD The Hurricanes  have not been in action since a  loss to Ole Miss at home  days ago PERIOD

We are starting the conference games PERIOD We take every game very very very serious PERIOD They are a good team and everybody knows everybody now so its going to be a fight UConn head coach Len Tsantiris said PERIOD

The game will also be Tulsas conference opener PERIOD They share no mutual opponents with UConn this season but last year the Huskies beat the Hurricanes in Tulsa  in doubleovertime PERIOD In the win UConn goalkeeper Emily Armstrong picked up a yellow card and both goal scorers for the Huskies have since graduated PERIOD

Despite a fairly strong season last season Tulsa has struggled this year but junior midfielder Rachel Thun has not PERIOD She leads the team by a significant margin with  points on the season with six goals and five assists PERIOD She tracks very similarly to UConn stars Rachel Hill and Stephanie Ribeiro when looking at most offensive metrics PERIOD

Tana Dake also a junior midfielder is another player UConn will have to watch out for as she has two goals and five assists on the year PERIOD Tulsa as a team leads the conference in saves with most going to junior keeper Rebecca Defer PERIOD They also lead the conference in fouls PERIOD

Meanwhile for UConn the offense is clicking at the right time PERIOD Ribeiro a redshirt senior leads the way with  points on eight goals and five assists PERIOD Fellow forward Hill has  points on six goals and three assists PERIOD Another bright spot while seeing increased minutes and a new position freshmen Kristen Vinciguerra and Alexa Casimiro each scored their first goals in the  drubbing of Fordham PERIOD The Huskies currently lead the American in shots PERIOD

Just because its now conference play doesnt mean the Huskies will shake things up much PERIOD

No its just the games are really going to count inconference eventually so you have to win said Tsantiris when asked if UConn will change their approach at all now that they are in conference play PERIOD

The game will be a  p.m PERIOD kickoff and opens up a weekend conference home stand as Memphis will come to Storrs on Sunday to challenge the Huskies PERIOD
