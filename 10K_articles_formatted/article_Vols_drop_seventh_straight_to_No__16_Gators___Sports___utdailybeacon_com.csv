I told the team if you are going to compete for championships you are going to get scars on you Dooley said PERIOD Ive been saying this all season PERIOD We didnt have any scars on us and today we got plenty of them. the biggest scar that could linger the rest of the season is the injury to sophomore receiver Justin Hunter who hurt his left knee on UTs opening drive PERIOD Hunter didnt return and is possibly out for the rest of the season PERIOD



Its tough losing one of your goto guys as a quarterback UTs Tyler Bray said PERIOD But we still had a whole three quarters to come back and make plays which we failed to do. when Hunter went down the Vols   SEC were already trailing  PERIOD Florida   took the opening kickoff and marched  yards in nine plays for a touchdown when quarterback John Brantley found a wideopen Trey Burton in the end zone on a 3rdandgoal play from the UT 1yard line PERIOD
