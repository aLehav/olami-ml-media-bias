After seeing red hearts chocolate candies and gushy lovers one would never suspect the dark past of Valentines Day but indeed it holds one for its namesake St PERIOD Valentine PERIOD

St PERIOD Valentine was a priest in the second century of Rome who was martyred by Emperor Claudius II for two controversial reasons PERIOD

The first is one suspected by many educated authorities including Tobias Winright instructor of religion PERIOD

Supposedly St PERIOD Valentine along with St PERIOD Marius and his family were assisting martyrs when Claudius II apprehended him to the prefect of Rome PERIOD Because Valentine wouldnt worship the emperor as the almighty Lord he was beaten with clubs and beheaded Feb PERIOD   A.D PERIOD

The next belief about Valentines death is taken by the lovers of St PERIOD Valentines Day PERIOD The supporters of this theory believe that Claudius II forbid all young marriages because he thought the young men would be better suited as soldiers PERIOD St PERIOD Valentine did secret marriages to honor young love PERIOD When Claudius II found out about him disobeying the law Valentine was sentenced to death PERIOD

The story of St PERIOD Valentine continues PERIOD While he was in jail he cured the cell keepers daughter of her blindness which made her instantly fall madly love with him PERIOD On the eve of his death he secretly slipped the young girl a note which was signed from your Valentine. winright does not take on this interpretation PERIOD He claims that marriage was not an issue in those times PERIOD The original true love was agape love he says which was the love not hate of everyone PERIOD Agape love became morphed into what Valentines Day really was according to Winright PERIOD

This day seemingly transformed into how we know it today because of the Festival of Lupercalia a festival that honored Juno Feruato the goddess of feverish love PERIOD

In this festival young men and women gathered while a lottery system took place PERIOD Each person had his or her name drawn and were partnered with someone from the opposite sex for feasting and sexual games PERIOD

Obviously Christians frowned upon this kind of event PERIOD They slowly tried to turn the festival of flesh into a ritual for romance. as it changed men had to give expensive presents to the lady and the lottery progressively died out PERIOD

In  A.D. Pope Gelasius named Feb PERIOD  as the day to honor Saint Valentine PERIOD He became the Patron Saint of epilepsy because he suffered from the disease PERIOD He also became the Patron Saint of lovers as the church assimilated the fertility festival Lupercalia into their calendar PERIOD

Valentine is another martyr of the early church that I look up to Winright said PERIOD That someone had that much faith to die for their faith is important to me. multimedia Journalism Professor Lisa Carponelli is adding a new job to her weekly todo list the Saturday evening anchor at WHO  PERIOD This marks.. PERIOD
