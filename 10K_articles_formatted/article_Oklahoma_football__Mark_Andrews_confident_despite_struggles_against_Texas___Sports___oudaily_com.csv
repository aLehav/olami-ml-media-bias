Sophomore wide receiver Mark Andrews falls after attempting to catch a pass from junior quarterback Baker Mayfield during the game against TCU Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The Sooners won the game  PERIOD

After weeks of being one of the most consistent receivers for Oklahoma Mark Andrews had a nightmare game against Texas PERIOD

The sophomore from Scottsdale Arizona had just one catch for  yards against the Longhorns and also dropped a few passes PERIOD One of those drops fell into the arms of Texas defender for an interception PERIOD

 Andrews said PERIOD 

Andrews and quarterback Baker Mayfield never seemed to be on the same page in Dallas with Mayfield overthrowing Andrews a few times early in the game PERIOD

Andrews had nine receptions and four touchdowns through the first three games of the year and seemed poised for a breakout year PERIOD

However he dropped two passes in the loss to Ohio State and then reeled in just three passes in the past two weeks struggling while Dede Westbrook has emerged as a star PERIOD

 Mayfield said PERIOD 

A former fourstar recruit Andrews became the fastest Sooner to  career touchdown catches earlier this season PERIOD At 6foot5  pounds Andrews presents matchup problems for opposing defenses PERIOD

But that size advantage doesnt do the team any good if he cant make the catch PERIOD

 Andrews said PERIOD
