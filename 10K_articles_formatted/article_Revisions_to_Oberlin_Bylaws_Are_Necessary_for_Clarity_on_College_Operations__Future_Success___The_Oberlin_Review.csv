8504,2023-11-04,"lillie Edwards OC  Vice Chair of the Oberlin Board of TrusteesSeptember  

Oberlins uniqueness resounds through our history PERIOD Since its founding in  Oberlin has become synonymous with academic excellence worldclass musical instruction and liberal arts as a path to social justice PERIOD

The balance of these elements makes Oberlin unique PERIOD Oberlins community  trustees faculty staff students alumni and emeriti  embrace treasure and respect this balance PERIOD The Board of Trustees has a duty to protect it as we navigate the landscape of higher education PERIOD

This landscape is now more complex than ever PERIOD We face economic administrative regulatory statutory and even political constraints that were unfamiliar decades ago PERIOD In recent years a lack of clarity in our bylaws regarding institutional governance and the delegation of authority has hampered our ability to respond nimbly to extraordinary challenges like a pandemic and plan responsibly for the future PERIOD

The decision to clarify Oberlins bylaws is not simply a judgment call PERIOD Our existing bylaws are not aligned with the stated criteria of our accreditor the Higher Learning Commission which specifies that institutions should be clear about responsibility and decisionmaking especially with regard to the Boards delegation of authority to faculty and staff PERIOD Our risk management assessment team has identified ambiguity in the bylaws as a liability in need of addressing PERIOD

With this reality squarely before us earlier this year the Boards Nominations  Governance Committee invited the General Faculty Council to help us amend six sections of Oberlins bylaws PERIOD NG and GFC met weekly for seven weeks PERIOD

All of us participated in good faith and in Oberlins best interests PERIOD The trustees brought their sensibilities as Obies PERIOD The faculty brought insights from experience and their dedication to Oberlin PERIOD There were disagreements but also respect and collegiality PERIOD I thank everyone  faculty and trustees  for their diligence and hard work PERIOD

Trustees will consider the amendments that resulted from this process at the October board meeting PERIOD The original intent was to vote on the updates at the June meeting but GFC suggested that a vote in October would allow for more deliberation PERIOD

These changes will

 Affirm the Boards authority and establish a foundation for the delegation of authority

 Clarify the role of the president and specify the presidents authority and responsibility for the effective administration of the College

 Clarify the facultys role in the academic affairs of the College

 Clarify the process for the appointment of deans

 Update the Boards committee structure combining Student Affairs and Academic Affairs Committees into a single committee and create a new Tenure and Promotion Committee

 Provide flexibility for the College if it were to establish the position of provost subject to the Boards approval

The amendments are meant to clarify responsibilities without eliminating channels for valuable faculty input PERIOD Oberlins ongoing success depends on faculty advice to the administration and the board on matters of longterm strategic importance PERIOD The free flow of feedback from faculty participation in the Academic and Administrative Program Review which resulted in the One Oberlin plan was invaluable PERIOD

The amendments confirm the Boards delegation of authority to the faculty and its representative bodies over such important areas as the curriculum educational policy quality and method of instruction degree requirements and educational standards faculty status including the evaluation of the faculty for appointment tenure and promotion research and those aspects of student life that relate to students academic experience PERIOD The bylaws remain replete with the term shared governance and related references PERIOD Faculty representation on Board committees remains unchanged PERIOD The General Faculty Council remains listed in the bylaws as an advisory body to the president on the budget and on such other matters as the president may raise. during a Zoom meeting on Wednesday with members of the general faculty trustees collected feedback from a number of people who wished to comment on the amendments PERIOD We will share this feedback with the full board when we meet PERIOD

I can appreciate that to some at Oberlin changes to the bylaws can be jarring PERIOD The changes going before the Board serve to clarify roles and responsibilities so that Oberlin can continue to evolve as a unique institution known for its outstanding academics worldclass musical instruction and commitment to social justice PERIOD

The bylaws amendments protect this vision PERIOD They offer clarity that complements our institutional strengths PERIOD The collaboration energy and excitement that imbues campus will remain PERIOD Oberlins specialness will blossom well into the future PERIOD

Lillie Edwards is professor emerita of History and African American Studies at Drew University and a member of Oberlins Class of  PERIOD She currently serves as Vice Chair of the Oberlin Board of Trustees PERIOD
