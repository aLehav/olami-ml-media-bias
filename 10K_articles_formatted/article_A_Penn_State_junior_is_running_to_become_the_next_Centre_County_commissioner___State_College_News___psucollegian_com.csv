A lifelong resident of Bellefonte Pennsylvania Day said living in the area helped to shape his political ideologies PERIOD

Growing up Ive always been a part of politics in some form Day said PERIOD I was active in Boy Scouts of America all the way up until attending Bellefonte Area High School when I got my Eagle Scout award in tenth grade PERIOD A lot of local state and national politicians will come to the Eagle Scout ceremonies so from a very young age I was very consumed by the profiles of the figures that were showing up to these events and got a taste of what they do. the 21yearold said he has evaluated his abilities and talents for years now PERIOD

Theres no potential for me to become a doctor or anything of that sort but I want to help people Day said PERIOD The next best option for me was public service which has always come naturally to me. during his freshman year of high school Day played on the schools football team where he met the band instructor at practice PERIOD The instructor knew Day had played the trumpet in middle school and requested he join the group which he did his sophomore year PERIOD

This experience led him to become the vice president of the Bellefonte Band his senior year PERIOD

Aside from Scouts and the marching band Day was also active in student council and was class president PERIOD

Working for the county was a dream job for me in high school as many people knew Day said PERIOD At one point in my life I would like to be the president of the United States some day so I made a promise to my high school graduating class that we can have our reunion in the White House if it falls on the same year. aside from one family friend Days family has never been too interested in the political world PERIOD

My family is very far from politically inclined though they have their opinions Day said PERIOD Growing up politics was always a hotbutton issue for us but there were no immediate family members who were actively participating in any political organization or office. deciding to run for this position was a nobrainer for Day who said he enjoys working closely with his current constituents as well as community members PERIOD

Days platform is far from radical. he wants to keep taxes low and spending appropriate rather than absorbent. while he understands the might and influence of State College in relation to other municipalities in surrounding areas Day wants to give those other areas more of a voice PERIOD

I represent a very ruralminded ideology of keeping things as simple as possible and keeping things very smooth and easygoing for the Centre County taxpayers Day said PERIOD I also want to bring back jobs and revenue to this area. day believes in his ability to create meaningful change throughout central Pennsylvania and hopes voters recognize his will to do so. i run my campaign based solely around Pennsylvanias motto of virtue liberty and independence Day said PERIOD Without any of those three things our county our state and our nation would not be what it is today. the commissioner position is convenient for Days schedule assuming he wins the race because he will be graduating in spring   the same time he would take office PERIOD

Still there are tough aspects to his youthful political career as he faces an incumbent and two seasoned politicians PERIOD Nonetheless Day said hes up for the challenge PERIOD

I like challenging myself on a daytoday basis  I dont like taking things the easy way Day said PERIOD It can be intimidating PERIOD Im 21yearsold I dont have a whole lot of money to put into this campaign PERIOD Im a very retail politics kind of guyI like to put miles on my shoes and meet people door to door. you can put as many yard signs out as you want Day said PERIOD But what really matters to a voter is the amount of time you take to connect with them on a personal level and see what they want done in the community. even if he doesnt win Day is happy to get some name recognition for his career by running for this position PERIOD Already he has experienced community members excited that a person of his young age is making an effort to run for elected office PERIOD

While some people like to attack me for my age...others are very welcoming to my campaign and my candidacy Day said PERIOD

Some students feel like having another student running for office may be positive citing the importance of knowing students best interests in terms of creating change PERIOD

Some may say a college student may not be as mature as you have to be to take the position Xin Xia senioractuarial science said PERIOD As an international student I feel like its not probably my business but Im glad that a student is going for the position. john Fedorek said hes excited to see what happens in the primary PERIOD

I think its good because theres a lot of students in Centre County Fedorek juniormechanical engineering said PERIOD If he wins it would be a good representation of a big part of the population. regardless of what others have said Day hopes to have a positive impact on Centre County PERIOD

When you ask yourself What makes a good politician the only answer to me is A good person Day said PERIOD So at the very least I plan to be a good person a good community member and a good neighbor to every single resident of Centre County. a lot of people tend to put me on the backburner due to my age Day added PERIOD But if I didnt think I was the best person for the job I wouldnt be running. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
