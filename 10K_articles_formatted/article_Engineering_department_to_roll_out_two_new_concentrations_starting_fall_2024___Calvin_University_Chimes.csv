The new EES concentration focuses on creating and maintaining a more sustainable environment PERIOD

The engineering department is introducing a energy environment and sustainability EES concentration and a mechatronics concentration in the fall of  PERIOD

Energy environment and sustainability

According to Matthew Heun mechanical engineering professor at Calvin one of the primary inspirations for creating the EES concentration is the increased societal awareness about the relationship humans have with the environment PERIOD

People are becoming much more concerned about the way humans are treating the nonhuman parts of the creation said Heun PERIOD

According to Heun engineers have a pivotal role to play when it comes to reshaping the relationship humans have with the environment PERIOD Engineers can see their role in the creation of new technology which reshapes the way humans use or give back to the environment PERIOD

Beginning with Calvins Statement on Sustainability released in  the university has been making various approaches to increase knowledge and awareness on the state of the environment and what role humans have to perform in the changing environment PERIOD

The new EES concentration derives its course requisites primarily from the mechanical and civil engineering concentrations along with some additional courses PERIOD

The new EES concentration will therefore consist of several courses which are directed towards creating and maintaining a more sustainable environment such as ENGR  environmental engineering and ENGR  introduction to thermalfluid sciences PERIOD

In addition to general engineering courses the concentration would also consist of nonengineering classes such as Economics   the economics of energy and sustainability PERIOD

By introducing the EES concentration the department hopes to attract students who are interested in tackling challenges that relate to the environment according to Heun PERIOD However depending on what course a student has taken integrating into the concentration for current students could be especially challenging for upperclassmen PERIOD

Alexandria Gauss a junior studying mechanical engineering at Calvin and Diana Bracamonte a sophomore studying electrical and computer engineering are among the students interested in moving to the EES concentration PERIOD

My goal is to merge my passion for mechanical engineering with environmental engineering. alexandria Gauss

According to Gauss she has always been interested in the way mechanical engineering intersects with the environment PERIOD

Overall my goal is to merge my passion for mechanical engineering with environmental engineering said Gauss PERIOD

For Bracamonte it is her love and concern for the world that inspired her to consider making a switch in concentration PERIOD

I would love to see the world through this topic  and know what the best options are for a city  struggling with energy issues PERIOD

 Diana Bracamonte

I would love to see the world through this topic like energy in different cities and know what the best options are for a city  struggling with energy issues said Bracamonte PERIOD

According to Heun students pursuing the EES concentration are able to take a variety of career paths in both the mechanical and civil areas of engineering PERIOD

Students could take a career path where they work on the energy systems of automobiles buildings air conditioning and renewable energy or even work in existing coal natural gas and electricity production industries Heun told Chimes PERIOD

Mechatronics

The engineering department will also introduce the mechatronics concentration in the fall of  which would be a concentration that exposes students more to the working of machines and how to create and manipulate those machines PERIOD

According to Renard Tubergen associate professor of mechanical engineering at Calvin he was really inspired to create an intermediate category between the mechanical side and electrical side of the field of engineering after seeing how interested students were in the field of machine work PERIOD

The coursework for the mechatronics concentration would consist primarily of courses taken from the mechanical and electrical concentrations PERIOD

According to Tubergen the current plan is to not include courses focusing on thermodynamics heat energy and fluid dynamics in the concentration PERIOD Rather the concentration will focus on electrical courses like digital signals and PLC control PERIOD

Tubergen told Chimes that the new concentration hopes to provide students with the skills necessary to pursue a career path in any field of robotics PERIOD

Any robot any machine that builds things  has that marriage of electrical components and mechanical components and so those are the places where we apply our skills PERIOD

 Renard Tubergen

Any robot any machine that builds things  whether thats even a blender or a toaster  has that marriage of electrical components and mechanical components and so those are the places where we apply our skills said Tubergen PERIOD
