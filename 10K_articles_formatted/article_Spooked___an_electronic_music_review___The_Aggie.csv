The story of my first EDM concert

This past Saturday I attended Spooked a Halloweenthemed EDM concert which also happened to be my first EDM concert ever PERIOD I went in not knowing what to expect but the loud and energetic music was surprisingly effective at releasing stress and I actually ended up having an enjoyable night PERIOD

I arrived early so I took a tour inside Odd Fellows Hall the concert venue PERIOD It was not a grand or large place and the art in the hallway seemed classic and historical with elegant chandeliers hanging from the wooden ceiling PERIOD It seemed a little odd to host an electronic music concert in such a classiclooking place PERIOD

The show started with XAEBOR a San Diegobased DJ and because it was a Halloween themed event I was surrounded by EDM fans dressed in costumes and wearing heavy gothic makeup PERIOD As the set continued the audience got more and more energized they started dancing laughing and enjoying themselves PERIOD Even though the EDM concert setting was a new experience for me it was hard not to have a good time when I looked around and saw everyone dancing along PERIOD

XAEBORs music was explosive and fastpaced PERIOD He used lots of low bass pitches which made the sound wave so strong that I could feel my bones shaking PERIOD His strong beats had everyone in the room including me dancing along PERIOD

At first I felt selfconscious but gradually I discovered an incredible benefit to dancing it helps you relieve stress PERIOD For the rest of the set I forgot about my problems as I moved my body to the beat of those bass notes PERIOD

The next DJ was Chris The Junglist CTJ an Oaklandbased DJ PERIOD In general his set was slower in tempo but more complex and layered PERIOD He used fewer bass pitches compared to XAEBOR which made it possible for me to hear and appreciate all the intricate details of his tracks PERIOD

For one song he sampled the sound of wild animals and although I am definitely not an expert in electronic music I could tell that CTJs music was more varied in style and the transitions between each song were smoother PERIOD The audience seemed similarly engaged in his performance PERIOD

Overall the sound quality of the concert was excellent and the crowds were energetic and having a fun time PERIOD As for me after two hours of exploring the world of electronic music I decided to call it a night PERIOD As I closed the door behind me and walked into the quiet night of downtown Davis I felt content PERIOD

Not bad for my first EDM concert PERIOD
