Rallos Rule for UM students

Given that Rallo graduated from the University I obviously had to inquire What would be your rule for your past UM self She detailed that the competitive nature of college can get overwhelming at times PERIOD

Always be open to learning and keep yourself curious Rallo said PERIOD We get so anxious and we feel like we have to overcompensate and have something to prove which is so overwhelming. she emphasized that not letting ourselves get lost in a sea of competitiveness is crucial for getting through college PERIOD This is an indispensable piece of advice that college students should constantly remind themselves of PERIOD

Rallos Rule for overcoming writers block

Every writer and every student for that matter is most likely familiar with writers block PERIOD With all the writing were required to do in college words become scarce at times given that our study days plagued with hours of writing tend to feel endless PERIOD But do not fret because Rallo has the perfect solution for this detestable challenge PERIOD She suggests reading as the solution to writers block PERIOD

Find an author who continues to inspire you Rallo said PERIOD I think for a lot of people who have a literary brain it helps to read somebody who you think does a really good job at what you want to do a really good job at. whenever you feel at a loss for words just know that theres an author out there whose words will reinvigorate inspiration within you PERIOD

Rallos Rule for aspiring writers

Becoming a published author has been my dream since I was  years old so I wanted an upandcoming authors advice on how to achieve this seemingly unattainable dream of mine PERIOD

My rule is to treat everything that you ever write like your biggest hero in the world is going to see it Rallo said PERIOD I want you to treat all your writing like its going in The New York Times because you genuinely never know whos going to see it. modernday technology allows everyone to hide behind a screen and when your writing is published online literally anyone can access it PERIOD Make sure they can access pieces of writing that youre proud of PERIOD

Rallos Rule for staying unbothered

Rallo holds herself to a sacred who cares attitude PERIOD

I always say that if youre doing your best working hard and being kind to yourself and others and someone doesnt like you its a personality conflict and it has nothing to do with you Rallo said PERIOD You shouldnt want to change their opinion. we waste so much time on appearances and caring too much about what other people think of us especially in college PERIOD Its so easy to lose sight of ourselves while pondering over what other people may be thinking about us PERIOD Losing ourselves to negativity is exactly what Rallo recommends we prevent PERIOD

Rallos Rule for morning and night routines in college

If you follow Rallo on TikTok you know that she has a very long nightly routine PERIOD Nonetheless she insists that the way to go for college students is to keep it simple. pick three things three for the morning and three for the night that you would like to get done to create a sense of structure Rallo said PERIOD Managing our schedules in college can be really hectic especially because even if you have the same classes no one day looks exactly like the other so establishing a routine can become difficult PERIOD Sticking to those three things every morning and night might help to add a semblance of routine to our hectic college lives PERIOD

Rallos Rule for navigating all things college

College can easily become restless without us even noticing PERIOD The frantic lifestyle that comes with days full of classes extracurricular activities hanging out with friends putting ourselves out there and learning how to live on our own can become very overwhelming PERIOD To tackle this Rallo recommends staying present. not putting pressure on yourself to have things figured out or be perfect is really important Rallo said PERIOD She emphasizes that comparing yourself to others will just hurt you PERIOD Comparison is never beneficial and nobody has it as together as they make it seem PERIOD Live life day by day and be gentle with yourself PERIOD

Rallos Rule for The Daily

As she is a retired Daily columnist I wanted to know what Rallos rule for The Daily was PERIOD Daily staff members spend hours writing and editing pieces and it may sometimes feel overwhelming PERIOD

My rule for The Daily would be that you need to have multiple beverages she said PERIOD Its always a late night whenever youre at the newsroom and even if its not a late night or youre not there I feel like you still need beverages when you write. you heard it here first folks PERIOD As per Rallo the writing and editing process always calls for a kombucha a milkshake or a Diet Coke. rallos prerogative

Rallo is iconic in many ways PERIOD One of the many things that make her iconic is the classic phrase she includes in every one of her Rules for videos PERIOD Said phrase goes as follows

I dont know what your prerogative is. naturally I wanted to know the answer to the question weve all been asking ourselves what is Rallos prerogative

I literally use the word wrong but in my mind my prerogative is being a slay and getting my way Rallo said PERIOD Im big on the law of attraction and just being positive and creating positive vibes and energy for yourself. i think that is proof enough as to why so many viewers are drawn to Rallos energy PERIOD She genuinely doesnt care about things that lie outside of her control and above anything she sticks up for herself PERIOD Thats a damn good prerogative if Ive ever heard one PERIOD
