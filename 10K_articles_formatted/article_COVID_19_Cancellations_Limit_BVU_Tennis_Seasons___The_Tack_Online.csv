Cancellation after postponement after delay has marred the Fall Sports seasons for BVU PERIOD

Throughout COVID19 riddled competition the Beaver Mens and Womens Tennis teams have persevered and fought pointbypoint and eventual meetbymeet for this chance to improve before the Spring or in some cases their last collegiate season PERIOD

Advantage Buena Vista PERIOD



MEN

The Beaver Mens Tennis team led by fifthseason Head Coach Brett Groen found themselves on the receiving end of badly served luck PERIOD

Although our season was shortened by the pandemic I was still very happy with the progress of the team as a whole PERIOD We were able to get a lot of practice time in even if we didnt get any dual matches in PERIOD We had some breaks here and there with players being quarantined but instead of letting us get down at the situation we just adjusted and did more one on one type of practices says Groen PERIOD

Setting a season goal of more total wins in match play than past years seven Groen and the squad comprised of eight Beavers set out to claim their first victory of the year in Orange City Iowa against Northwestern PERIOD

However COVID19 complications saw the potential meet get canceled before the Beavers could hit the road PERIOD

History then repeats itself twice more as the next two weeks and matchups for Buena Vista against Iowa Central and Morningside would suffer the same unfortunate fate PERIOD

Cancellation and loss of competition PERIOD More importantly for Groen the team lost the opportunity to improve PERIOD

Despite the continuous setbacks Groen and the team set their sights on the American Rivers Conference Individual Tournament taking place back on September  in Des Moines PERIOD

On the day the Beavers impressed toptobottom PERIOD

Without much match time to prepare for the tournament I was very pleased with how the team performed. at the C singles spot each of our athletes got to play a lot of tennis that day and it was fun to watch them get better each time they took to the court says Groen PERIOD

Freshman Sam Musman stood out at the tournament for Buena Vista taking four victories and securing a thirdplace finish in the C Flight only losing to the eventual champion from Luther PERIOD

Similarly Kris Mintle also notched a big win as well on the day PERIOD Overall Groen was impressed with his teams effort and ability to overcome extenuating circumstances all season PERIOD

The standout of the day was the thirdplace finish by freshman Sam Musman from Minnesota says Groen PERIOD He adds He played steady all day long and hit some welltimed shots at big moments to get to the semis before his first loss then had the strength to come back and win one more match for the team.Groen notes that the team has turned their focus over winter break to qualifying for the American Rivers Conference team tournament in the Spring PERIOD Despite missing out on the tournament by a lone win two years ago and the cancellation of the competition due to COVID19 last Spring the Beavers remain steadfast in their ability and consistent improvement PERIOD



WOMEN

On the other hand the BV Womens Tennis team enjoyed an eventful and exciting Fall notching a pair of wins in a season cut in half and their most in a year since  PERIOD

At the helm for the Beaver Ladies is secondyear Head Coach Dan Taylor who felt that his squad also dealt with adversity in stride PERIOD

There were numerous changes and challenges we dealt with this season due to COVID19 says Taylor PERIOD We also endured more significant matters such as having to shut down practices for over a week and wearing masks while on the court for a few weeks PERIOD But it was all worth it so that we could still have a season and compete. the Beavers began their Fall competition with a trio of canceled matchups much like their counterparts in the Mens side PERIOD

After matches with Concordia Doane and Northwestern were all called off the Women got to compete for the first time during the Fall against conference rivals Coe on September  PERIOD

Despite taking an  defeat the Women bounced back to take two points from Loras and Simpson and just fall short to Morningside  to begin October PERIOD

Undeterred and improving every meet the squad fired past Grand View in a resounding  victory over the Knights on October  to claim their first win of the season PERIOD

Points taken over the Knights came in the form of victories from Alexis McGinnis Nicole Lange and company impressing their Head Coach PERIOD

It was wonderful to see the improvement from last season to this season PERIOD The quality of our teams play increased as did the number of players on our roster says an enthusiastic Taylor PERIOD He adds We dont have any Seniors so the entire team will be returning next year PERIOD If they continue to work hard and improve they would have a shot at breaking into the top half of the conference. buena Vista would ride the wave of momentum into the next week taking on Nebraska Wesleyan in Lincoln on the road and then picking up both their second win of the season and first American Rivers Conference victory since  PERIOD

One goal we had which we accomplished was to get a conference win PERIOD It had been  seasons since this team was successful in conference duals so to get over that hurdle was huge PERIOD I think we would have gotten a second one against Dubuque as well had we been able to play that match says Taylor PERIOD

Finishing the season with an  loss to the Central Dutch the BV Women ended match play with a record of  and began to prepare for the ARC Individual Tournanet on October  PERIOD

Junior Nicole Lange once again stood out for her side taking the B Flight Singles title with    and  victories PERIOD As a team the  Women roster snagged  vicotries as well PERIOD

Junior lexis Bruns also fought her way to the quarterfinals of the consolation brakcet and Sophomore Deanna Schaffer earned two hard foguht victories PERIOD

As the season concluded with yet another cancelled matchup with the Dubuque Spartans Lange led the Beavers with an overall tally of  while Bruns finished at  PERIOD
