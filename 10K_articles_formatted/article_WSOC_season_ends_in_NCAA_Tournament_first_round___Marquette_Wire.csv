It was Lavelles goal that ended Marquettes season as Wisconsin claimed a  victory in the first round NCAA Tournament game PERIOD

It hurts right now head coach Markus Roeders said PERIOD You dont like to feel pain for the team and you dont like to lose for the players for the seniors PERIOD Thats always the hardest part when you get to this point and abruptly your season is over. lavelle opened up a backandforth game with a blast from the edge of the box that beat Maddy Henry at the far post PERIOD The 30thminute tally was Lavelles teamleading sixth goal of the year PERIOD

Caroline Fink put the pressure on early for Marquette when she sent a longrange laser on frame that forced Caitlyn Clem into action PERIOD

The Golden Eagles best chance of the match came in the 36thminute when Darian Powell got in behind the Badger defense PERIOD She couldnt quite control the bouncing ball and Clem was able to come sweep it away PERIOD

Some days its just not your day you know and I think that kind of happened to us Powell said PERIOD We had some chances you know PERIOD Me personally I had a chance and just couldnt put it away today PERIOD I mean its disappointing but Im proud of this team and what weve done PERIOD Weve had a great year. in the final  minutes of the match Leah Celarek gave Clem a challenge on a long ball that was seeking the top left corner of the net PERIOD A few minutes later Carrie Madden rose up for a header in the box but her attempt missed wide PERIOD The flurry of chances Marquette usually produces never really came PERIOD

These are never great games Roeders said PERIOD Somebodys going to win at the end but it never turns into a good entertaining soccer match. marquette finished the season with a  record and a share of the BIG EAST regular season title PERIOD The loss dropped them to  alltime in the NCAA Tournament PERIOD
