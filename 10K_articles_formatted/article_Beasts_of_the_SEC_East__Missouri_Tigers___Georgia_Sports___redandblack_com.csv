Offseason Storylines After a less than stellar  record in their first full season in the SEC the Missouri Tigers had arguably the most disappointing offseason of any team in the conference PERIOD Though the clearly talented Tigers team of  may have outperformed expectations the offseason proved just how difficult it is to establish ones self in the SEC PERIOD Whereas in Missouris former conference the Big  their 41stranked recruiting class would have ranked seventh bringing in just one fourstar and no fivestar recruits earned the Tigers last in the SEC by a margin of  schools PERIOD Pinkel will have to step up Missouris recruiting game as far as the class of  is concerned PERIOD

Strengths For the Tigers their greatest offensive asset could arguably lie not in the players but in the scheme they run PERIOD Missouris spread offense while not unprecedented in the NCAA has no true comparison in the SEC East which can make gameplanning difficult PERIOD Missouris skill positions are starstudded with the elusive James Franklin returning at quarterback the conferences most electric return man Marcus Murphy assuming the duties at running back and receivers Marcus Lucas and Dorial GreenBeckham last seasons respective receiving yards and receiving touchdowns leaders setting the edge PERIOD Defensively former AllBig  cornerback EJ Gaines and tackling stalwart Andrew Wilson lead an experienced unit returning seven starters PERIOD

Weaknesses Though Missouri was a defensively sound team in  the teams ability to stop the run will be a question mark in  without first round draft pick Sheldon Richardson eating up multiple blocks in the middle practically every play like last season PERIOD Rather Wilson and the rest of the linebackers will likely see more direct blocking from guards and tackles creating larger holes and forcing more defenders into the box PERIOD Richardson played like a oneman defense for the Tigers last season and it will be interesting to see how they rebound without him PERIOD Offensively as electric as Murphy may be he is still an unproven commodity as a feature back and it is unknown whether or not carrying the bulk of the rush offense will lessen his return abilities and weaken the special teams as a result PERIOD

Matchup against UGA With Missouris biggest question mark matching up with UGAs biggest strength it would be an easy assumption to presume that the Bulldogs old man football will once again reign victorious but a few other factors should first be considered PERIOD Yes Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall should be able to dominate a Richardsonless defense but one can also argue that Missouris greatest strength their passing game may match up against one of the Bulldogs biggest question marks as well in the secondary PERIOD That being said many of Georgias unknowns are already considered more talented than Missouris known talents and a less athletic Missouri team could crumble in the second half just as they did in  PERIOD

Bottom Line In  Missouri won three of its four FBS victories by a margin of one possession and was blown out by three or more touchdowns four times PERIOD Losing big and winning small is a direct indicator of natural regression PERIOD When that is compounded with the loss of three contributors on the defensive front seven and an abysmal recruiting class the near and distant future does not look good for Missouri PERIOD Perhaps the Tigers would benefit from a little old man football PERIOD
