1540,2023-10-27,"all TCU PERIOD All the time PERIOD

After a hot start TCU volleyball could not keep up with the attack of the Kansas State offense and they fell to the Wildcats      in their final match of the season PERIOD

I thought we came out really strong head coach Jill Kramer said PERIOD And then I thought we were just maybe just like a step behind in a lot of facets of the game for whatever reason. the Horned Frogs started on fire ripping off on an early  run to go up  early in the first set PERIOD They then seemed to go cold offensively allowing Kansas State to climb back to tie the match at  PERIOD

Down the stretch Walsh came alive for the Horned Frogs with all three of her first set kills in TCUs last nine points PERIOD Her strong play gave the team the strength they needed to outlast the Wildcats and win a tight first set  PERIOD

Walsh would finish with  kills . blocks and a . hitting clip in her last match as a Horned Frog PERIOD

Her Walsh impacts been huge throughout her career here Kramer said PERIOD We relied on her heavily for offensive firepower blocking all kinds of stuff. although TCU would play well offensively for the rest of the match their defense could not hold off the onslaught of the Kansas State hitters PERIOD

The Wildcats would go on to have attack percentages of  percent  percent and  percent in the next three sets respectively PERIOD

Their offensive numbers are crazy Kramer said. in set three we had  kills and we didnt win the set PERIOD Thats unheard of. kansas State outside hitter Kylee Zumach destroyed the Frogs with  kills and an outstanding . hitting clip PERIOD Outside position player Gloria Mutiri and outside hitter Brooke Heyne also pitched in  kills and  kills for the Wildcats PERIOD

With  kills and  digs from outside hitter lan McCall TCU was able to put up enough offense to hang with KSU but not enough to finish sets and the Horned Frogs dropped the match  PERIOD

MacLean finished with  digs four kills and two service aces in her final match PERIOD

Shes MacLean just done anything she needed to do to help this team all year long regardless of what position we put her in Kramer said PERIOD

Libero Berklie Baker added  digs to lead the Horned Frogs on defense and middle blocker Katie Clark had  kills while hitting . pERIOD

TCU finished the season with a  record while going  in Big  play PERIOD

If you watched this team last year and you watched this team this year you know how much better we truly are Kramer said PERIOD Weve made a lot of changes lot of growth lot of development.",Wildcats offense too much in Horned Frogs season finale | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
