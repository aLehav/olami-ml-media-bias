The book details a life of love devastation and activism that inspired a movement PERIOD For those who dont understand the hashtag or are interested in recent history When They Call You a Terrorist is accessible and endearing food for thought PERIOD

Julia Modell Staff WriterFebruary  

Biographies are easy reads PERIOD Its inherently interesting to read about a life that produced intellect heroism or art PERIOD But a good biography is insightful with the power to contextualize history and reframe the present PERIOD

Patrisse KhanCullors new memoir When They Call You a Terrorist takes this historical approach and lacks no heart because of it PERIOD The book is coauthored by Asha Bandele with whom she partnered on written pieces in the past PERIOD KhanCullors is most famous for starting the blacklivesmatter movement along with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi PERIOD She grew up in South Central Los Angeles at the height of the Reagandeclared war on drugs in the 1980s PERIOD KhanCullors got involved with the Strategy Center at age  where she honed the art and activist skills she uses today PERIOD

The book details a life of love devastation and activism that inspired a movement PERIOD For those who dont understand the hashtag or are interested in recent history When They Call You a Terrorist is accessible and endearing food for thought PERIOD

Its not always easy to ingrain history the way it is taught in school PERIOD Biographies have the power to pull readers into history connecting them to the people within the events PERIOD

We can read reports like The Sentencing Project which lists the U.S PERIOD as the world leader in incarceration with . million currently behind bars PERIOD We can read that although crime has not shifted dramatically the number incarcerated increased by  percent in the last  years PERIOD We can read about the number of people with mental disorders in prisons compared to health centers PERIOD

KhanCullors pulls us into her journey as her friends family and community members face the harshest application of the law PERIOD She shows her brother Montes journey in jail as he is routinely beaten denied water and put in solitary confinement after a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis PERIOD She details continually losing Monte to the prison system from which he returns more broken each time a secondclass citizen in the eyes of the law PERIOD

There are studies that examine the lack of resources in communities of color but it is hard to understand the human effect PERIOD KhanCullors makes it easy by walking us through her childhood without parks grocery stores beyond 7Eleven or parents who can afford to stay home from their third jobs PERIOD

She takes us to the makeshift alleyway playgrounds that kids created and were routinely frisksearched in PERIOD Kids in her neighborhood were locked up for talking back tagging smoking weed underage drinking or literally wearing the same Tshirt PERIOD KhanCullors shows the targeted policing behind the war on drugs and gangs for what it is a continuous war on black communities PERIOD

People throw around big terms like the prison industrial complex but KhanCullors illustrates the way prisons are filled and whom they directly benefit PERIOD She explains the laws that give police impunity to search each black body they set their sights on PERIOD She describes the small towns where prisons are the big industry and the big corporations that profit from the nearlyfree labor PERIOD

KhanCullors talks about learning to lovein many capacitieswhile a target is trained on your back PERIOD She reflects on what it means to love deeply for people seen as expendable in the systems at play PERIOD

KhanCullors writes When hate and the harshest version of living dominate when even the worst assaults are blamed on the victims when bullying has become ever present limitless we have come to say that we can be more than the worst of the hate PERIOD This is what we mean when we say Black Lives Matter. the word terrorism is used in a way that distorts all meaning KhanCullors explains how a life can be intentionally streaked with terror and how those in power can flip the term and at any time call you a terrorist PERIOD
