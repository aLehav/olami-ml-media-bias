The discussion featured a panel composed of notable politicians such as the U.S PERIOD House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and U.S PERIOD Rep PERIOD Joe Neguse PERIOD

The conversation opened with an acknowledgment of Boulders own history with gun violence such as the  shooting that killed  people at a local King Soopers PERIOD

This is something that has impacted Boulder as well so its not just something national said panelist Dr PERIOD Reiland Rabaka a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at CU Boulder PERIOD

Rabaka referred to the Boulder bubble the citys reputation as a fairly idyllic safe community PERIOD Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty also touched upon this concept PERIOD

There is no community immune from gun violence and in Boulder we know that all too well Dougherty said PERIOD

The discussion also focused on potential root causes of the nations uptick in gun violence PERIOD

We use the metaphor of the tip of an iceberg to talk about and help us understand those root causes of gun violence said Dr PERIOD Beverly Kingston the director of CUs Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence PERIOD

When you think about that iceberg the tip is gun violence PERIOD Its the homicides the suicide the mass shootings the things that make the nightly news Kingston said PERIOD

According to an analysis by Pew Research Center more than  of murders in the U.S PERIOD in  involved a gun PERIOD For suicides in the same year almost  involved a gun PERIOD Kingston continued on to describe the issues that she thinks need higher media attention and political focus when it comes to the issues driving gun violence PERIOD

Then we can go even deeper underwater we can look at those social structural forces those broader forces like poverty racism and collective trauma Kingston said PERIOD

Members of the nonpartisan volunteer group Moms Demand Action attended the panel and were among those for whom the lack of attention beyond the tip of the iceberg was an important talking point PERIOD

City gun violence does not get the attention that mass shootings do does not get the attention that it needs to said Christina Gardner the local group membership lead and survivor network lead for Moms Demand Action PERIOD Definitely mentioning city gun violence but not just mentioning it but also actually ensuring that our representatives and that our leaders are focusing on it PERIOD That is what the focus should be. members of Moms Demand Action attend CUs conference discussing gun violence on Aug PERIOD   PERIOD Jessi SachsCU Independent

Another issue that was discussed as a potential root cause of gun violence was the accessibility of guns both on a state and federal level PERIOD

We have  of the worlds population but more than  of the worlds civilianowned guns Neguse said PERIOD We believe that means that we have probably about  million guns circulating throughout this country. jeffries who noted that he was speaking on behalf of House Democrats also discussed the nature and usage of guns within the U.S PERIOD

We also believe that they are weapons of war that have no place in a civilized society Neguse said. these are weapons of war that are not used to hunt deer PERIOD Theyre used to hunt human beings. the panel also shed light on recent triumphs towards improving gun safety throughout the nation PERIOD

Weve been providing free gun locks and free gun safes in the community Doherty said PERIOD In our office and I know other places throughout Boulder County we have restorative justice and diversion programs where we have the opportunity on low level offenses to help kids get on a better track. i know were here today to talk about something heavy and difficult but its also the first time in my career as a prosecutor where I feel like we have momentum for change Doherty said PERIOD
