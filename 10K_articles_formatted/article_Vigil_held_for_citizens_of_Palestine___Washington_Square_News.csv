Students vocalized their dismay towards a feeling of antiPalestinian culture within the NYU Law School on Friday PERIOD

Thomas Peracchio Staff WriterNov  

NYU Law students gathered for a silent vigil on Friday to show solidarity with Palestinian citizens in their ongoing struggle with Israel PERIOD The vigil held in the NYU Laws Vanderbilt Courtyard also aimed to bring attention to Palestinian suffering and the Law Schools alleged proIsraeli sympathies PERIOD

Students brought large black signs handed out flyers and posed for pictures PERIOD The event was sponsored by Law Students for Justice in Palestine one of NYU Laws newest student advocacy groups according to Law student Colinford Mattis PERIOD

Law Students for Justice in Palestine was one of several new student groups created last year PERIOD It tries to open a dialogue about the PalestinianIsraeli Conflict Mattis said PERIOD LSJP does advocacy work and strives to raise awareness. salmah Rizvi another NYU Law student said the demonstration tried to bring attention to the current issues PERIOD

Todays event was prompted by recent activities on Palestinian land in particular the extrajudicial killings of Palestinian citizens Rizvi said PERIOD

In addition said Law student Amith Gupta the effort to raise awareness was further spurred by a series of emails exchanged between law students PERIOD

I called for vigils like this after the aggressive response I and other students received for forwarding emails from the organization New York City Students for Justice in Palestine Gupta said PERIOD The forwarded email showed solidarity with the Palestinians during their recent uprising against the Israeli occupation. gupta also pointed to NYU Laws adoption of Thane Rosenbaums Forum on Law Culture  Society in  as evidence of the schools animosity toward Palestinians PERIOD In a July  opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal Rosenbaum suggested that all citizens of the Gaza Strip could be considered combatants PERIOD

On some basic level you forfeit your right to be called civilians when you freely elect members of a terrorist organization as statesmen invite them to dinner with blood on their hands and allow them to set up shop in your living room as their base of operations Thane wrote at the time PERIOD At that point you begin to look a lot more like conscripted soldiers than innocent civilians PERIOD And you have wittingly made yourself targets. rizvi agreed that she felt the presence of a proIsraeli bias on campus but saw promise in the student organizations PERIOD

At times it has been a struggle for proPalestinian advocates on campus to speak out in a meaningful way Rizvi said PERIOD However the administration has been supportive PERIOD We are one of very few law schools with a group like Law Students for Justice in Palestine. gupta also noted proIsraeli sentiment on campus and suggested that it occasionally veered into hostility PERIOD

The community here can engage in a culture of dehumanization of Palestinians and others in the Middle East Gupta said PERIOD ProPalestinian students can be called antisemitic or branded terrorist sympathizers PERIOD This language can have a chilling effect on students willingness to participate in discussions and express themselves PERIOD By speaking out we are doing our best to address it. mattis also said organizations like LSJP could have positive effects on community discourse PERIOD

I am interested in supporting activities that can bring a voice to the marginalized Mattis said PERIOD In a diverse and academic community like NYU Law we need to stand up for cultivating discourse PERIOD We need people to feel empowered to engage. a version of this article appeared in the Nov PERIOD  print edition PERIOD Email Thomas Peracchio at emailprotected PERIOD

Its nice to know NYUs journalism school honors press freedoms PERIOD

Freedom of the press and speech was intended to protect the rights of those with dissenting opinions PERIOD  No entity needs to protect the rights of those voicing the popular viewpoint PERIOD

Evidently NYUs editorial board believes their mission is to delete the dissenting opinion that of arguing why this Palestinian charade is dishonest and morally bankrupt PERIOD

Congratulations NYUs editorial board for turning your back on the First Amendment and for dishonoring the journalists most important role  that of honoring individuals the right to voice the contrary opinion PERIOD",Vigil held for citizens of Palestine - Washington Square News,New York University
