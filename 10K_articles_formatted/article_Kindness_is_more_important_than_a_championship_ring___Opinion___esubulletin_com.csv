A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I remember my boyfriend and I showing up at a party to watch Super Bowl LVII on Sunday Feb PERIOD  just after the halftime show PERIOD Despite having little interest in sports I can tell you that during the second half of the game as the Kansas City Chiefs were starting to make their comeback I was even on the edge of my seat PERIOD

As someone who has more interest in watching the commercials and Rihannas pregnancy announcement I couldnt help but notice the reactions of those around me during what will go down in history as the infamous Tubi commercial of  PERIOD

If you were one of the . million viewers likely fooled by the Tubi Super Bowl commercial dont feel too bad as I was also trying to figure out who sat on the remote PERIOD If you are not a fan of American football let me fill you in PERIOD

The commercial was  seconds long and opened on a clip of two Fox Sports reporters Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olson chatting about the game PERIOD All of a sudden a popup browser with different streaming apps appears at the bottom of the screen and changes the channel to Tubi TV PERIOD

A list of movie options then was shown and the film Mr PERIOD and Mrs PERIOD Smith featuring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on the cover was chosen PERIOD Personally I would have preferred the movie PERIOD

Despite what I thought most other Americans were quick to raise voices at their family members and friends to figure out who had changed the channel in the middle of the game PERIOD

In the days that followed the commercial news stories TikToks and other social media posts were made about the tension in U.S PERIOD homes during these few seconds PERIOD Families and friends yelled at each other bartenders were cursed at and overall people reacted with anger at whoever was in charge of the clicker PERIOD

This prank while amusing raises one big question that we all should be asking why are we so angry

Research over the years has found that domestic violence tends to be at a higher rate during the Super Bowl than other days of the year according to jezebel.com PERIOD When I first heard about this I couldnt wrap my head around why this would be the case PERIOD

As someone who was raised in an abusive household I started reflecting on my own experiences PERIOD I asked myself what kinds of emotions are evoked during sports games that would cause this PERIOD

More alcohol is usually consumed during big games and at least half of viewers will be upset by the result of the game meaning many will go to bed that night in a bad mood and possibly wake up feeling equally as bad PERIOD

Upon further research I found that Americans arent the only ones who have experienced the violent phenomenon PERIOD After France was defeated in the  FIFA World Cup finals by Argentina riots broke out in the streets resulting in police using tear gas on French citizens according to cnbctv18.com PERIOD

So what is the root of the problem Is it sports Alcohol Or is it just human nature to react like this I cant give you a complete answer as I am only a journalist at a small college newspaper but one thing is for sure  the commercial was more than just an amusing moment for Tubis marketing department to be proud of PERIOD It was a social experiment that reflects how our society reacts when our screens are interrupted PERIOD

With this said its my belief that we can all work on becoming kinder more understanding humans in  and if someone accidentally changes the channel during next years super bowl I hope we can all have the patience to speak softly to one another and not be bystanders PERIOD Kindness is more important than a championship ring PERIOD
