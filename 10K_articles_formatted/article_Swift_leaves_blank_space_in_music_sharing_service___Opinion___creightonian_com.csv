A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I knew it was trouble when my Taylor Swift Spotify search pulled up surprisingly few results PERIOD

One of my roommates and I had just been talking about how hard it was to find Swifts new album  anywhere on the Internet PERIOD Many of the lyric videos of Swifts new songs have been removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement. then there was the Wall Street Journal oped in July where she said Music is art and art is important and rare PERIOD Important rare things are valuable PERIOD Valuable things should be paid for. the moment I knew I could no longer find any of Swifts songs on Spotify I had a feeling they wouldnt be coming back anytime soon PERIOD

Sure enough on Monday Spotify announced that Swift had cut ties from the popular musicstreaming service taking all of her music down from the site PERIOD

I agree that artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their work PERIOD But in this day and age with so many ways for people to download music it is not that simple PERIOD It is not realistic to expect all users to pay for all the music they listen to PERIOD

Before the Internet revolutionized musicsharing people did not have the luxury of having multiple ways to share music files PERIOD While people could listen to music on the radio via music videos on MTV or on a CD player the only way for people to transfer music was though a physical medium such as a CD PERIOD

Now through the rise of musicstreaming sites such as Spotify YouTube Rhapsody and Beats Music everything has changed PERIOD Songs can be played instantaneously and more frequently than ever before PERIOD Before she pulled her music from Spotify  million users had listened to Swifts songs in the last  days PERIOD

Should Swift be paid the same amount for each of these unique listens as she would be if someone forked over the . to buy the song on iTunes I dont think so PERIOD Artists may create music but they still need mediums for people to be able to listen and share their music PERIOD If these mediums can be more cheaply and easily produced than they were in the past and they are part of the process that gets the art to the consumer then shouldnt the price of music be cheaper

Taylor Swift also is not some indie artist who needs every penny she can get just to be able to continue to make music PERIOD Its curious as to why Swift decided now was the time to cut ties with Spotify PERIOD

Shake it Off was released on Spotify shortly after the single was released at the end of August PERIOD If this was something that Swift firmly believed in why did she continue to support Spotify just a few short months ago

Rolling Stone hinted at the possibility that the decision which was made by Swifts record label Big Machine Music had something to do with the fact that the label is about to potentially be sold based on information from an inside source PERIOD The labels founder Scott Borchetta could be pulling Swifts music from Spotify to sell more albums and thus increase the labels value before the sale PERIOD If this is true Big Machine Music is trying to get more money but it has nothing to do with supporting all artists PERIOD

Swift is trying to launch a noble crusade but in reality she is only doing something that really only a superstar like herself can do PERIOD With music becoming increasingly easier to stream getting paid for every single listen is something that is just not possible in todays world PERIOD

Rather than shut out Spotify completely if Swift truly cares about all artists being paid for her work she should work harder to work with and not against Spotify PERIOD Musicstreaming services are not going anywhere anytime soon so I dont think that Swift will be saying we are never ever getting back together to Spotify PERIOD
