The Center Square  At the Republican primary debate last week presidential hopefuls disparaged the state of education in the nation with some candidates advocating for the abolition of the U.S PERIOD Department of Education and the promotion of school choice options PERIOD

Its an issue that seems sure to reappear as voters signal strong concerns with the quality of traditional public education PERIOD The Center Square Voters Voice Poll conducted by Noble Predictive Insights found that more Americans are dissatisfied than satisfied with the quality of education at their local public school PERIOD

The poll of  voters found that  were satisfied with the quality of their local public schools education and  were dissatisfied PERIOD The poll asked  Republicans  Democrats and  independent voters about their views PERIOD

Moderates who lean Republican had the highest dissatisfaction rate  followed by voters who identified as strong Republicans with a  dissatisfaction rate PERIOD Of all Republican respondents  said they were dissatisfied PERIOD Of Democratic voters  were dissatisfied PERIOD

According to Mike Noble founder and CEO of Noble Predictive Insights such a polarized issue can lead to Republicans and Democrats changing their perception of satisfaction on an issue based on who is in the White House PERIOD

The big thing on education you got to look at the tiebreaker which is the independents Noble said PERIOD Independents are seven points in the dissatisfied realm so independents are leaning a little bit towards Republicans on this issue. of those who approve of President Joe Bidens performance  said they were satisfied with public education PERIOD Of those who disapprove of Biden just  said public schools were satisfactory PERIOD

Noble said that voters in the southern region of the United States were more dissatisfied with the quality of education with  expressing dissatisfaction PERIOD Those in the countrys northeast region were most satisfied with  expressing satisfaction with the education system PERIOD

As debates continue into election season its clear that education will be a talking point especially for the GOP according to Noble PERIOD

Education has become a kind of battleground and you see obviously its become a political football  Republicans have a bit of an edge over Democrats currently on this wedge issue Noble said PERIOD
