By  Jacob OnakJuly  

The U.S PERIOD mens soccer team has once again been crowned Gold Cup Champions PERIOD

Sunday Brek Sheas 69thminute goal earned the States its fifth Gold Cup title and extended its current win streak to  PERIOD

The Gold Cup had a number of story lines one of the biggest being the return of Landon Donovan PERIOD

Donovan came back to the United States taking a break from professional soccer to get his mind right PERIOD When he returned to LA Galaxy his play wasnt as inspiring as most had hoped so the Gold Cup was a good test for the veteran  a test he aced in my opinion PERIOD

Throughout the tournament it was clear Donovan was hungry PERIOD He broke the  national team goal and  assists milestones and became the goto guy when it came to penalties PERIOD He showed Jurgen Klinsmann he deserved to be called into the upcoming World Cup qualifiers in September and won the Golden Ball of the tournament which is given to the MVP of the Gold Cup PERIOD

Another story line was the impressive depth the United States showed in this Gold Cup PERIOD Klinsmann called in players who were fighting for spots on the A squad if you will and there were a number of players to step up PERIOD

In goal Nick Rimando didnt have much to do but he also didnt make any mistakes PERIOD He showed his comfort with the ball at his feet and secured the third goalie spot behind Tim Howard and Brad Guzan PERIOD

In defense I thought Michael Parkhurst had a quiet but solid performance PERIOD With Steve Cherundolo coming back from injury to reclaim the top right back spot Parkhurst will have to battle it out with Brad Evans and Timmy Chandler for the second and third spot but the Gold Cup did him no harm PERIOD

In midfield the story was the emergence of Mix Diskerud and the return of Stuart Holden in the center PERIOD Diskerud earned himself a callup for the September qualifiers as well as pushed himself into a spot where he can slot in for Michael Bradley or Jermaine Jones if needed PERIOD

Holdens return to form was shadowed with an early exit from the Gold Cup final PERIOD The Bolton man came up limping after a challenge with a Panamanian player in the twenty-third minute PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD staff said it was a knee sprain but the MRI showed that he had torn his ACL in his right knee PERIOD Your heart went out to Holden when you saw him with his head in his hands on the bench PERIOD The Houston native had just found his form again after having to sit out for two years to recover from ligament damage PERIOD

Up top Chris Wondolowski came in a threeway tie for the Golden Boot awarded to the player with the most goals in the tournament PERIOD Wondo tied with Donovan and Panamas Gabriel Torres with five goals PERIOD Wondo didnt do himself any harm but was ultimately replaced by Eddie Johnson in the semifinal and the final PERIOD

The Yanks looks stronger and deeper than I have even seen them and it seems Klinsmann is finally delivering the type of soccer he promised from the start PERIOD
