Since before the advent of the Air Buddies movies people have recognized that tiny fuzzy animals are really cute PERIOD So naturally when one of my friends got an adorable puppy suddenly everyone needed a baby mammal PERIOD

Dont get me wrong it was awesome PERIOD This sudden desire for pets meant that I could cuddle and play with a wide variety of fuzzy woodland creatures PERIOD

The best thing about these animals apart from their adorable faces and natural tendency to lower your blood pressure was that they were all strays PERIOD

Not only were my friends cool for having a pet they were also awesome for rescuing them from turmoil homelessness and a rough life of crime on the streets of Davis PERIOD

Similarly to The Blind Side but with less football and more fur PERIOD

The only problems with owning  or in my situation pet sitting  a young enthusiastic animal are the likelihood that youll get mauled and the huge responsibility that comes with raising a pet PERIOD

Im not kidding about the mauling either PERIOD My friends dogs would bite everything PERIOD Beyond the usual chew toys and occasional sheet of homework these dogs chewed our shoes the chord to our lamp and even managed to bite my housemates boob PERIOD

We found that having a puppy is surprisingly similar to having an infant PERIOD They cry a lot need constant attention poop whenever they feel like it and they have the potential to choke on anything PERIOD

And since they cant talk youre forced to try and read their mind to figure out what they need PERIOD

Thats not even mentioning how fast they grow PERIOD People tend to assume that little baby animals will stay little but my friends pit bull Luna is proof that one week can mean the difference between being able to get on the couch or not PERIOD

But the bills that come along with owning pets are more frightening and important than everything else PERIOD You have to pay for food collars leashes litter and of course a neverending assortment of toys PERIOD

Vet visits are yet another essential but expensive part of caring for our furry friends PERIOD Having proper vaccinations and health checkups can save your pets life but making sure to spay or neuter your pet means that youre helping to stop the cycle of abandoned animals PERIOD

There are so many amazing animal rescue groups out there dedicated to finding loving homes for discarded pets PERIOD Unlike the people who get their animals from their friends my best friend adopted a devilish and fluffy kitten named Puck from a rescue organization run by crazy cat ladies PERIOD

Its difficult to describe the women who run the rescue but I should start by saying that I watched one of them have an earnest conversation with a cat PERIOD They meowed at each other for a full five minutes PERIOD

I still wonder to this day what they were talking about PERIOD

To adopt a cat my friend had to fill out a 10page questionnaire and undergo a CIAstyle interrogation with the master cat lady to make sure the friend wasnt a cat murderer PERIOD

It was one of the most uncomfortable conversations Ive ever witnessed but I appreciate why the lady constantly insulted my friend by implying that she was a terrible pet owner PERIOD

She said I speak for the cats. what she meant was that it was her responsibility to make sure the animals would never be in a situation where they needed to be rescued from again PERIOD

As I said before part of the difficulty of owning pets is their inability to speak PERIOD They rely wholeheartedly on us to keep them happy healthy and safe PERIOD

But sometimes even the best intentions go awry PERIOD People like me and my friends can mean well when adopting a pet but not realize the amount of responsibility that comes with raising a living thing PERIOD

There are so many complications that come with owning pets PERIOD Both the joy and stress of pet ownership come from overcoming the obstacles learning how to fix the problems PERIOD

So I think its time to embrace our furry friends and enjoy a good game of fetch in the park  or not you choose PERIOD

KATE ZARRELLA wants to hear your crazy pet stories at kazarrellaucdavis.edu PERIOD

This column might be the best one yet PERIOD  On behalf of every Davis parent  thank you Kate Zarrella for recognizing what it took to get you smart College students furry or not into college PERIOD  Having pets is parenting practice no doubt PERIOD

I have to footnote sometimes Rescue people get stuck in their love for the animals they rescue and hold onto them too tightly rather than taking  a risk and going with gut instinct PERIOD As did the folks at Milo rescue in Berkley who took a chance on me and put a sweet albeit goofy dog into my life PERIOD He is one happy healthy silly dog PERIOD  years laterhe is no longer afriad of his food bowl PERIOD

Good job great article
