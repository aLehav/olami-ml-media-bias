Et tu Orchard Hill

Lets just go through the run down real quick a new recreation center the best GrabnGo in Berkshire zrooms and the nicest looking beach in all of western Massachusetts provide the scenery for the one of the best atmospheres on campus in the Southwest Residential Living Area PERIOD With over  students living here it is impossible to not see someone new everyday PERIOD While the campus as a whole is not very diverse there are more people of different backgrounds ethnicities orientations and majors down here PERIOD And we have a skyline PERIOD

I am not going to talk about the other living areas because quite frankly the residence halls have more similarities than differences PERIOD We just have a larger home base down here PERIOD

The generalization of Southwest residents goes something along the lines of us being drunks immature party animals jocks inconsiderate noisemongers and slacker students PERIOD

Thats debatable PERIOD

Every dorm has that guy at parties PERIOD Every dorm has obnoxious residents who blast really bad music too loud PERIOD Every dorm has those students who dont go to class PERIOD
And surprise to even those residents people up in Central play drinking games dont ask how I know PERIOD But Southwest still has that edge that dominates the rest PERIOD

For my fellow city lovers Southwest is the closest housing center in farmland we have to being in a city PERIOD I like an urban environment and Southwest fits that need PERIOD

Personally I cannot sit still for five minutes let alone live in a mostly quiet area PERIOD I like to know that people are around me that no matter what there is always something going on like in Southwest PERIOD Sure there are nights where I want to yell out my window on the fourteenth floor of John Adams tower and tell some people to shut it but Ive felt that everywhere on campus PERIOD But this part of campus feels like its alive PERIOD I think of Southwest as similar to the Learning Commons in the DuBois Library it is relatively noisy but with enough resources and space to feel comfortable to get things done PERIOD

I have friends in Orchard Hill and Central who say they could not focus over here PERIOD With thousands of students living here I would not be surprised to know that at least one person does not like Southwest PERIOD Let me then make this clear there is no problem with not liking Southwest PERIOD There is a problem however with saying other areas are better PERIOD

Down here were close to the fields a healthy walk from our classes and have the best DC on campus Berkshire Franklin isnt that bad either so Ill give them that PERIOD

Something else I love about Southwest is the impeccable timing of construction work PERIOD Five weeks left of school until over two months of summer vacation and most of Southwest South gets sealed off for rebuilding PERIOD People also sound sarcastic down here which can be funny PERIOD Sometimes PERIOD

Say what you want but I love Southwest PERIOD Besides do you really expect to ever live in place that fits your desires  percent Sure you do Just come down to Southwest and well give you a fun time of meeting new people having a nice view in a tower getting your degree eating well and living life on the south side PERIOD

See you at the bottom of the hill PERIOD
