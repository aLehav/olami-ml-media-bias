Sam Calhoon junior in FAA and outreach advisor for Arpeggia said the mission of the organization is to provide accessible education for students in the community and to offer individualized musical lessons PERIOD Calhoon said many of the students would otherwise not have the opportunity to get private lessons PERIOD

There are many barriers to getting sufficient music education that may discourage students in the ChampaignUrbana community according to Nicole Quek sophomore in Business and Arpeggia outreach committee member PERIOD

Music lessons are often expensive ranging from 3060hour Quek said in an email PERIOD Finding a trustworthy instructor and transportation to and from lessons is difficult PERIOD Billing and scheduling are another inconvenience. once a week Arpeggia mentors provide a onehour program to students PERIOD Within this time frame  minutes are set aside for private lessons and the other  minutes are used for group lessons PERIOD Lessons can be geared toward choral or instrumental needs PERIOD



The nonprofit RSO is made up of  active members of which  fulfill the role of mentors PERIOD Mentors are University students who lead the music lessons each week PERIOD Many of the mentors are music education majors but that is not a requirement for the position Calhoon said PERIOD

In an email Quek said Arpeggias mentors give students the ability to control their own learning experience PERIOD

For example if a student learning guitar would rather spend a lesson learning how to start on trumpet were willing to switch gears and get them started Quek said PERIOD

Arpeggia functions in tandem with the already existing Urbana Middle School SPLASH program PERIOD According to the Urbana Middle School website SPLASH provides additional academic support as well as STEM and enrichment classes both before and after school PERIOD

By functioning with the SPLASH program transportation is already provided and Quek believed the students feel more comfortable taking lessons in a familiar school environment PERIOD

Arpeggia mentors are wellequipped to teach both instrumental students as well as choral students Calhoon said in an email PERIOD Our mentors come from a range of majors but many are music majors. in addition to mentors an outreach committee and program development committee support the RSO PERIOD

The program development committee creates the curriculum for the lessons PERIOD According to Calhoon the committee and the mentors work together to create individualized plans centered around each students interests PERIOD

Arpeggia got its beginning after winning the  Startup Weekend hosted by Founders in  Quek said PERIOD Looking to the future Arpeggia hopes to expand its programs into more schools PERIOD

Vu said he believed Arpeggia to be an important asset of the community due to its dual impact on middle school students as well as University students PERIOD

Not only do the younger students get free lessons but mentors get experience in teaching leadership and they have the opportunity to apply the teaching techniques that they learn in school as theyre learning them Vu said PERIOD

Both Quek and Vu said they believed providing a creative outlet for young students is one of the main benefits of Arpeggias mission PERIOD

As a music education major I believe in the power of music Calhoon said PERIOD I believe music is such a constructive force PERIOD In my life thats been true PERIOD I know for others its a part of our culture its part of our daily life PERIOD I think having young students and giving them the opportunity to receive that education and just have a tiny piece of music in their life is absolutely essential. emailprotected",Arpeggia equips CU students with accessible music education - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
