As students returned for the fall  semester they discovered several aspects of campus life had changed including student compensation PERIOD The change from hourly pay to leadership awards was announced last spring with impacted organizations being presented their leadership award amounts by members of the committee that investigated student compensation PERIOD

Lisa Holliday associate dean of students and director of student engagement and leadership was a member of the committee PERIOD Holliday described leadership awards as Financial aid awarded through the accounting office. the awards will be in two payments during the semester one on Oct PERIOD  and the second on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD According to Holliday the formula for determining the amount of the award for each position was the estimated hours of work per week multiplied by the minimum wage for Marion County which is . pERIOD Associated Students of Willamette University ASWU Treasurer Michael Burke  said that awards will increase over time with a committee meeting yearly PERIOD Oregon minimum wage is scheduled to increase each year PERIOD

According to Holliday the legal text the decisions for leadership awards have been based on is an excerpt from the Department of Labor Field Guide on when there is an employee relationship PERIOD Section 10b24 University or college students says  University or college students who participate in activities generally recognized as extracurricular are generally not considered to be employees within the meaning of the Act. according to Holliday the tasks and responsibilities of positions determined if it was to be paid hourly or by leadership award along with the text from the Department of Labor PERIOD

When asked about his experience on the committee Burke the sole student involved said that most of the committee work was about how much to pay students PERIOD Burke said It was never much of a discussion about the leadership award parts and thats primarily because again thats something that came down from legal counsel and HR trying to follow Oregon labor law. according to Burke the decision of who to pay with leadership awards compared to who was hourly also came down from Human Resources and Willamette legal counsel PERIOD

Since the spring presentation there have been changes in the leadership awards for certain positions PERIOD Within ASWU theres been a change in who is compensated PERIOD ASWU Justices were not included in the initial presentation of leadership awards for ASWU while Senators were with a  award per semester PERIOD Then Chief Justice Sam Johnston   said that regular justices should be compensated an amount similar to Senators PERIOD For the fall  semester Senators will not be compensated but Justices will with a leadership award between  PERIOD According to Burke the change is due to ASWU not having the funds to compensate Senators PERIOD Burke said there is a plan to ask Vice President of Student Affairs Lisa Landreman to move up the student fee marginally to help secure the funds needed to pay senators and other positions currently being underpaid PERIOD

Community Service Learning CSL had their awards adjusted due to inaccurate reporting of the hours worked each week by those involved in CSL PERIOD Sadie Horner  a CSL Service Learning coordinator said that previously CSL was compensated hourly working  hours a week with a cap at  hours PERIOD The original leadership award for CSL was paying for two hours of work a week and the new award amount is  per semester significantly less than what they were making according to Horner PERIOD Horner said that last year CSL was told they could receive leadership awards but were not told the amount PERIOD

Horner a firstgeneration and low income student said she thought her two jobs with CSL and as a library circulation assistant would be enough to take care of herself but with the new leadership award its not PERIOD Horner sent out a set of slides against Leadership awards in early September and created a petition calling for them to be changed PERIOD Shes heard some students are happy about the two payments because they can save it but said Thats fine if you can afford it but doesnt take into account students of lower socioeconomic status. horner further expressed frustrations regarding the implementation and lack of transparency saying that she found the administration response to issues dismissive and based around a belief that upset students do not know whats going on PERIOD

When asked about the student response Burke said that he was at a few meetings where organizations were presented the changes and the amounts for their positions PERIOD They were either very quiet or upset about it which is understandable because its hard to be paid twice a semester PERIOD I think there wasnt a ton of listening in a lot of those meetings that came together about where parts of this are coming from PERIOD Like how the university is broken in different parts its not just one decision made by this committee. burke also mentioned he knew there was a graphic circulating that had good sentiment but misinformation and he wishes the individual had talked to him first PERIOD Burke said the graphic was incorrect in claiming that the formula was not used and that he was present for the math saying it took a while PERIOD He said the graphic misunderstood who was responsible for the change and that it was not solely the committee PERIOD

According to Burke the primary benefit of leadership awards is that leadership positions still get paid as it would be legal for student leaders to not be paid since they are not considered employees PERIOD While Burke agrees with the frustrations of being paid twice a semester having to pay rent himself he believes they picked good times to send out payments PERIOD He added that the payments are not taxable and now go straight to bank accounts instead of student accounts PERIOD

When asked about what the student response has been Holliday said that she believes it depends on the group explaining that some organizations did not share the change in compensation with some students and so those unaware of the change have expressed concerns and questions which Holliday understands PERIOD Holliday said I think that the original reason that we came together is the important reason is looking at this with an equity lens and making sure that students who are in leadership positions are being compensated in a consistent manner. wild turkey population thrives in Salem urban areas
