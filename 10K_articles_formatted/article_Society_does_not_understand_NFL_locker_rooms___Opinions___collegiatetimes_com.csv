Youve most likely heard about the bullying case that has plagued the Miami Dolphins football team PERIOD

In case you havent Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito has been accused of bullying and harassing fellow offensive lineman Jonathan Martin PERIOD Martin left the team once the accusations were made public PERIOD

Evidence has come out that Incognito used racial epithets around Martin through voicemail and text message but many in the Dolphins locker room have come out and defended Incognito saying that this is normal amongst NFL players and that Martin sent similar messages to Incognito PERIOD

Dolphins players have claimed it is Martin who is at fault saying he shouldve said something before leaving the team PERIOD Incognito has since defended himself claiming he was Martins best friend and that Martin shouldve come to him about any issues PERIOD

Although he regrets using the racially charged terms and using vulgar language Incognito doesnt believe he was bullying Martin PERIOD And Incognito has a point PERIOD

Its obvious that such language shouldnt be used at any time but that is the nature of the NFL locker room PERIOD

The NFL locker room is not your normal workplace setting PERIOD Here  young men hit each other in practice almost daily and hit opposing players on game days PERIOD

These men are some of the strongest fastest and meanest people you will meet PERIOD They have to be able to psyche themselves up for one game per week and grind through a tough  game schedule PERIOD That does not include the offseason workouts and practices PERIOD

The locker room is a very tightknit group and these players often look at each other as extended family.They have to have trust their teammates and feel comfortable around them off the field if they are to trust them on it PERIOD Such a tight and comfortable group of players is sure to joke around with one another and use sarcasm that could be considered odd PERIOD

To the public the sarcasm and jokes these players use comes off as weird inappropriate and wrong.Yet put into the context of these men its normal.Theyve been around this all of their lives PERIOD

Simply put these men are brothers PERIOD They dont see the issue with the words PERIOD

The NFL locker room is something that we as society will never be able to understand PERIOD I am in no way absolving Incognito of using the words he did but who am I and who is society for that matter to tell NFL players how to run their locker room Were not there PERIOD We dont grind out offseason workouts and grueling practices with these men PERIOD

Society has no basis for telling NFL players how they should act in NFL locker rooms PERIOD That is up to the players themselves PERIOD

We do not have all the facts in this case as Martin has yet to speak publicly about the issue PERIOD But one thing is quite obvious Martin wasnt comfortable with the locker room atmosphere PERIOD

Martin Incognito and the other Dolphins players are all responsible for this situation PERIOD After all its their jungle not ours PERIOD
