Kiarra Williams recently showcased her collection of sculptures titled But what does it mean in the FORM gallery PERIOD The soontobe graduate aspires to be an art therapist seeking to help people work out their problems through art PERIOD

A naturalborn artist working in mediums including painting drawing and clay Williams is a multifaceted creator PERIOD Over the years Williams diverse work has included little trinkets shes made for friends drawings and sketches on Snapchat and her art Instagram PERIOD The work in this show is different however as it demonstrates more intention skill and passion with regard to the artist PERIOD

The space was filled with stoneware clay figurines placed in positions that reflect their slightly ominous one word titles Despair Fear Frustration SelfPreservation Euphoria Grateful and Breakthrough. all of them tell a personal journey that she has experienced throughout her senior year and life overall PERIOD Everything in this room is like everything that Ive been through Williams said PERIOD

The room was strategically designed to tell a story of failure growth and acceptance as well as the pitfalls and triumphs that occur along the way PERIOD From right to left the pieces travel from negative to positive in emotion starting with a piece entitled Broken and ending with Breakthrough. broken the first piece is simple but features a visual that weighs heavy on the viewers heart PERIOD A ladder is propped in the corner leading to nowhere but at the bottom lies the bottom half of a human body  cracked separated and splintered PERIOD The display was a clever choice in design leaving the crumbs where they lie letting them scatter how they see fit PERIOD

Another favorite from the show is SelfPreservation a piece with a prop that anyone can relate to a mirror PERIOD A small figure is sitting hunched over looking in the mirror with a hand to its head PERIOD Its much for the mind and soul to digest but in the best ways PERIOD We all know what that feels like PERIOD Weve been in front of that mirror just thinking about all the things you shouldnt be Williams said PERIOD

As friends and family alike gathered in Calkins that day one could feel the warmth of the artists passion see the results of her work in others and see her potential to grow not only as an artist but as a healer PERIOD
