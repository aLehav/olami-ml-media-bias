Terry Wang has a telescope and he sent me an email on Sunday night saying Why dont we have a little viewing of the moon said Mike Graf chairperson of BCs physics department PERIOD We sent out some emailsI expected about eight or  lonely souls to show up at  a.m. and we have to be about . wang a physics major who organized the event said he and his high school classmates often used to observe the night sky in their astronomy club PERIOD

I feel like its also my responsibility to organize such events in BC as well Wang MCAS  said PERIOD Finally weve managed to get two telescopes so everyone can share a piece. with the help of BCs physics department ONeill Library and his friends Wang said he organized the eclipse viewing in only three days PERIOD

Antonio Zilvetti MCAS  said he found out about the eclipse viewing from his leader in EcoPledgea sustainability club at BC PERIOD It was his interest in astronomy that propelled him to get out of bed to see it he said PERIOD

Ive kind of always been interested in astronomy but really not ever  able to express that kind of interest Zilvetti said PERIOD You can see the moon and stars sometimes depending on which city or this is just something different. avery Suza MCAS  said although he still does not completely understand what a lunar eclipse is his friends inspired him to attend the viewing PERIOD

I was in physics lecture and my professor  told us in class that there is a watch event going on and I was like Okay cool PERIOD Im gonna go to this thing Suza said PERIOD So the only reason why I woke up early is because my friends showed up but its kind of worth it PERIOD I think its really pretty. though Suza said he still does not really understand what causes a lunar eclipse it was cool to see PERIOD

I dont know why it turns red Suza said PERIOD Im still confused about that but Ive never seen a lunar eclipse before PERIOD Ive always seen a solar eclipse so this is just really cool. although lunar eclipses are not extraordinarily uncommonthe next one is in 2025the beautiful clear night skies made Tuesday morning ideal for viewing the blood moon eclipse Graf said PERIOD

The next viewable one will be in about three years so its not super uncommonits not a Halleys Comet kind of thing every  years but it is relatively uncommon and its a beautiful night Graf said PERIOD Who knows what itll be in three yearsmaybe its cloudy or rainy PERIOD So everything lined up literally and figuratively for this viewing. nEWS SPORTS ARTS MAGAZINE NEWTON OPINIONS MULTIMEDIA
