Hunter McDaniel  Thursday March  

After taking three of four games at the Alamo Irish Classic last weekend Notre Dame heads into spring break looking to build on its newfound momentum PERIOD

Junior righty Ryan Smoyer who has opened the season with a . eRA in two starts said the way his team was able to win two close games last weekend should give them confidence heading into a tough stretch PERIOD

Its great especially the comebacks those walkoffs Smoyer said PERIOD The game where we gave up the lead late and were able to battle back and grab that win is huge PERIOD It really gives the pitching staff confidence to know that we can come back and get bailed out by our hitters PERIOD They did a great job all weekend at having really good atbats PERIOD

Especially in the beginning of the season it just seems like the bats across college baseball are a little behind PERIOD To know that we have that kind of support behind us not only in the field but at the plate is a great feeling. over the first weekend of break the Irish  hit the road for the USA BaseballIrish Classic in Cary North Carolina at the USA Baseball National Training Complex PERIOD

Notre Dame will face opponents from four different conferences at the classic including Alabama  on Friday Brown  and Bucknell  in a Saturday doubleheader and Niagara  to conclude the Classic on Sunday morning PERIOD

While each of these teams will present a specific challenge to the Irish the Crimson Tide who have won their last six games will arguably be their toughest opponent PERIOD

Then following the conclusion of the USA Baseball Irish Classic the Irish will head to Louisville the following weekend to take on the No PERIOD  Cardinals  in a threegame series kicking off ACC play for both squads PERIOD

This weekend Alabamas an SEC team with a lot of potential and Louisville is ranked pretty high in the polls across most of college baseball Smoyer said PERIOD To have those teams this early is challenging but it also puts the task upon us to raise our level of commitment as far as our work goes day to day PERIOD The focus we put into our preparation with those kinds of teams is a great challenge that were ready to take on and especially with the talent those teams bring its going be a great test to see what were made of right away PERIOD Hopefully down the road it helps us out. following the end of the a stressful midterms week Smoyer said being able to focus on baseball should help the team gel early in the season PERIOD

Were gonna be travelling a lot over spring break Smoyer said PERIOD We have a little bit of a bus ride from North Carolina to Kentucky when were in between those two weekend series but for our routine it doesnt really change much PERIOD  Its just a little more down time PERIOD Guys get to kind of hang out and decompress from the stress of the academics that have been hitting us at the end of this half of the semester PERIOD It kind ofgives us that mental break and allows us to focus on something other than academics for a little while. the Irish will play seven road games over break before returning for their home opener against Toledo on March  PERIOD

The USA BaseballIrish Classic gets under way Friday evening as Notre Dame facesAlabama in Cary North Carolina PERIOD
