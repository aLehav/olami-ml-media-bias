Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Aaron BrooksOctober  

A year ago Jessica Jenks a former colleague of mine wrote a Halloween column reminding students that Your cellulite love handles stretch marks and cankles are not attributes that should be flaunted PERIOD Luckily Im reminding you to start working out now if you want to put on plastic fangs and a bikini and call yourself a vampire. in my opinion Jenks column is worthy of repetition but in addition to exercising your physique to prepare for Halloween students should work out their insecurities as well PERIOD

As explained by Jenks college women unfortunately have few options for Halloween costumes PERIOD Although they can choose from mainstream costume options like nurse maid or cheerleader without being creative or spending money on an elaborate costume all women usually look like is a sex worker. as reasoned by Jenks if you are going to look like a sex worker you might as well look like an appealing one and that is true PERIOD Even I at  years old find it difficult to control my impulse to yell KoolAid at a snuggly dressed Red Riding Hood PERIOD

You only have threeandahalf weeks before Halloween weekend and although that is not a lot of time exercise can make a difference PERIOD Women who may need to tighten up a bit for their costumes should alter their routines to include more cardio PERIOD Men Although society does not hold us to such a high standard we should include a couple more reps to buff up our biceps PERIOD

Only retain the exercise reminder if looking good matters to you PERIOD Just because you may run into some immature drunkard who may call you a sugary drink does not mean you should stay home free of criticism PERIOD

Halloween is the only holiday that is better as an adult PERIOD Do not let a few extra pounds stop you from booooogieing down  PERIOD The most important part of your Halloween costume is not how you look in it but how you act in it PERIOD

As Kevin Reynolds junior political science major advised If you fulfill your costumes role it will be more fun especially if you have a partner or a group to play off of. besides you are in college PERIOD Most college students understand genetics affects an individuals weight and the students who do not are usually those who are failing their classes the one thing that should be made fun of PERIOD

Speaking of which at least I have exams and research papers due Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Check your syllabi and if you find yourself similarly situated get your studying done before Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

A few other tips are to go and return with a group make overnight accommodations ahead of time and bring a change of clothes PERIOD There is nothing more embarrassing than walking home at  a.m PERIOD dressed as the Hamburglar PERIOD
