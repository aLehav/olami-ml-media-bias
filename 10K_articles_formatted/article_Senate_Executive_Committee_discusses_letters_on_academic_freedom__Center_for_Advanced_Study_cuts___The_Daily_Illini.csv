While the letters have been acknowledged the committee does not plan to respond to them individually PERIOD

Our proliferation of these statements in defense of academic freedom is that theyre all good but I dont feel we need to sign on to every one of them he said PERIOD

OBrien said he doesnt believe action should be taken to make changes to any of the policies questioned in letters about the AUP PERIOD

We dont think we need to do anything in relation to it he said PERIOD We already have strong language in our statutes and the AUP policy is clear on this PERIOD I think we can just file this and move on. progressing to a new agenda item SEC member Peter Schiffer said the Universitys Center for Advanced Study CAS plans to reduce the number of staff they have but it does not plan to change how the programs are administered PERIOD

Programs held by CAS include a series of speakers from on and off campus a symposium or conference as well as a faculty and graduate student seminar in the spring semester according to the CAS website PERIOD

He estimated the total cost of the staff and programs is between  and  PERIOD

To my mind that is too much Schiffer said PERIOD

In order to limit costs CAS will reduce the number of staff members and current faculty will take on those staff members duties PERIOD This should allow CAS to allocate more funding for academic programs while giving less to administration he said PERIOD

This is an administrative budget decision not an academic decision he said PERIOD
