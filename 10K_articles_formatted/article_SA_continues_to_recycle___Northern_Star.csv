Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Jean DobrzynskiMay  

NIUs Student Association is organizing a recycling program beginning today and lasting until May  for those NIU faculty and students with an over abundance of endoftheyear used papers PERIOD

Rachel Vallenga assistant director of SA recycling said the SA will place black bins for paper around DuSable Reavis and Wirtz halls PERIOD Bins also will be placed outside some of the residence halls PERIOD

Notebooks old tests envelopes and computer printouts can be placed in these bins Vallenga said PERIOD

If the professors do not want to put confidential material in the bins for obvious reasons they can call the SA office and we will pick it up between May  and May  she said PERIOD

Vallenga also said the residence hall curbside pickup will take place this Saturday at the usual time PERIOD However next week it will be changed to Friday May  because of the early closing of the residence halls PERIOD

If students want individual pickups from their floors they can call the SA office as well as the professors she said PERIOD

This is the first year we have done this so I dont know how much to expect she said PERIOD Im hoping for a big turnout. anyone who wants a confidential pickup or has further questions can call the SA office at  PERIOD
