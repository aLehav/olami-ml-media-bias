Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

Its candles and teddy bears PERIOD Its screaming protesters and hands stretched in the air PERIOD Its posters reading black lives matter. its Ferguson Missouri and it seems to have too quickly slipped our minds PERIOD

In the wake of the summer it was almost odd that no one had mentioned Michael Browns murder until this past Friday PERIOD With Ferguson as the subject for its first Fresh Friday of the school year the Cultural House aimed to remind educate and challenge the Macalester community PERIOD Nestled in beanbag chairs and tucked into couches Mac students set aside their evening for what was a long awaited conversation PERIOD

In fact I think it was definitely due time for it said Biftu Takele  one of the attendees PERIOD

The Cultural House staff as part of the DML worked to create a gallery walk which would depict an unbiased and multifaceted view of the events in Ferguson PERIOD Yet it wasnt easy to bring something so controversial into an intimate and safe setting PERIOD

When we were deciding what to include in the gallery walk there were plenty of opposing and very triggering and upsetting viewpoints Kelsey Larson  one of the coordinators said PERIOD

Larson Dagmara Franczak  Samia Habli  and Charles Birge  worked together to combine different perspectives into one event PERIOD Stations included walls of images and artwork tables of news articles laptops replaying video clips posters with statistics and prompts to encourage journaling and questioning PERIOD Attendees were instructed to be silent and to spend their time in the gallery as they wished PERIOD

During the silent gallery walk Franczak found herself watching visitors as they viewed her video compilations PERIOD

We were so curious about how people were reacting to it Franczak said PERIOD She said she couldnt help but stare at viewers whose faces completely changed from one clip to the next PERIOD

Franczak along with the other Cultural House staff members had to be very careful to remain unbiased PERIOD Thus it was important for Franczak to mix videos of comedians with videos of news reports to provide layers of different arguments and opinions PERIOD

Many attendees lingered and revisited the two muralsa collection of images telling different stories behind the same murder PERIOD Much like Franczak Larson found herself striving for diversity of sources PERIOD Selecting political cartoons news images and individual artist works allowed viewers to pick and choose which images they would use to compile their own visual memories of Ferguson PERIOD

Yet the photographs videos and works of art the Cultural House staff chose were not shocking PERIOD They resembled photographs that constantly appear in newspapers and on our Facebook feeds PERIOD The ways in which photographers artists writers and even comedians chose to depict Ferguson were not distinct PERIOD Yet its for this reason that attendees were so moved PERIOD The event wasnt only about Ferguson and how we can remember the events of this past summer PERIOD

Yeah we were talking about Ferguson Habli said PERIOD But also we were thinking about how that is also reflected in our own communities whatever that may be to usif its the Macalester community or even wherever a home is. while it may be important to look to art as a means of comprehending or coping with Ferguson whats more important is to ensure that we arent just watching PERIOD We cannot just remember the imageswe must keep talking PERIOD

I think we can call ourselves successful if we continue to have the conversation Takele said PERIOD Just dont let this event leave our memory. the Student News Site of Macalester College
