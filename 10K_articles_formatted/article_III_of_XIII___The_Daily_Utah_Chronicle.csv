I walked into Autzen Stadium still deluding myself that the Utes had a chance at the BCS PERIOD Nothing could be further from the truth PERIOD

Its true they had shown questionable playing skills the last two games still managing to scrape through with wins PERIOD But like all diehard Utes fans I still hoped they would pull through PERIOD However when Terrence Cain threw an interception to the Ducks in the last few minutes of the fourth quarter I felt empty PERIOD After watching our teams mediocre performance the entire game there was no desire to beat up the Ducks quarterback just desolation PERIOD The 16game winning streak was over PERIOD

Remembering back to  I went to every game but one the third game PERIOD Ironically enough the Utes game against Utah State was the one I missedfor a game at the y of all things PERIOD Can you believe it A staunch Utes fan like myself missing a game for an inferior rival team who I might add we beat in a blowout game last year But the chance to work with the Sports Illustrated photographer Bill Frakes8212a once in a lifetime opportunity for an upcoming sports photographer8212was too sweet a temptation to pass up PERIOD
Since I started taking sports photos as a mitigating factor against the slim chances I had of playing them professionally I have dreamed of working at SI PERIOD I learned a lot from Bill even though I spent the day watching the y beat UCLA in a blow out never a positive experience and carrying around extra cameras and lenses PERIOD
As I drove back to the airport and Bill slept I turned the radio on to the Utes game and the fan inside of me started wishing I could be in Logan with the team PERIOD Lennie Mahler took my place at the game that ended up being a blowout for Utah8212 just as I had expected PERIOD










But this year did not go as well PERIOD Last week was the first time I had ever gone to Oregon PERIOD I drove more than  hours roundtrip and barely made it in time for the game PERIOD Driving through Oregon and Idaho was a tiring and boring experience and I arrived with a sore butt PERIOD Oregon drivers cant merge at all from what I saw so we lost an extra hour of the trip PERIOD We passed the time by making up headlines for what a game with the South Carolina Game Cocks playing the Oregon State Beavers would be PERIOD
We arrived at the stadium just as players were being announced but by the time we parked and my camera equipment was set up I had missed the kickoff PERIOD Jostling my way to the field was the first of many horrific moments as I watched the Utes punt the ball and the Ducks take it to the house for six PERIOD It took away almost all confidence I had for that game PERIOD





Nonetheless the Utes had pulled through in worse straits including the brilliant game against TCU last year PERIOD And scoring  points in  seconds left Autzen stadium in stunned silence8212a nice change if youve ever been in that eardestroying stadium PERIOD It makes  fans sound like  PERIOD



But instead of intercepting the ball like we had done against BYU so many times in the past that had me applauding their quarterback with atypical love and affection for his red colors showing forth our beloved team gave the ball up in the last few minutes PERIOD
I watched as the Utes walked off the field as if they had just watched a puppy hanging by its neck from a tree all bloody and beaten PERIOD

Then I noticed as Ducks fans started acting all high and mighty to their Utah counterparts PERIOD Beating an undefeated team like the Utes would be an exhilarating feeling especially compared to wins against Idaho State PERIOD But dont get too comfortable Ducks you wont be having any more of those lucky wins PERIOD The Utes obviously werent at their best PERIOD
It was an unfortunate end to an amazing undefeated period but I still hold true to the fact that the Utes have an amazing season left in them PERIOD Yes Terrence Cain let down hopes that he was able but that doesnt mean the season is over PERIOD For the rest of it I will be out there on the field or in the stands with a beer in my hand watching and hoping to see the Utes show their true colors once again PERIOD And if they dont thats what the beer is for PERIOD
