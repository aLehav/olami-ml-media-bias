Seattle University once again employing a midfield diamond enjoyed success early on as Cameron Rohani Jeff Rose Alex Roldan and Sergio Rivas dictated the tempo in the middle of the park PERIOD Rivas a true freshman impressed yet again playing just behind Seattle Us two strikers and caused problems for the Huskies backline with his intelligent movement and quick play on the ball PERIOD

It took until the twenty-eighth minute for the Redhawks to break through UWs defense when Rose switched play to Roldan with a lovely driven pass PERIOD  Roldan then played into the feet of forward David Olsen whos expertly timed back heel was cushioned into the path of Rivas PERIOD Rivas made a burst directly at UWs center backs before slipping the ball back to Olsen who tucked away his finish exquisitely at the near post PERIOD

The massive crowd was quelled shortly afterward however as Nick Prasad brought down Washington fullback Justin Fiddes just inside the penalty area PERIOD Just minutes after the Redhawks took the lead Josh Heard struck his penalty kick in the bottom right corner to level the match PERIOD

Entering the halftime break after outplaying the Huskies yet sitting level with them on the scoreboard Fewing was confident that his teams play would outshine their opponent in the end PERIOD

Its a long season and youre going to have to play under pressure Fewing said PERIOD

And the pressure was soon lifted when Hamza Haddadis early second half goal propelled the Redhawks in front and proved to be the game winner PERIOD Haddadi whose goal was his seventh on the year equaling his tally for last term truly felt that the entire squad came together to get the result PERIOD

Its a big win for us I thought it was a whole team effort the forward noted PERIOD We thought we were the better team on the field today and I think it showed. after losing Roldan to injury mid way through the second half the pace of the game was still played to Seattle Us favor PERIOD Crosses kept coming into the box and Olsen and Haddadi proved to be a handful PERIOD The Redhawks outshot the Huskies  PERIOD

Fewing will now hope that this victory can give his players belief that they stand among the nations elite PERIOD

Thats not an easy team to play against in UW and if you can be successful against them you can be successful against most teams in the country Fewing said PERIOD
