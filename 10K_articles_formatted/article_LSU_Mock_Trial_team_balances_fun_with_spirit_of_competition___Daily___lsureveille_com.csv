The University affiliate of the American Mock Trial Association returned to Baton Rouge after a busy weekend in Jackson Mississippi PERIOD The clubs focus is a delicate blend of attempting to win each case it receives while enjoying time spent in the mock courtroom PERIOD One of the younger clubs on campus LSU Mock Trial was founded in the spring of  by several students who had experience with mock trials in high school PERIOD It competed in its first tournament the following spring PERIOD The competitions are sponsored by the American Mock Trial Association an organization that presides over all collegiate mock trial teams in the country PERIOD

The club generally competes in one tournament every spring PERIOD The number of club members varies each year and if the number is greater than usual the club will sometimes split into two teams for the tournament PERIOD For every tournament the AMTA will assign a case several months in advance of the tournament PERIOD The teams defend both sides at the tournament and judges grade each team member individually and give feedback PERIOD

One interesting quirk of the mock trials is that not every club member acts as an attorney or prosecutor PERIOD Club members must also be witnesses making some trials almost like a play PERIOD There is an acting element that most people who have never seen a mock trial do not understand PERIOD Club president Savanah Dickinson said this is what sets the club apart from simply debating facts PERIOD

People think were a debate team PERIOD They dont understand the acting aspect because its supposed to be entertaining Dickinson said PERIOD What you see on TV its like that but in a much more detailed complicated fashion PERIOD Youre pretending to be an attorney so you dress like an attorney and act like an attorney. the acting aspect makes the club more compelling and fun for a lot of the members PERIOD Political science junior Jacob McCon said the club provides a unique way to learn more about law procedures while making friends in the process PERIOD

I really enjoy the mock trial club we have here at LSU McCon said PERIOD Its a very fun and challenging environment where future attorneys  or anyone really  can learn a lot about courtroom advocacy and make great friends. in the most recent tournament at Mississippi College the club competed against the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama PERIOD Of the  clubs that competed eight of them advanced to the next round PERIOD The school hosting the tournament picks judges to preside over each case PERIOD These judges may be professors former mock trial members and are sometimes actual judges PERIOD

The mock trial greatly resembles an actual court of law but the cases are condensed to three hours PERIOD All rules and procedures are the same as in a legal court of law and club members are expected to treat the judges and opposition with respect as if they were participating in a real trial PERIOD

The tournament in Jackson means the club is wrapping up for the school year PERIOD Now it will begin recruiting for next semester when it will receive its next case from the AMTA PERIOD The club will review court proceedings discuss the case assign roles and begin working to win another case PERIOD
