Creating a stir not only in academic circles Harvard President Lawrence Summers comments regarding the paucity of women in math and science fields brought national attention to a problem that has been brewing for decades PERIOD

In his address to the National Bureau of Economic Research last week Summers suggested innate differences might make women less capable than men of succeeding at math and science PERIOD He went on to say that women might be less inclined to advance to top levels in science because they are unwilling to work long grueling hours once they have children PERIOD

Summers statements spawned an outrage among many of the nations top female scientists  including Denice Denton dean of the Universitys college of Engineering  and rightly so PERIOD Throughout the nation and right here at the UW hundreds of female scientists work arduously every day to prove Summers postulations false PERIOD

While the Harvard president did eventually apologize his comments prove deleterious to the efforts of these women they simultaneously create discussion and raise national consciousness to a fundamental problem underlying education  namely that women are often discouraged from pursuing careers in the sciences PERIOD

In a Jan PERIOD  Seattle Times article Denton noted that 

By suggesting that women are innately less capable in terms of ability in math and science individuals like Summers are reinforcing a selffulfilling educational paradigm PERIOD Universities throughout the country must amend this paradigm by creating scholarships which encourage women to pursue careers in math and science while fostering a burgeoning curiosity instead of suppressing it PERIOD
