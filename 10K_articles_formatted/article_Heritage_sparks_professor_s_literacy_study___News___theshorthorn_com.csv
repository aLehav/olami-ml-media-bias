Young children who write letters to extended family members improve their literacy skills as determined in a study by Kathryn Pole assistant professor in the College of Educations Department of Curriculum and Instruction PERIOD

Its really common for kindergartens to do journals Pole said PERIOD I had a feeling that if they had someone who they thought was really reading their stuff and cared that they would write more. the study called Why Downt You Riyt Back to Me originated from Poles desire to preserve family history PERIOD Pole followed  kindergarten students at a public school in the southwestern U.S PERIOD for one year PERIOD

This study showcases the ways that very young children who are just becoming literate can participate in written dialogue with family members said Peggy Semingson associate professor in Curriculum and Instruction PERIOD This is sometimes overlooked in classrooms in the early years as some might not think that parents can also be included or that children can write much at this age. the kindergarten students and the family members they wrote to lived far enough apart that they didnt visit often PERIOD The students wrote letters that were  to  words in length Pole said PERIOD

Kindergarteners who wrote letters to family learned to spell better structure and plan out their writing more effectively PERIOD

After her mother passed away Pole said she realized her whole family history was gone PERIOD Pole said she wanted the families in her study to have connections with their children PERIOD

The family members were writing to the kids Pole said PERIOD They were telling these family stories and the kids would start connecting and writing back PERIOD They were just conversing in this family history. at the end of the project the correspondences continued and created a bond between the children and their family members independent of the study Pole said PERIOD

John Smith associate dean for Educator Preparation said he has taught firstgrade students and relates to Poles research PERIOD The kindergarten students participating in the study wrote and progressed at their own rates he said PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Poles research just affirmed what Ive seen and believed to be true Smith said PERIOD Her school principal gave her the freedom to teach the way she felt these kids needed to be taught PERIOD She was able to tailor that to the needs of each student. pole said she plans to replicate the study in different classrooms with various demographics PERIOD

The best part of it was the family stories Pole said PERIOD
