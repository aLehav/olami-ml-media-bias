The books are bought PERIOD Theres already an unidentified stain on the carpet PERIOD And the roommate is either the good the bad or the ugly PERIOD

Congratulations PERIOD You lived to see week two PERIOD Its time to bid adieu to welcome week parties and greet the upcoming semester PERIOD

This is college a time of extreme activity intellectual or not and sooner or later the daily grind of life as a college student will catch up to even the most motivated spirited young adult PERIOD Suddenly the initiative to participate in the world beyond your comfort zone will diminish if not disappear altogether PERIOD

I know all about midsemester or midcollege lulls when the thought of pursuing  ambitious goals of weekly yoga and staying caught up on reading fly not only out the window but out into the polluted sky PERIOD Enterprise becomes as elusive as the receding polar ice caps PERIOD

So whether youre a first week freshman or a drifter somewhere between sophomore year and graduation now is the time to reflect on what you want to accomplish this year Please keep in mind that theres more to college than beer pong and smoking pot PERIOD

I challenge you to do the following

 PERIOD Try something new PERIOD Sample an ethnic food PERIOD Boston streets boast eateries serving up Brazilian Ethiopian and Turkish flavors not to mention bold variety in between PERIOD Experience unfamiliar cultures by seeking out exotic conveniently located restaurants PERIOD At the very least try a different Frappuccino flavor at Starbucks PERIOD

 PERIOD Get involved PERIOD Not just on campus but in your life PERIOD If youre an Internet junkie log off Facebook get up go outside and find two new things you like to do PERIOD Repeat as needed PERIOD Join a club host a soiree go people watching PERIOD  Refuse to be passive  on that note PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD

 PERIOD Write a letter to the editor PERIOD Youth is about expressing ideas starting dialogue or publicly  albeit tactfully  announcing that upstairs neighbors should refrain from honing Dance Dance Revolution skills in the wee hours PERIOD

 PERIOD Explore your beliefs PERIOD Debate with a Republican Democrat or other and open your mind to differing opinions while giving a voice to your own PERIOD If religion is a priority read about other religions like the ancient yet widely forgotten Zoroastrianism PERIOD

This is not a lecture PERIOD It is a reminder to maintain the initial semester zeal staving off the frustration of daily routine by remembering that college adventures go beyond house parties with kegs PERIOD

If youre new to university life you will soon develop habits and routines to get the homework and laundry done while allowing time to party PERIOD But arent you here to engage in more than the basic routine of life If thats all you want then get a job PERIOD

Remember youre here to get an education that includes more than coursework and knowing the best way to write a paper while hungover PERIOD

Im in this challenge too PERIOD

My something new is this column PERIOD Ive flirted with the idea of writing one for a few semesters and theres no time like the present PERIOD
