Sirens screech loudly the pitch getting higher and higher PERIOD Flashing Friday night lights cast a red and blue shadow in the midnight air PERIOD The Villanova Emergency Medical Services VEMS ambulance turns the corner rushing in to South campus PERIOD As a group of people gravitate toward the vehicle the whispers of the onlookers are heard Someone is getting VEMed

Quickly the team exits the ambulance and disappears inside a dorm PERIOD Of  calls a year only about  percent or  calls are alcoholrelated PERIOD But when these calls do come the majority of them occur on the weekends PERIOD Friday night PERIOD Party night PERIOD

Weve all imagined what happened before the medics arrived on the scene PERIOD Three drinks escalated to  and the dance floor turned into the bathroom floor PERIOD The pungent smell of beer rum chased with soda and vodka mixed with cranberry juice escaped from subjects mouth as he or she spoke PERIOD Halfglazed eyes wandered back and forth between the different volunteers as they evaluate the situation PERIOD Public Safety loomed in the background as students prepared for the inevitable speech on underage drinking PERIOD

Because of rumors and speculation VEMS may be the enemy to you PERIOD After all once they whisk you away in that shiny white ambulance your friends take license to mock you for the rest of the semester PERIOD

Little does the student body know however that the VEMS team is here to help rather than hurt PERIOD They take control of the situation making sure that you are in a conscious alert and oriented state before they identify the primary issue PERIOD Keeping your health stable is their concern not getting you in trouble PERIOD Public Safety is responsible for filing a report based on the information gathered and Residence Life takes it from there PERIOD

Those bright lights and piercing sirens may still excite you when youre sober PERIOD They may always scare you when youve had a drink too many PERIOD But the VEMS team should be thought of as even less intimidating than Kathy the Omelet lady PERIOD
