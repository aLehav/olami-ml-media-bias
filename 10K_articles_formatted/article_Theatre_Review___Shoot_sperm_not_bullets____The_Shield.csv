As I sat in the front row at Tuesday nights advanced preview of Lysistrata I was taken aback when the character Kinesias placed his penis on my leg mid show PERIOD

I truly got the full extent of the experience PERIOD

The scandalous play portraysfemale empowerment as the women of Greece switched from fleshy fun to plastic pleasure in protest of the Peloponnesian War PERIOD

Wassermans adaptation of the Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes takes the term double entendre to a new level PERIOD

He mixes a classical setting with modern amenities like popcorn machines and makes use of cartoonish sound effects mimetic of those in IFCs Portlandia. shawnte Gaston commands the stage as the powerful Lysistrata who is known as the town pump until she rallies the lustful ladies in a sexual strike in which they refuse to fulfill their mens carnal fantasies PERIOD

They don their acropolis haven with bannersa la 60s Vietnam proteststhat revealed phrases like Shoot sperm not bullets. the time period fusion includedinterludes featuring 80s female pop anthems PERIOD

Each female character represented misogynistic stereotypes like the dumb blonde and the desperate slutwith revealing outfits to match PERIOD

Although all the ladies were on point there are too many characters to discuss all of their strengths and weaknesses but one womans performance stood out PERIOD

Enjoli Drake played Spartan woman Libido a dominatrix type whose perfectly misplaced Russian accent was spot on PERIOD Although her stage time was limited Drake whipped her bodacious role into shape PERIOD

The elderly men in their  Grandpa hats and Hawaiian shirts left behind during the war grumpily try to persuade the women to give in PERIOD

USI Theatres costumedesignerStephanie Sauerheber and custume shophad the odd task of constructing the wrinkled schlongs that dangled between the mens knobby knees through the entirety of their performancesthat is when they werent twirling them around like propellers PERIOD

To deter the men the women barricade the acropolis with a crotchety collection of cantankerous old crazies made up of Old Vulva Danielle Scott Vericosia Brandis DeWilligen Purdenda Chynna Hall Urethra Adrian Small and Chlamydia Megan Hoffman PERIOD

The five cackling ladies were riotous as they wobbled about the stage taunting their oppressors with sharp quips and fending them off with water guns PERIOD

As the story progresses batteries to their vibrators die out and many of the ladies succumb to desire and try to escape the stronghold PERIOD

When young handsome characters like Tesitcoles Samuel Baker and Kinesias Luke Bockelman enter then ladies struggle increases PERIOD



Raging with testosterone the mens members rise to varying degrees of erectionprops to the prop teamas they plead with the women PERIOD

Some characters even turn to homoerotic outlets for relief PERIOD

Wassermans play was chaotically fantastic and showered the audience with frantic scenes that have me wanting to go again to see what gems I missed PERIOD

Although the perverse scrambled nature of Lysistrata was overwhelming at times the cast wonderfully displays feminine strength and truly permeates the message that Hell hath no fury like a woman horny PERIOD
