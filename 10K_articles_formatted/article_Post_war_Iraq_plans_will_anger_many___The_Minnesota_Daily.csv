Although the George W PERIOD Bush administration has not yet officially decided whether to invade Iraq it has recently released tentative plans for the occupation of a postwar Iraq and the transition to a democraticallyelected civilian government as if the war not yet begun was actually won PERIOD Not only are such plans entirely preliminary although certainly a necessary part of strategizing they also illustrate the fundamental misunderstanding the Bush administration has about war with Iraq and the war on terror PERIOD

Instead of immediately establishing a government comprised solely of Iraqis similar to Hamid Karzais government in Afghanistan the Bush administration plans to affect a more gradual transition to democratic civilian rule PERIOD In Afghanistan the administration contends the military was too eager to establish a postTaliban government and the result is the instability that exists today as attacks continue against Karzai and members of the government and internecine fighting continues PERIOD Iraq is similarly fragmented although Saddam Hussein does enjoy support from many of the various tribal groups as he has always maintained financial support for them PERIOD

Rather than an Iraqi government the Bush administration is planning to install a transitional U.S PERIOD military government perhaps for several years PERIOD Instead of being led by an Iraqi dissident with a similar background to Karzais Iraq would initially be led by an American military commander possibly Gen PERIOD Tommy R PERIOD Franks who is the current head of Central Command PERIOD During this initial period there would only be limited responsibility for any Iraqi opposition groups although there is the possibility that a consultative council would be established PERIOD Such a council would presumably be comprised of both foreign and domestic dissidents although they are unlikely to be elected PERIOD Ultimately the military regime would dissolve and be replaced by a democraticallyelected government PERIOD However the Bush administration stated that only when a stable civilian government had been established would the U.S PERIOD military presence slowly disappear PERIOD

There is some strategic value to establishing an U.S PERIOD military government in Iraq although some of it is of dubious value PERIOD This type of military presence would afford the United States a generous period of time with which to locate any components of Husseins chemical and biological weapons programs as well as any possible nuclear weapons ordinance PERIOD The United States would also be able to establish a military tribunal to try Iraqi government officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity which seems to be appealing not because the Bush administration is aggressively pursuing justice around the world but because such a tribunal would be disincentive for Iraqis to use weapons of mass destruction against U.S PERIOD forces PERIOD Also it would be much easier for the United States to ensure that the government remains proAmerican many years after the U.S PERIOD military has left the country as the Iraqi military would be significantly reduced in size and any remaining officials of Husseins Baath Party would be identified and removed from office PERIOD

The administrations newly developed plan is of course more deliberate and careful than the transition plan for Afghanistan although more importantly it would be less palatable to Islamic communities in the region PERIOD Many fundamentalists as well as more moderate residents of the Middle East are already suspicious of the United States intentions for a war with Iraq PERIOD If the U.S PERIOD military assumed control over Iraq and its oil fields  which are the second largest in the world and responsible for  percent of total world output  anger would erupt over what would be perceived as the United States true intentions to totally dominate the control of oil in the Middle East PERIOD Unfortunately such a perspective would be both common and catastrophic for the United States and would likely inflame regional hatred of Americans PERIOD

Of course the United States has attempted this postwar strategy before most notably in Japan which was under the control of Gen PERIOD Douglas MacAuthur for six and a half years and Germany which the military operated for four years PERIOD The current circumstances though are entirely different as the opposition is not welldefined governments but individual international terrorist groups that just as accurately reflect the societies that produce them PERIOD With a deliberate more convenient approach to occupying Iraq many of these groups would have already begun to respond to what they would perceive as U.S PERIOD aggression and colonialism PERIOD
