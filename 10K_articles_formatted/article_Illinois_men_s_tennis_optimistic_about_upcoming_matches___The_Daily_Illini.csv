Illinois mens tennis coach Brad Dancer has a simple philosophy when determining who to schedule for opponents PERIOD

We play the best all the time no matter what Dancer said PERIOD It gives the guys opportunities and allows them to rise to the occasion. illinois will host the University of Alabama the University of Notre Dame and the University of Miami in Olympia Fields Ill. at the Olympia Fields Country Club clay courts from Sept PERIOD  PERIOD The Illini the Fighting Irish the Crimson Tide and the Hurricanes finished No PERIOD  No PERIOD  No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  respectively in the Intercollegiate Tennis Associations final  poll PERIOD

The Fighting Illini Intercollegiate Invitational is the only Division I contest that uses clay courts PERIOD The Invitational will be a round robin format for singles and doubles PERIOD Dancer said that each participant will compete in about four singles and three doubles matches PERIOD

Im pretty excited to get out there and show the opponents what were made of said Ryan Rowe a  singles and doubles AllAmerican PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Because of the quality of the opponents Rowe sees that there is an opportunity to acquire ranked victories PERIOD Those ultimately will help the rankings going into the spring season PERIOD

Additionally Rowe likes the idea of competing in challenging matches to boost up his own skill level PERIOD

Junior Marc Spicijaric agrees with Rowe and personally believes that the challenges right off the bat can let a team know exactly where it is PERIOD

The difficult matches are great for us Spicijaric said PERIOD Hard matches are tough to come by especially early on in the season  PERIOD If we do not do well then well know that we need to pick up our level of training and our level of commitment. the 5foot10 Spicijaric who tied for the most wins on last years team with former teammate Kevin Anderson at  singles victories wanted to take advantage of the loaded invitational PERIOD

But he cannot PERIOD

Spicijaric said he suffered a groin injury about a week ago PERIOD He will still travel with the team and hopes to start practicing later in the weekend PERIOD Dancer noted that he wants Spicijaric to have a doctor look at the injury again and then to just go from there. the thing thats disappointing for Spicijaric is clay is one of his strongest surfaces Dancer said PERIOD Hes really really good on clay. dancer believes that Spicijaric could have gone  in the singles competitions against highly accomplished opponents PERIOD His future ranking would have potentially risen drastically and hed be more recognized PERIOD

Its the only tournament played on clay Dancer said PERIOD From an opportunity standpoint its a big loss  PERIOD for him PERIOD But that happens. amid a clear blue sky on Tuesday Spicijaric looked on as other tennis teammates participated in an unofficial team workout at the clay courts in preparation for the weekends invitational PERIOD Rowe was volleying with a teammate using his left hand on the second court PERIOD

Just before Rowe was with the rest of the team listening to Dancer describe exactly what he expects for the invitational PERIOD Dancer emphasized that in doubles the server should feel like he is in control of the game PERIOD He also wants his players to isolate opponents weaknesses PERIOD

Finally Dancer told his players whether theyre winning  or seem to be in an impossible situation they should always stay in the moment. after Dancers speech Rowe wearing an orange hat and his Nike socks pulled up to his shins went to the second court PERIOD This is when teammates compete against each other PERIOD

Rowe believes that the early competitive invitational is going to be good for his teammates especially the freshmen PERIOD

The freshmen can use the experience to get a feel for what playing will be like Rowe said PERIOD They can use the experience to get a feel for what things will be like. the freshmen and the Illini team in general will have their hands full as the invitational boasts seven players ranked in the top  in the ITA preseason tennis poll PERIOD Rowe is a friend of Notre Dames Sheeva Parbhu who is ranked No PERIOD  PERIOD Also Alabama has No PERIOD  Billy Mertz and the Hurricanes have No PERIOD  AllAmerican Dani Vallverdu PERIOD

Rowe and Spicijaric say other leaders for the Illini have been stepping up like seniors Brandon Davis and Ruben Gonzales PERIOD

The senior who is expected to do the most based on preseason rankings is Rowe PERIOD He has a No PERIOD  national ranking PERIOD But Rowe does not want to let preseason rankings affect the way he thinks or plays PERIOD He intends to use such a strategy this weekend PERIOD

What I really find out is preseason rankings dont mean much Rowe said PERIOD You go out there and anybody can beat anybody PERIOD I just try to get better and play the guy that is across the net from me.",Illinois men's tennis optimistic about upcoming matches - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
