Ellensburg will soon become home to The Botany Shop a new plant and botanical goods store opening downtown PERIOD Owner April Rohrbach has been working on opening her shop for about two years and said she is excited to share her love for plants with locals PERIOD

We will specialize in all sorts of plants Rohrbach said PERIOD Just a really wide variety of high quality houseplants for sale PERIOD Everything like cacti succulents tropical foliage indoor trees and well also be including some plant care items and botanical goods as well. rohrbach originally went to school for art and photography but later discovered her passion for plants and wanting to open a store PERIOD

Thats kind of where it started it was just a dream of mine like oh that would be so cool to own a plant store Rohrbach said PERIOD Ive been just obsessed with houseplants for years before it was cool. junior music performance major Lexi Harkrider says she is looking forward to having a new plant store so close to home PERIOD

A friend of mine sent me the instagram to show me we were getting a plant store Harkrider said  PERIOD Im really excited about the idea of a houseplant shop PERIOD There are some other shops that primarily sell outdoor plants so itll be nice to have one that specializes in indoor plants. harkrider also said having plants around the house has helped her keep her house lively since shes been spending so much time there over the last year PERIOD

I really like nature and house plants because I can keep them inside PERIOD I get gratification from taking care of something and watching it grow Harkrider said PERIOD Its great to be surrounded by living things when not many people can be around. rohrbach said this is her first time running a business and has learned everything on her own and through the help of a business advisor PERIOD

Probably about six months ago I started seeing a business advisor through the Kittitas County Chamber of Commerce she said PERIOD That was actually a free service that they provided they help you figure out all the steps so thats been a really big part of the learning curve and they have free classes so thats been the main part of my learning about business. she said while she knew it would be a lot of work shes been surprised by just how many steps there are to opening a store PERIOD Rohrbach said her family and boyfriend have been big supporters and have helped along the way and shes excited for all of it PERIOD

I think Im mostly excited about just bringing plants to everyone here who are plant crazy like myself Rohrbach said PERIOD And hopefully seeing how happy it makes everyone here and spreading the joy and seeing all the excitement. the Botany Shop is tentatively set to open at the end of May and will be located at  West third Avenue just off of Main Street PERIOD You can follow updates on Instagram thebotanyshop or on Facebook thebotanyshopellensburg
