Born out of a powerful convergence of social consciousness and a widespread availability of mindaltering drugs psychedelia burst out of the 1960s like the beads of a shattered kaleidoscope PERIOD It was a movement characterized by tiedye and fringed vests worn by hippies who danced to the likes of Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead at places like Woodstock and Ken Keseys notorious Acid Tests in San Francisco PERIOD The substances that defined the culturemescaline peyote hallucinogenic mushrooms and most infamously lysergic acid diethylamide or LSDwere embraced by youths who found themselves seeking heightened states of consciousness while tuning in and dropping out across the nation PERIOD The psychedelic art of the culture comprised of freeflowing forms vibrant colors and hyperdetailed mosaics helped shape and will forever identify the times vibrant counterculture PERIOD

Fastforward  years The bellbottoms and love beads of yesteryear have been replaced by skinny jeans and ear buds PERIOD Gone are the days of velvet trousers and flower power and as all such things must evolve a new generation of artists has emerged producing intense imagery similar to that of the 1960s though not quite for the same reasons PERIOD

This modern genre known as dense videography has been dubbed psychedelic because of its use of deep color layering flashing lights and stratified visual media PERIOD But rather than trying to convey the far out experience of hallucinogenic drugs contemporary artists create these multidimensional videos using digitalized shapes and mediasourced imagery that embodies the present technological age PERIOD Inspired by an unprecedented flow of nonstop information these artists aim to offer an engaging alternative to the monotonous narrative of mainstream media PERIOD

Part of the intent of the videos is to purposely put more in there than you can get out of it in a passive way PERIOD Were already bombarded with so much information and everything is created to be so passive PERIOD It was kind of a reaction to our current environment says Portlandbased multimedia artist Eric Mast who is professionally known by the name ERock PERIOD

Palace of Light Revisited a collaboration between Mast who recorded the videos soundtrack under his record label Audio Dregs and New Yorkbased multimedia artist Yoshi Sodeoka begins as an assault of layered colors and flashing light that smears across a computer screen to a staggered electronic drum beat PERIOD The intermittent bass takes a back seat to tunnellike effects that originate from a distant vanishing point in the center of the screen PERIOD A confetti of white lights erupts as the seconds tick by muted red faces begin to wash in and out of view as laser patterns play against a starry backdrop PERIOD The visual layers get deeper and deeper and as random imagery flashes onandoff screen complex scenes emerge with information so densely put together that the video requires repeated viewing to process everything PERIOD

My stuff is for your senses PERIOD If you see one of my videos and you get stressed out thats one thing PERIOD But if you see a video and it makes you excited thats good too explains Sodeoka who has been creating videos for over  years PERIOD

Other artists like Christian Oldham known professionally as Megazord are taking the dense video art form to another level entirely PERIOD Psychedelic is often associated with the artwork of the 1960s and 1970s which was often inspired by LSD acid trips Oldham says PERIOD Ive never done drugs PERIOD I dont know if my videos look like an acid trip PERIOD Im trying to express something more along the lines of a technological lifestyle. in early  Oldham debuted his realtime Internetbased performance piece Burning Down Your Facebook to a crowd of about  in the basement of Portland concert hall the Artistry PERIOD Dressed in headtotoe black a style he best describes as cyberpunk Oldham sat with his back to the audience PERIOD IDM intelligent dance music saturated the lowerlevel floor as he used the large wall screen as a canvas upon which to deliver a rapidfire assault of technological overload PERIOD

I was showing Mark Rothko paintings next to photographs of war crimes with iChat right under that and then a YouTube video of a Hummer going offroad all at once Oldham says PERIOD Within the one screen there would be about six different things going on. he explains that despite the overwhelming effect of the initial layers which overlapped each other in quick succession the levels actually went much deeper PERIOD By opening and closing programs Oldham had realtime video chats with audience members while looping videos flashed in and out of view at high speeds throughout the performance PERIOD

Adam Forkner who was in the audience live video chatting with Oldham says that the show stirred mixed feelings in the audience as some members were uncomfortable with the intensity of the shows intimacy PERIOD Such reactions Forkner says reflect how he believes people privately engage on the Internet by scavenging around and overwhelming themselves with random informationa timewasting behavior they may not want to discuss publicly PERIOD It was a good mirror cast to what goes unsaid about how people spend their time on the Internet he adds PERIOD

Even while each artist manipulates electronic media to express his or her own stylistic nuances there is no denying that the psychedelic genre utilizes the ubiquitous nature of modern technology not only as a delivery method but as a source of inspiration PERIOD An array of influences from characters inspired by the original Nintendo Entertainment System to clips of kabuki dancers in Japanese makeup advertisements can all be found streaming through dense media layers PERIOD Music of all kindselectronic punk and even metalalso plays a powerful role since many artists often design their videos to complement music they have already created PERIOD

It just makes sense to do everything at once PERIOD If I made a painting I wouldnt let other people touch it says Sodeoka who creates dense videos as a compliment to his selfproduced albums PERIOD

Regardless of its source every layer created by a dense video artist is designed to stimulate the audience although the narrative may not always be instantly understandable PERIOD But like bringing any new art form to fruition its all about pushing boundaries PERIOD In the 1990s when Mast began experimenting with videos files had to be the smallest size possible in order to maximize the amount of content jampacked into one video PERIOD The limited technology and dialup Internet of the time restricted the density of layers and would often cause Masts computer system to crash PERIOD

Part of the exercise was based on how much you could make with how little you had Mast recalls PERIOD Now he says technology is so advanced that it is harder to push those limits but it also means that the possibilities are infinite PERIOD
