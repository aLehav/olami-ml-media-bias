4137,2013-04-18,"put the gun down ZZ Wards voice commands in a soulful manner as she sways along to her song PERIOD Soulful sultry and brazen ZZ Ward brought the cool element to her unique mixture of blues pop and folk to her show at SOhO last February PERIOD

Raised in Oregon Ward has blues in her blood with her inspiration stemming from listening to old rock blues and pop vinyl records as well as her fathers musical influences PERIOD Wards voice could be explained as the love child of Adele and Amy Winehouse except that it also has a sound that is distinctly her own PERIOD Ward started her recent set with numbers like Home and Till the Casket Drops each offering pleasantly different harmonies and melodies PERIOD None of Wards music is repetitive each song inspires a feeling that is totally different from the previous song PERIOD

While songs like Home are sentimental and poetic songs like Put the Gun Down and Blue Eyes Blind give a kick of female power PERIOD Maybe thats what makes ZZ Ward so cool she embodies empowerment and isnt scared to sing what she thinks  something I totally respect in an artist PERIOD

Forget sappy teen washout singers that are more show and glitter than substance ZZ is all substance with a fiery flare that attracts all kinds of audiences PERIOD It is obvious that the band she plays with is in love with her as well PERIOD Not only were they having fun performing but there was something intuitive between all of them PERIOD

You can feel those blues hit you when Erick Walls the touring guitarist goes off into a riff that transcends time PERIOD Its a sound that will get you closer to God PERIOD

Good music does this PERIOD ZZ Wards soulful and sincere voice along with the band is like melted butter on pancakes PERIOD Not only is ZZ Wards music distinctively hers but her aura is also quite something with her dusky speaking voice and a signature hat with a feather emphasizing her larger than life eyes PERIOD ZZ Ward is too much her own woman to be put in the same category as a bunch of other young female singers PERIOD Sure her music is about a boy who broke her heart but are they songs about her pining for his love Hell no PERIOD Instead theyre retaliation in the best way hearty melodies and sexy rhythms that would make any guy come running PERIOD

Its rare that so much talent can be found in someone so young her lyrics are poetic yet bold and her fuckoff attitude matches the album perfectly PERIOD Ward has a kind of demanding presence PERIOD Her album Put the Gun Down is just the start of something pretty amazing PERIOD This girls got it PERIOD
