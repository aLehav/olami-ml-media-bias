Introduction

Denai Moores third full length album Modern Dread was released Friday July   PERIOD The BritishJamaican singer has been making music since  thats quintessentially indie in the sense that it does not seem to conform to a particular genre PERIOD Her inspirations range from Lauryn Hill to Bon Iver and this intricate twist of sounds can be heard in her music PERIOD This album explores themes of introspection breakups and how one fits in with the rest of the world as the future seems to be dreadful. if you were a fan of the Moses Sumney album Spinnaker reviewed a couple weeks ago youll enjoy Denai Moore PERIOD



Trackbytrack Review

Summary

I have NPRs New Music Friday to thank for introducing me to Denai Moore PERIOD After listening to this album all the way through multiple times I can say without a doubt that I thoroughly enjoy Moores work PERIOD Theres something soothing about her voice amidst the varying instrumentals PERIOD She can make any song work from soul to folk and electronic to indie RB PERIOD She brings a unique sound to the table and although she has been making music for quite some time people should still keep an eye out for her rise PERIOD The sound was experimental and the lyrics relatable and held a certain gravity to them PERIOD I would give this album  Spinnaker Sails PERIOD
