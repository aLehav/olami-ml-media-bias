Nebraskas Dedrick Mills  attempts to run with the ball while being tackled by opponents during the game against Wisconsin at Memorial Stadium on Saturday Nov PERIOD   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

Nebraska suffered a painful  loss to No PERIOD  Wisconsin on Saturday in Lincoln PERIOD After a promising start where the Huskers led  in the second quarter it was all Badgers as they scored  unanswered points PERIOD

Here are position grades for todays game

Quarterbacks B

Sophomore quarterback Adrian Martinez had a solid allaround day although he had a few mistakes that cost the team and prevents his grade from being higher PERIOD

Martinez went  for  yards and a touchdown with an interception PERIOD He ran for  yards and a touchdown on  carries as well including a 45yard run when the Huskers were pinned at their own 5yard line PERIOD Those numbers arent eyepopping by any means but it was an improvement over recent weeks PERIOD

What that box score doesnt show was the importance of the interception and a sack that lost  yards PERIOD The interception came right after Wisconsin took a  lead and the Huskers needed a response PERIOD Instead the ball was batted at the line and picked off PERIOD Wisconsin scored a touchdown three plays later and maintained that cushion the rest of the game PERIOD

The sack was worse as it came when the Huskers were driving deep in Wisconsin territory PERIOD Because it lost  yards the Huskers were knocked out of field goal range and lost all momentum they had gained PERIOD Nebraska gained the  yards back in the next two plays but missed the 41yard field goal PERIOD

Running backs A

With freshman star WanDale Robinson out with an injury it was time for junior running back Dedrick Mills to shine and shine he did PERIOD Mills ran for a careerhigh  yards on  carries and a touchdown PERIOD Its more impressive considering it came against a Wisconsin rush defense that had only allowed one other 100yard rusher all season PERIOD

If Robinson misses more time Mills will need more performances like this PERIOD The only depth behind him is senior Wyatt Mazour who had three rushes for no yards and three receptions for  yards PERIOD Freshman Rahmir Johnson only has one game of eligibility left if he wants to hold onto his redshirt so it is unlikely he can help out much either PERIOD

Wide ReceiversTight Ends B

It was a pretty hohum day for Nebraskas passcatchers as they were not asked to do much PERIOD Senior wide receiver Kanawai Noa led the group with three receptions for  yards and had one of his better performances in a Husker uniform PERIOD His 36yard reception late in the fourth quarter gave the Huskers some late hope at a comeback but it wasnt enough PERIOD

Junior wideout JD Spielman had another solid day with four receptions for  yards and a touchdown PERIOD His 23yard touchdown reception in the third quarter displayed his excellent routerunning as he dropped a Wisconsin defender on a nifty move for the score PERIOD

The tight ends combined for three receptions for  yards PERIOD

Offensive Line B

Saturday was the offensive lines best performance of the year and it came against one of their toughest tests PERIOD Wisconsins defensive front is intimidating and is a big reason for the teams success but was not as troublesome as expected particularly against the run PERIOD Mills had a great game but it wasnt without the help of his offensive line which constantly created running lanes for him PERIOD

The only reason this grade is lower is because of spotty pass blocking PERIOD Martinez was sacked four times on the day including on backtoback plays on the first possession of the day PERIOD Either way this was a positive performance for this group and something to build on PERIOD

Defensive Line C

All things considered the defensive line played better than expected PERIOD With seniors Darrion Daniels and Carlos Davis both out with injuries young players were asked to step up PERIOD Ty Robinson Keem Green and Casey Rogers all received playing time and performed admirably PERIOD

At the end of the day though the Huskers registered no sacks and allowed Badger running back Jonathan Taylor to run for  yards PERIOD Neither are great but head coach Scott Frost can live with it when the circumstances are considered PERIOD

Linebackers D

While part of the blame for Taylors  yards can be placed on the defensive line the linebackers are just as guilty PERIOD Taylor broke numerous arm tackles and frequently caused trouble for the run defense PERIOD Again most of this was to be expected as the Huskers run defense is among the worst in the Big Ten but it is another reminder of the need for an influx of talent at linebacker PERIOD

Senior Mohamed Barry and junior Will Honas led the team with  tackles each PERIOD

Secondary C

With the Badgers success on the ground the secondary was not tested much although they struggled with tackling as much as the rest of the defense did PERIOD In the second quarter Badger quarterback Jack Coan completed a short slant across the middle but three missed tackles by members of the secondary made a short completion turn into a 55yard catchandrun PERIOD

The secondary did have a solid sequence at the end of the first half when the Badgers were trying to score a touchdown in the final seconds PERIOD This was a theme for much of the day as the Badgers never really tested the Husker corners PERIOD

Special Teams F

Theres really no positives to take away from the special teams performance today PERIOD First the Huskers allowed Wisconsins kick returner Aron Cruickshank to have the first kick return touchdown of his career PERIOD It came right after the Huskers went up  in the first quarter and halted any momentum gained to that point PERIOD

The kicking game was also shaky as Pickering missed his only field goal attempt of the day from  yards out PERIOD The snap was high which possibly caused the missed attempt but either way there are no excuses for mistakes like this to keep happening PERIOD
