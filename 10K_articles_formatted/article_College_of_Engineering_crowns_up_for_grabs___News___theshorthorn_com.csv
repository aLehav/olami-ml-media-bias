Engineering students have the chance to vote for who they want to represent their college as Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering through Friday PERIOD

Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering lets two engineering students be in leadership roles and be representatives for the College of Engineering said Abira Syed industrial engineering junior and Engineering Student Council president PERIOD Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering is a tradition that has lasted more than a decade at UTA she said PERIOD

Engineering students can vote from noon to  p.m PERIOD Monday through Friday in the Nedderman Hall atrium at a booth PERIOD Only engineering students can vote for these positions to make sure that Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering accurately represent the college Syed said PERIOD The positions are annual and are elected each spring PERIOD

Truly it would have a true and accurate vote because if the student is in engineering they would know more about the students interests Syed said PERIOD When they go to classes with them and they go to events with them and volunteer with them it gives a true voice PERIOD If youre outside of engineering such as liberal arts education music whatsoever its basically bringing votes from outside the engineering realm that wouldnt have an accurate view. ashutosh Banerjee material science engineering graduate student said he plans to vote next week for Mr PERIOD and Mrs PERIOD Engineering PERIOD

These positions are very important because its very good to have a representative among the students as he or she knows the different problems that the students face Banerjee said PERIOD

Students can campaign anywhere on campus and in Nedderman Hall but not near the voting booth Syed said PERIOD

Academics are important in engineering but so are soft skills such as communication which the position of Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering will give students Syed said PERIOD Mr PERIOD and Ms PERIOD Engineering have to represent the college at university events and banquets PERIOD They also decorate for and participate in the Homecoming parade PERIOD
