After the gargantuan success that was Battlefield  Dice and EA are back at it again with the newest iteration in the Battlefield franchise PERIOD Touting a new Frostbite3 engine some next gen power and expanded new dynamic multiplayer maps BF4 has its sights set at overtaking Call of Duty to reign as the  shooter on both consoles and PC PERIOD Does it succeed or fall into the murky waters of generic shooter territory Find out below PERIOD

Battlefield  Xb360XbonePS3PS4PC is a firstperson shooter set in the year  with the world tinkering on the brink of war as per canon in these games PERIOD After being blamed for an assassination attempt on a Chinese leader the US this time teamed up with Russia is set upon righting wrongs finding out the true perpetrators and preventing the start of another world war PERIOD It is absolutely clich to the max and is really really lackluster in that regard PERIOD There is nothing in the story mode that you will remember aside from punching dogs because you have seen it all before for many years in a row now PERIOD Same gray explosions same gray landscapes same cheesy oneliners over and over PERIOD However as much a fan as I am of the whole package of games story scenery and gameplay I cant help but feel that it would negatively affect my opinion of this game and do a disservice to those of you reading it PERIOD Battlefield was a multiplayer game first thriving on the PC well before its debut on consoles with Battlefield  PERIOD Single player was never a factor in the games and was only added on to ensure more sales PERIOD As such to those of you getting ready to skewer me I assure you that it wont factor so heavily on the review because there is a lot more here to love PERIOD

What I cherished about the Battlefield series was the multiplayer PERIOD Not for the general reason everyone else has ala team deathmatch and the like but because of the sheer dynamics of it PERIOD Similar to the COD series Battlefield allows you to customize your unit of choice with an array of weaponry and gear ranging from handguns rifles shotguns and grenades PERIOD The key difference here however is that each class despite the initial loadout changes up how you play each match PERIOD Once you choose your class Assault Support Recon and Engineer and your loadout you are thrust onto an enormous map and tasked with helping your squad using varied strategies based on the class you chose PERIOD Say you picked support for your initial class PERIOD Instead of running and gunning like your recon brethren you would be more tactical planting claymores and suppressing the enemy team with mortar fire to keep your squad mates from dying on the field PERIOD If you are not so good on with scoping out enemies you may want to try your hand with the assault class PERIOD Although equipped with a rifle and knife similar to the other classes this one specializes in helping teammates out by throwing down valuable health kits or granting second lives to fallen comrades with the use of their defibrillators PERIOD This was my personal favorite class in all the Battlefield series as I would spend countless hours healing my team and proving backup while they pressed in on the enemy PERIOD

As stated above these levels are massive on the scale of Halo 1s first few levels PERIOD In fact they are so big that most maps have some sort of vehicle scattered about to allow for fast traversal of the map PERIOD And herein lies BF4s strongest feature its diversity PERIOD At the start of a match you may find yourself swimming to a boat to take over an enemy stronghold by sea while your squad mates take some jets and try to bomb the enemy by air and your support group sits on the tanks in the back lobbing mortar fire PERIOD Suppose the enemy has then shifted into a building and fortified it so that you cannot get inside to take over the location or plant a bomb PERIOD Instead of running and getting shot you can simply tell your team to shoot the support beams of the building and watch as the entire map fills with smoke and debris from the ensuing demolition PERIOD After the enemy team has now been pancaked you can run to the rubble and take over the newly opened territory PERIOD Matches can change just that quickly whether by capture points falling apart dams crumbling to change portions of the map into makeshift rivers and so on leaving you with plenty to do well after you have finished the single player experience PERIOD

Bottom Line This game is a blast and doubly so on the PC and next gen consoles PERIOD While it is just as good a game on the PS3X360 the matches scale from  player combat on current gen systems to  player action on the next gens and PCs PERIOD While the maps themselves are still the same it is a lot less barren and therefore more enjoyable PERIOD Despite that and the obvious graphical improvement it is largely the same game across all platforms PERIOD When it comes down to it though I enjoyed this game because unlike too many other shooters it requires me to think about my actions PERIOD Respawns are not instant so I do not run around like I am invincible PERIOD On top of that cover is destructible so I must make sure I am ready to move whenever shells start flying PERIOD If you are a fan of FPS games and are willing to fork out  for a superb multiplayer experience and a meh single player one I highly recommend you pick this up now or as one of your launch titles for the next gen consoles PERIOD
