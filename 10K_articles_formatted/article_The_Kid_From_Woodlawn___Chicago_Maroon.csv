Soon Tom got chills spiked a fever of  and was put up in his parents fourposter bed PERIOD He fell into a coma for a week and Dr PERIOD Frank Wall from the University of Chicago Hospitals tried to open his sinuses to let him breathe PERIOD It was the first of two times before Tom reached age seven that the University Hospitals saved his life PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Wall pulled out Toms eyelashes and stuck a hypodermic needle through Toms eye socket beneath his eyethe doctors had to hold Tom down as he struggled and kicked through his nightmares PERIOD Toms mother was usually ushered out of the rooms during the procedures but she provided her own remedy PERIOD

VapoCresolene lamps a kind of quack cure from the Great Depression were a popular allpurpose fix PERIOD A kerosene lamp would heat a platter of liquid the instructions directed users to burn cresolene a coal tar derivative to kill spasmodic croup scarlet fever or diphtheria PERIOD It could even be used for animals the box said for the distemper and pneumonia in horses and does gapes and roup in fowls. mrs PERIOD Crane didnt trust cresolene and instead burned liquid eucalyptus in the lamps PERIOD Thats one of the few things Tom clearly remembers from his recovery PERIOD In the height of my pneumonia Id come out of the coma or a fitful sleep and Id ask her Light the lamp PERIOD Light the lamp Tom said PERIOD

When the fever finally broke Tom was nursed on pineapple juice PERIOD On Christmas morning he was so excited at the prospect of seeing the tree that he ventured out of bed on his own PERIOD His legs weak Tom stumbled and crawled down the hall leaning against the wall for support PERIOD His sister and cousin downstairs laughed at the toddler desperately grasping towards the Christmas tree falling over and over but when his mother asked they carried Tom to the tree PERIOD It was a delight just to see things he said PERIOD



This is the story Tom told me over a year ago when he called the campus newspaper the Chicago Maroon PERIOD Maybe his memory was sparked by something we had written about his old neighborhood or about some new research grant at the Medical Center his former employer PERIOD In surprising detail he told me about growing up on sixty-first and Drexel in the 1930s and his pneumonia PERIOD He went on about other visits to the hospital his time in the Army and his eventual job at the Universitys nuclear cyclotron during its heyday PERIOD

Tom came from a bluecollar background and lived in a twostory greystone just south of the Midwaystill there at  East sixty-first Street PERIOD Growing up around the University he saw frat houses fly banners with hammers and sickles on May Day and read yellow stencils on mailboxes Ban the ABomb Support the Communist Party. and now decades since hed left Tom wanted to see Woodlawn again PERIOD



Three years after his pneumonia Tom was back in the hospital PERIOD He had gone with his father on a fishing trip to Kankakee IL to get away from the city and his fathers backbreaking work as a roofer PERIOD When his father wasnt looking Tom climbed a tree and fell breaking his arm in a compound fracture above the elbow PERIOD The local county hospital set the arm in a metal cast so tight it cut off Toms circulation PERIOD The trip back to Chicago was torturous each bump on the road sending Tom into another fit of pain PERIOD

Toms family couldnt get him an appointment at the Medical Center until the next morning so his father cradled him in a rocking chair at home singing lullabies to soothe Toms moans PERIOD

Once admitted Tom passed through the Billings Hospitals marble rotunda on his way to see Dr PERIOD Howard Hatcher the Universitys first orthopedic resident PERIOD Hatcher took one look at the metal cast loosened the wing nuts holding it together and flung it into a trashcan PERIOD That cast is an instrument of torture and that county hospital will never see it again Hatcher said PERIOD He then pricked each of Toms fingers looking for any sign of feeling PERIOD With each finger that failed to twitch the odds of saving Toms arm from amputation shrank PERIOD Finally Toms pinky jerked PERIOD

Tom was sent to the childrens ward still screaming in pain PERIOD From his bed in the middle of the room Tom could see that the other children in the room were in worse shape than he was PERIOD One girl maybe four or five years old had broken her pelvis and had a cast from her waist to her ankles she cried constantly as the nurse turned her every which way to try and make her comfortable PERIOD A boy about Toms age had the bed next to the window which let in the soft spring breeze carrying the smell of newly cut grass from the Midway PERIOD The boy was despondent and would only stare out the window singing Bring back bring back bring back my Bonnie to me. tom was awoken that first night by flashlights and ghostly figures moving about the room PERIOD The figures spoke in low whispers and gently lifted him onto a litter with wheels PERIOD He was whisked to a room with equipment that glowed with a bluishwhite light he was brought back to this room night after night PERIOD This Tom would realize years later when he worked at the Medical Center was the operating room Dr PERIOD Hatcher used to work on his arm PERIOD Toms family couldnt afford surgery so Hatcher stole hours after his shift to work pro bono PERIOD

Perhaps thats because Tom surrounds himself with his past PERIOD He and his wife still sleep on the same fourposter bed he slept in during his pneumonia PERIOD He owns two VapoCresolene lamps and eucalyptus extracta dollar each on eBay PERIOD He knows and has written drafts of the life story of Dr PERIOD Wall details culled from working with his protgs at the Medical Center and research done on his own time PERIOD Tom wrote letters to Walls son a doctor himself and tracked both the careers of father and son PERIOD

Whenever Tom tells his own story he starts with the  Columbian Exposition PERIOD He likes to start at the beginning he said and the Worlds Fair and the University of Chicago are tied together in his mind PERIOD The University was like a giant medieval castle in that the populace was drawn in around it he said PERIOD But the seemingly stuffy subjects and the lack of a football team kept Tom and his family from respecting the University PERIOD People from Woodlawn used to look at the University as being a little out of the mainstream he said PERIOD Being in a workingclass family you couldnt understand the intellectual concepts PERIOD It was above you. woodlawn was tough in the 1940s and Tom and his friends were no exception PERIOD University graduate students often visited the neighborhood to study people like Tom PERIOD You know gangs urban people he said PERIOD Two studentsa slender Swedish couple on thinwheeled bicyclesoften hung out with Tom and his friends PERIOD One day he didnt show up but she did PERIOD She was lucky to get out of there Tom said PERIOD Youre a Communist PERIOD You believe in sharing things my friends said PERIOD How would you like to share some of that with us Tom grimaces as he remembers his friends closing in on the woman before she ran off PERIOD When I say the guys I hung around with had a different perspectivewhat we saw around the University was a little removed. toms perception changed when he was delivering pizzas as a teenager in Hyde Park PERIOD Without a football team on campus Tom was taken aback to see a hulking grad student answer the door on one delivery PERIOD When he found out the student played football in college Tom asked how a football player managed to get into such a rigorous graduate program PERIOD He gave me such a lecture on being scholarly Tom said PERIOD He began dreaming of getting out of Woodlawn and going to college PERIOD I dont know if he knows to this day what an impact he had on my life. around the same time Toms father a pinochle and threecushion billiard champ opened a gas station near their house PERIOD His fathers connections to organized crime ensured that runners of the policy rackets visited the station to pay their respects and keep it afloat PERIOD

His first job was a bit of shock assisting professors at the Fermi Institutes underground cyclotron PERIOD The cyclotron one of the most complex pieces of equipment on campus was used to study radioactive particles PERIOD And here I was with only seven college credits Tom said PERIOD I went to night school under the G.I PERIOD Bill PERIOD Only seven college credits so far and I was working around nuclear physicists. tom took Geiger readings throughout the complex and assisted researchers in dozens of experiments PERIOD The selfstyled kid from Woodlawn was soon a part of the University community PERIOD Grad students shared their latest findings with him and during their downtime tutored Tom in the college math classes he was taking PERIOD They were such a giving bunch of people he said PERIOD

The labs work soon turned to radioactive materials medical applications and Tom was transferred to the Medical Center PERIOD As cancer patients elected to receive radioactive implants Tom prepared the materials and watched in the operating room PERIOD For any isotopes that were put into patients we had to be there he said PERIOD

But the methods used at the Medical Center werent initially successful and Tom had to attend dozens of postmortems PERIOD After being saved twice by the hospital himself he now saw patients who werent as lucky PERIOD I saw a lot of death and dying he said PERIOD It made me appreciate things more. tom suggested we visit his old house together but his wife Madeline was initially against the plan PERIOD Even though his memory of the distant past is clear Toms stroke makes him easily confused about the present PERIOD He can forget what train hes supposed to catch or where hes going PERIOD Tom was insistent though PERIOD His wife relented as long as she could come alongso my girlfriend and I picked both of them up from the train station PERIOD
