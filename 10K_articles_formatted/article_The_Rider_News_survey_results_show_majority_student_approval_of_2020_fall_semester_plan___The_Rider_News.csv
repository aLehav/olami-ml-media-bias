As students return for the first week of inperson classes a survey conducted by The Rider News revealed that a majority of students have been pleased with Riders fall reopening plan with only some worrying details about the coronavirus regulations on campus PERIOD

Students wish the fall plan had been better communicated according to preliminary feedback from a survey by The Rider News PERIOD By Tatyanna Carmanhttpst.coQjgzU83Mxm

There were  participants in The Rider News student survey which ran from Sept PERIOD  to Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Overall  of participants approve of the updated  fall semester education plan while  do not PERIOD

The plan is fine except for three weeks virtual and the rest in person sophomore arts and entertainment industries management major Rachel Katz said PERIOD I think it should be one or the other PERIOD Its very confusing when they let you choose because every class is different and it makes it very messy PERIOD I am commuting this semester but I feel more comfortable going to my inperson classes with the mandatory masks and people reporting symptoms each day who live on campus. master of Arts in teaching graduate student Alexander Kuhn said that he does not approve of the updated  fall semester education plan and said he was lucky to have an instructor whos decided to remain fully remote but not everybody can be so fortunate. however the university gave students the option to take classes fully remotely for the entire fall semester and in a universitywide email sent on Aug PERIOD  said that students who have chosen this class modality may continue to do so. i think reopening the campus in any capacity is dangerous and asking for trouble Kuhn said PERIOD Its the duty of the university administration to manage risk even if that means taking personal risk management responsibility out of the hands of students and faculty PERIOD Make the difficult decisions that you have the power to make so that others arent forced to. as for the safety plan he said that the plan feels like a lowest common denominator situation. follow guidelines for reopening but dont really go any further than that PERIOD It feels like the easy way out the path of least resistance Kuhn said PERIOD Lets face it students selfreporting on an app isnt going to do anything. according to the survey results  of the student participants prefer inperson classes  prefer remote  prefer synchronous hybrid with realtime virtual class meetings and  prefer asynchronous hybrid with no realtime virtual classes PERIOD

These student selfreported course preferences however do not reflect current class offerings PERIOD Only  of fall courses are fully in person according to data presented at convocation by Rider President Gregory DellOmo PERIOD

The vast majority of courses    are fully remote and  are hybrids according to DellOmos presentation PERIOD

Some students had mixed feelings about their class modalities PERIOD

Kuhn said that in the current climate fullyonline is not only preferable but necessary especially for graduatelevel education PERIOD

Katz said Currently I like the hybrid model PERIOD I am excited to go back in person PERIOD I dont mind online classes but they are very hard to manage and its going to feel good to have at least one thing that is back to normal. sophomore accounting major Matthew Swinehart said he looks forward to the day when we can have inperson classes again without any safety concerns but thinks its safer to do virtual classes for now PERIOD

Master of Arts in teaching graduate student Sophia Brana explained that she would have liked to have some inperson classes this semester because teaching is a very handson experiencebased profession and felt like she did not get the graduate school experience she anticipated PERIOD

I feel like I have missed out on a lot of learning opportunities that come with meeting classmates and collaborating in ways that Zoom just cant support Brana said PERIOD Spring  was my first semester at Rider so I did not have much of an opportunity to experience the campus or learn in a classroom setting. of the  of classes that are fully remote this semester  are fully or partially synchronous and  are asynchronous according to university data PERIOD

Sixtysix percent of students who took the survey approved of the universitys communication about the  fall semester plan to the Rider community and . did not PERIOD

In contrast Katz said that she found Riders communication to be really not satisfactory. i understand they were figuring everything out still but they waited so long to tell us changed the plan and nothing seemed to ever be for certain Katz said PERIOD The lack of communication throughout the summer months made many students anxious and it was something I think Rider should have worked on. swinehart said that he wished the university waited for the original deadline to announce whether Rider would return to inperson classes or remain virtual PERIOD

Instead of waiting until Friday to make the decision Rider did so on Tuesday and said we had to cancel our room before Monday of next week or else wed be fined for not doing so Swinehart said PERIOD I held out for a couple of days but then canceled my room PERIOD Several hours later the announcement came in wed possibly be able to go back which was confirmed Friday PERIOD The fact that I would have to go through the housing selection process for a third time and not be guaranteed my formerly picked room or have to room with a random played a major part in my final decision. we will do our best to honor the previously held housing assignment the email read PERIOD

Swinehart also said that he would like to see a better breakdown of new coronavirus cases on campus PERIOD

I understand concerns on privacy and such but if the university wants students to be more careful and aware they should publish where a case or cluster originated from and make it easily accessible for students staff and family to see Swinehart said PERIOD Even though Im living at home I still have several friends that went back so of course Im concerned about their safety. kuhn also did not approve of the universitys communication about the  fall semester plan and said it was insufficient but could easily be remedied with a regular weekly update either on the Rider homepage or via email PERIOD

Fiftyfour percent of student participants that live on campus think social distancing and mask restrictions have been adhered to as opposed to the . of students who do not think they have been PERIOD

Caption The Rider News survey showed that more than half of student survey participants think that social distancing and mask restrictions are being adhered to PERIOD

Senior psychology major and community assistant CA in Beckett Village Alyssa Darden said that she wasnt surprised by these results PERIOD

That doesnt surprise me but I also wouldnt be surprised if it were higher Darden said PERIOD Were not able to see what happens behind closed doors and if residents are actually adhering to the one guest within the same building while maintaining  feet and wearing masks policy. fiftyfive percent of students who took the survey and live on campus reported difficulties joining Zoom classes or performing other classwork online due to problems with NoWires campus WIFi or campus wired ethernet connections PERIOD Fortyfour percent said that they did not have issues with this PERIOD

Before classes started I lost WiFi connection on campus once due a thunderstorm Darden said I know that the college is currently working to get their servers offline so that we dont lose WiFi every time the power goes out PERIOD Im not sure if the building youre in effects your WiFi connection but I havent had any problems in Beckett Village. the majority of the survey respondents live offcampus with family or others who are not Rider students with  PERIOD Twentythree percent live on campus at Rider and  live with Rider students offcampus PERIOD

Associate Vice President for University Marketing and Communications Kristine Brown declined to comment PERIOD

Katz Swinehart and Brana live with their families PERIOD Kuhn lives offcampus with friends PERIOD

I know the University administration and teaching faculty are human PERIOD I know that these are impossible questions to answer and theyre under a lot of pressure Kuhn said PERIOD No decision is going to satisfy  of people but from my perspective there is an answer that keeps people as close to  safe as possible PERIOD I think we would all benefit from more transparency PERIOD Let us see the rationale behind the decisions that are being made and let us see that there are human beings making them PERIOD We all have to be understanding right now and there are measures that make that easier.",The Rider News survey results show majority student approval of 2020 fall semester plan â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
