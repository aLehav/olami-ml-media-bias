Director of Campus Safety Holly Nieto announced earlier this month that she will be retiring at the end of the semester PERIOD A presence on campus for the past  years Nieto became known this year for her Oxy has a plan for that emails about emergency preparedness PERIOD She also received and compiled data for Clery Act reporting PERIOD An April  email from Dean of Students Barbara Avery informed the campus about her retirement PERIOD  Nieto did not specify her reasons for leaving PERIOD

Im not comfortable talking about some of it but I will simply tell you that its time Nieto said PERIOD

Nieto has worked in many positions at Occidental and within Campus Safety PERIOD As the Director of Campus Safety she was the head of operations alongside former Campus Safety Lt PERIOD Joseph Cunje and oversaw Clery Act compliance and emergency preparedness PERIOD According to Nieto when Cunje went on medical leave in January  the workload became more than she alone could manage PERIOD Chief of Campus Safety Sean Kennedy took over the operations side when he joined Occidental in August  and Nieto dedicated her time to the Clery Act and emergency preparedness system PERIOD The Clery Act mandates that the college disclose certain types of crimes in an Annual Security Report among other requirements PERIOD This report includes crime statistics from the previous three calendar years and is due to the federal government on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

I will have the report done before I leave come the proverbial hell or high water it will be done because after  years I dont want to leave the college with unfinished business Nieto said PERIOD

Allegations that the school was underreporting sexual assaults led to the current investigation by the Department of Education for violations of the Clery Act PERIOD Nieto expressed annoyance with the way in which reports of sexual assaults were handled and communicated to her office PERIOD  Its incredibly frustrating for someone sitting in my chair or wearing the sparkly shoes that Im wearing to have to deal with people who say I know something but Im not going to tell you what it is but Im going to hold you accountable for making sure its reported correctly Nieto said PERIOD We make every attempt possible to categorize sexual assault reports correctly. according to Associate Dean of Students Tim Chang who oversees Campus Safety the college has begun searching for a Clery Act Coordinator to take over when Nieto leaves at the end of June PERIOD The new position will only deal with Clery Act compliance and Kennedy and Environmental Health and Safety Manager Bruce Steele will take over maintaining the colleges emergency preparedness systems PERIOD

When we find a replacement well find someone with good knowledge of the Clery Act but what we cant replace is someone who knows the intersection of the Clery and Oxy Chang said PERIOD There will be a steep learning curve for anyone coming in. nieto came to Occidental in  from California Institute of Technology after seeing a job posting in the L.A PERIOD Times PERIOD She joined the department now known as Facilities and ascended to supervisor roles PERIOD During this time she developed the work order system that allows the college to track how much it spends on maintenance of buildings PERIOD When Campus Safety merged with Facilities in  Nieto volunteered to fill the role of manager of Campus Safety PERIOD

Campus Safety was primarily looking for somebody who was a good administrator and also had a good appreciation for law enforcement and I said I can do that They said Well what makes you think you can do that which was a fair question to them because I had pulled that one on them so often Nieto said PERIOD

Upon revealing her past as a corrections officer at the Federal Department of Justice Nieto got the job as manager and has remained in the Campus Safety department ever since PERIOD

Shes worn a lot of hats a lot and some of its because other people didnt want to wear that hat so she said Ok lets do it Campus Safety Sgt PERIOD Claudia Conde said PERIOD  Nietos last day is June  but she will remain in campus housing until the end of January PERIOD According to Human Resources Office Manager Nicole Plascensia employees are generally required to leave campus housing within  days of retiring but Nieto explained that the extra months will allow her to find alternate living accommodations PERIOD In her absence she believes that the college can grow from the contentious sexual assault debate PERIOD

My biggest hope is that we learn to trust each other again and engage in those robust conversations civilly Nieto said PERIOD Occidental has been a constant piece of fabric through my life so I would want it to do nothing but get stronger and nicer and keep doing the amazing things we do. this article has been archived for more requests please contact us via the support system PERIOD
