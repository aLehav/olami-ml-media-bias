All four students injured in a rocket explosion Thursday night at the University of Idaho are out of surgery and recovering PERIOD

Dan Ewart University of Idaho vice president of infrastructure would not confirm the identities of these students but said during a press conference Friday morning that three of the students are engineering majors and associated with the universitys branch of the Northwest Organization of Rocket Engineers NORE PERIOD

Grant Thurman a member of NORE told the MoscowPullman Daily News that both copresidents of the club were involved in the experiment and explosion PERIOD Bailey LindTrefts and Daniel Furman were said to be in stable condition by a Gritman Medical Center health supervisor PERIOD The other two students have not yet been identified PERIOD

Thurman said one copresident igniting the rocket fuel wore a face mask while the other only wore eye protection PERIOD

A faculty adviser was present during the event Ewart said but he would not confirm the identity of this adviser or whether the individual is associated with NORE PERIOD

Sophomore Lennin Rodriguez a computer science major at UI said that he arrived on scene when the fire department was spraying down the rocket which was smoking. he identified NORE adviser T PERIOD Rick Fletcher UI department of chemistry associate professor as the only UI faculty member on scene he could make out PERIOD

I only recognized my chem professor from last year he said PERIOD So I figured it was school sanctioned. in his opening address about the incident at the press conference this morning Ewert said the students were working on a project which required testing rocket fuel. however he could not confirm the type of rocket fuel used in the experiment PERIOD

Students were a part of a student club that was working on testing rocket fuel designed for model rockets Ewart said PERIOD

Moscow Police received a report of the explosion at  p.m PERIOD on Thursday and responded to the parking lot east of the universitys steam plant on Sixth Street where the explosion occurred PERIOD

As of this morning all police tape was taken down from the scene but wood debris remains scattered around the parking lot PERIOD Moscow Police Chief James Fry Jr PERIOD said the area is safe PERIOD

Fry said that use of devices which require shooting a projectile or will emit debris into the air has to be regulated and granted permission by the Moscow Police PERIOD

Ewert said that the experiment was not intended to have a projectile shot into the air PERIOD The university sanctions the club but this particular experiment is still being investigated PERIOD

The injured individual who was in critical condition was taken out of there first Rodriguez said PERIOD Not sure but I heard something about his chest cavity being severely injured. junior Scott Jones chemistry and anthropology major at UI arrived on scene after hearing the explosion from the sidewalk outside of St PERIOD Augustines Catholic Center PERIOD

It wasnt the explosion of a firework it didnt have that deep bellow of a mortar or a high pitch of a fire cracker but it was that sound of destruction Jones said sort of like the sounds of explosions in videos you see from Syria. jones said he arrived before the police tape was set up and stood about  feet from the responders behind a metal barrier that borders the parking lot PERIOD He said he initially counted three victims and saw around  personnel working on the victim closest to the smoke cloud PERIOD

There was one guy who could sit up Jones said PERIOD He had about an inch or inchandahalf gash on his left arm. ewert said that the Energy Plant parking lot and building are safe for students and faculty class and street closures will not be applied PERIOD

Editors note This article has been updated and revised to reflect that Gritman Medical Center was not involved in identifying the copresidents of NORE or their involvement in the incident PERIOD
