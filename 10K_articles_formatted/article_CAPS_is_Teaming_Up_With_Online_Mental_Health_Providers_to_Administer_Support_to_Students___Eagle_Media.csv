Student and Community Counseling Center is located on FGCUs campus and is open to all PERIOD

Alex McBride and Eddie StewartNovember  

FGCU has established a partnership with online mental health support resources Uwill and Togetherall just in time to assist students in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian PERIOD

The partnership was announced on the Instagram page of FGCUs Counseling and Psychological Services Department on Sept PERIOD  less than two weeks before Hurricane Ian hit southwest Florida PERIOD

As we all know college students are going through a tough time right now which is why we are pleased to announce that we have partnered with UWill and Togetherall CAPS Senior Director Dr PERIOD Jon Brunner said in an announcement sent to FGCUs faculty PERIOD

Uwill is a teletherapy service students can use to connect with a therapist virtually through a video chat phone call or messaging system PERIOD Togetherall is an online peer mental health support group PERIOD Students can connect with their peers anonymously in an environment monitored by mental health professionals to express their thoughts and concerns PERIOD Both services are free for FGCU students PERIOD

Our students for the most part like to come and be seen in person but we still have students who want to be seen via telehealth CAPS Director of Outreach and Prevention Dr PERIOD Julie Rego said PERIOD

These services were promoted in FGCUs posthurricane email updates as alternatives to CAPS services PERIOD While CAPS was offering brief crisis meetings for students they were unable to facilitate regular standing appointments due to limited staffing PERIOD

An individual named James wanted to remain anonymous in keeping with the nature of the program PERIOD James saw an advertisement and decided to try it out PERIOD

Its easier to get into than something like CAPS James said PERIOD I didnt think Id stay with the site very long but Ive found someones post that I really relate to and Ive been writing a pretty long response PERIOD Its nice to be a positive force in others lives. leighanna Ackerman and Mikayla Rivera student volunteers with FGCUs Prevention and Wellness Services believe that these resources can make therapy services more accessible to students PERIOD

Its a great service for students especially if they cant get in with a therapist at CAPS right away Ackerman said PERIOD I know sometimes there is a really long waitlist. aside from being unable to meet with a CAPS therapist due to a lack of availability some students may also be physically unable to come to campus PERIOD

Now with the hurricane and everything maybe people need help but they cant drive or they just lost their car Rivera said PERIOD At least if they have internet they can still do it from their house. as of Oct PERIOD  inperson CAPS meetings are open for scheduling but Uwill and Togetherall arent going anywhere anytime soon PERIOD

Teletherapy is here to stay Dr PERIOD Rego said PERIOD
