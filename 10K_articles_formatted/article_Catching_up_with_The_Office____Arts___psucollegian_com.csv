For a while now I had no idea what anyone was talking about when they referred to The Office  PERIOD The show now in its fifth season has been wildly popular for years but I had been completely clueless when it came to any discussions on  or the crazy antics of the DunderMifflin employees PERIOD

So back in September while looking online for something to amuse myself with while I should have been doing homework I decided to watch the pilot episode ...and then another....and then another until after only three days I had completed the entire first two seasons PERIOD Completely addicted to the absurd office pranks and the adorably awkward will theywont they relationship of Jim and Pam I became determined to catch up with the current season PERIOD I watched episode after episode until the wee hours of the morning PERIOD When my roommate would yell at me to do something productive whenever she heard the muffled theme song coming from my earphones Id find clever ways to cover my addiction up with a Word document when shed walk past my computer PERIOD

I quickly finished the next two seasons and when I was finally able to start watching the show live on Thursday nights I was pretty disappointed with what I found PERIOD

Season  of the show got off to a rocky start PERIOD Engaged but living in different states Jim and Pam no longer had the fire that made the early stages of their relationship so great PERIOD While Steve Carell is hysterical as the painfully needy boss one Michael Scott is more than enough and Holly his female counterpart was unbelievably irritating PERIOD

Last weeks episode however was a pleasant surprise and hopefully a move back to the shows better days PERIOD Holly is gone not a moment too soon and Jim and Pam finally got a chance to interact again if only by Bluetooth phone PERIOD

Best of all the episode features what might have been the funniest JimDwight scene in a very very long time PERIOD Check it out

Lets hope this was only a taste of the better episodes to come PERIOD
