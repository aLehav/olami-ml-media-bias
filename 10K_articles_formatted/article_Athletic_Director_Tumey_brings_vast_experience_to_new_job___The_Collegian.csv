4090,2023-11-03,"when Terry Tumey was officially introduced as Fresno States director of athletics during the summer excitement abounded for the future of the schools athletic program PERIOD

Fresno State hired Tumey after a long search to replace interim director of athletics Steve Robertello who had taken over that role after the tumultuous ending to Steve Bartkos tenure .Bartko resigned and later claimed that he was forced out by Fresno State administration officials PERIOD

Tumey brings athletic honors with him to his new job PERIOD He was a standout college football player at UCLA from  during which he was named AllPacific10 Conference defensive lineman three times PERIOD

Speaking to The Collegian Tumey said he believes that has provided him a unique perspective that can help him relate to student athletes in a way others perhaps may not be able to PERIOD

I can relate to some of the stresses that a student athlete faces balancing classes trying to balance your time trying to make sure that theres a life after your playing days and trying to take some of the same principles that you learned from playing in terms of your work and dedication toward a goal and try to relate that to what you do in other facets of your life Tumey said PERIOD

And Tumey knows the challenges of studentathletes from his previous experiences working in sports administration at other schools in California PERIOD

Before making his way to Fresno State Tumey honed his skills as an administrator at ClaremontMuddScripps a unified Division III athletic program including the schools Claremont Mckenna College Harvey Mudd College and Scripps College and eventually made an impact at UC Davis all as the director of athletics PERIOD

At UC Davis Tumey showed off one of his biggest strengths as an administrator one that could prove vitally important to his success or failure at Fresno Stateworking with a budget and raising money PERIOD

Tumey helped expand the profile of the school both regionally and nationally and secured funding in excess of  million to support student achievements PERIOD

In addition Tumey supervised all fiscal responsibilities as director of football administration which carried a budget of  million PERIOD

At Fresno State he will undertake the task of finding adequate financial support for  athletic programs in a  million budget PERIOD

Despite the welldocumented financial stress that the athletics program has been under Tumey said there is no real threat as of now to cut any sports at Fresno State PERIOD

Weve been in an environment of cutting programs which has happened in the last I would say five to  years PERIOD You know Fresno State has has kind of what the opposite PERIOD So I dont think Fresno State is in the business of cutting programs he said
