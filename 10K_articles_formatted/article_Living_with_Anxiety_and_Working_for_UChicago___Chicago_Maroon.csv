2177,2022-03-16,"anxiety has permeated every aspect of my almost  years on this campus first as a grad student and now as a librarian PERIOD To be fair I have generalized anxiety disorder so anxiety would be a part of my life regardless of where I worked PERIOD But my experience is that the culture of this campus cultivates anxiety which makes living with an anxiety disorder a daily slog PERIOD Here are my observations of why that is

Hierarchy hierarchy hierarchy PERIOD

The University feels like a feudal kingdomor a collection of fiefdoms within a feudal kingdom each one arranged in hierarchical relation to the others and each with its own hierarchical system PERIOD Much of our time is spent trying to move up or function within the hierarchy while avoiding the wrath of the powerful PERIOD Who has the power to fix a problem Am I allowed to speak to them directly or do I need to cc a supervisor Do I need to cc a supervisor anyway in order to make sure my request is taken seriously Its exhausting PERIOD And it makes it really hard to form and foster human connections or to know someones true intentions PERIOD My anxiety disorder makes me project all my insecurities onto others PERIOD If youre already prone to assuming everyone hates you and that you dont belong the dehumanizing effects of a strict hierarchy will amplify and give authority to those feelings PERIOD

A lack of communication and transparency PERIOD

The primary currency of our fiefdoms is information your place in the hierarchy is measured by your access to information PERIOD Information is hoarded by those at the top and doled out in small chunks through the labyrinthine committee structure itself a hierarchy PERIOD Or its transmitted behind closed doors by a supervisor to a favored staff member or in Friday afternoon mass emails to the entire community announcing sweeping changes to things no one thought needed fixing PERIOD But even if you are one of the favored or on one of the important committees youre likely not involved in any impactful decisionmaking PERIOD Youre there as a sounding board for whoever convenes the group and who will be making the decisions regardless of your input PERIOD Its infuriating PERIOD But it also makes it really hard to just do your job PERIOD My anxiety disorder makes me catastrophize. i envision everything that could go wrong PERIOD One way to manage those thoughts which can get really scary is to strategize how you would react if something went wrong PERIOD But when crucial information is withheld on a daily basis and there is no clear method for accessing that information strategizing just creates more anxiety PERIOD

Policies unenforced overenforced or nonexistent PERIOD

Do you know your departments policy for family leave For working from home For dress code For purchasing an ergonomic chair For requesting comp time For using email Would you know where to find these policies if you wanted to read them I dont PERIOD When I ask my colleagues I receive wildly different answers PERIOD Few can point to written policies and even when they can theres no guarantee they are uniformly followed PERIOD The result I literally cannot follow the rules because I dont know them or because they dont exist or because Ive been told the wrong thing or because theyve changed and no one told me PERIOD Clarity and simplicity help me manage the nonstop chaos of secondguessing that my anxiety disorder evokes PERIOD In this environment of uncertainty I struggle with the constant feeling that I may be breaking the rules and wont be able to defend myself against repercussions PERIOD

These aspects of our culture trigger anxiety while creating an environment that makes it really hard to manage anxiety PERIOD They also represent deep structural problems that feel insurmountable PERIOD Even the simplest of issues can lead to a morass that leaves me feeling like the entire system is designed to unwind all my best efforts to not have a panic attack in my office PERIOD Even worse are the days when my experience of situational anxiety is denied by folks who because they do not have the same experience cant or wont acknowledge that a given situation could cause anxiety PERIOD

I have a lot of days when I feel like this campus is a lost cause and nothing will ever change it will only continue to be terrible in different ways PERIOD That said I know that Im not alone and that many of us are struggling against these forces PERIOD But we need help PERIOD We need to be part of the decisionmaking process PERIOD We need to be trusted PERIOD We need to be able to trust our leadership PERIOD We need a genuine commitment to building a culture of empathy and support in which we can all thrive PERIOD
