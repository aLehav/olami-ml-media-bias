Warning This article possesses an excess of references to Star Wars lore so expect nothing less than absolute nerdiness from this review and analysis PERIOD

Also there are spoilers ahead

It has been over  days since the first season of The Mandalorian finished with a final scene of Moff Gideon standing on top of a crashed Xwing an iconic and legendary lightsaber clenched in his fist PERIOD Fans have long debated and theorized what the second season might have in store for us but Jon Favreau still manages to deliver more than one surprise to the audience while creating what is undoubtedly the best episode of The Mandalorian yet PERIOD

First lets start with the obvious The Marshall is an episode that is full of Easter eggs PERIOD It reintroduces a beloved character from the first season gives us an up close and personal look at Boba Fetts armor and even references Anakin Skywalkers podracer with the bike Cobb Vanth rides PERIOD Many people believe that it was actually made from the original podcracer but due to the slight differences and the  or so years that have passed I think its little more than a similar design and a reference for fans PERIOD However while giving viewers such nostalgic and exciting moments The Mandalorian also stays true to its main characters PERIOD

When Din Djarin was first introduced he was treated as a Westernstyle character PERIOD He sidled into an ancient space saloon started and finished a fight and cooly took his quarry prisoner PERIOD This Western theme persisted throughout the show even as Din became a father to a tiny green child with mystical powers and fought off the remains of an oppressive and tyrannical government PERIOD Dins character developed and went through changes but just as nothing could scratch his shiny beskar armor he remained a solid Western figure throughout the first season PERIOD The first episode of the second season quickly reassures fans that this theme is far from dead in fact it is reinforced PERIOD

From astereotypical almostshootout in Mos Pelgo to the beautiful cinematography of riding away on a swoop bike across the Dune Sea we are constantly reminded that Din is the badass character that comes into town does some amazing feat and then leaves with nothing more than his reputation behind him PERIOD He has Baby Yoda The Child with him now but that only makes him more dangerous and this first episode reassures viewers that the aweinspiring fight scenes of the first season will likely pale in comparison to the second season PERIOD

In reestablishing the Western theme and reasserting that Din is a dangerous yet caring man who can do ridiculously amazing things even without the Force The Mandalorian goes back to its and Star Wars roots and builds upon them PERIOD It also uses a similar tactic when building upon the world of Tatooine PERIOD

In The Marshall Favreau took perhaps a total of  minutes of screen time from A New Hope and turned it into an entirely new and fresh storyline PERIOD The krayt dragon skeleton that C3P0 wanders past becomes a living and terrifying threat PERIOD The echoing shriek that ObiWan Kenobi uses to scare the Sand People away from Luke Skywalker becomes a central rivalry between two ancient species PERIOD Even the moment in which Lando Calrissian blows up the second Death Star is shown to have rippling effects that are before unseen PERIOD Viewers are gifted with an indepth look at how Tatooine has fared in the aftermath of the Empires fall and the nasty history between the settlers and the Sand People PERIOD Additionally the exact appearance habits and dangers of the krayt dragon are demonstrated for the first time PERIOD

But in building this extended world Favreau does not just reference moments from the fourth and sixth movies of the franchise he also references moments from some of the only other Star Wars content that has done an indepth analysis of Sand People and their culture John Jackson Millers novel Kenobi. this book now belonging to Legends originally gave fans a view into both ObiWans life after Order  and Tatooines Sand People before Disney bought the franchise and rebooted the continuity PERIOD With ObiWans life in exile soon to be covered in an upcoming television series The Mandalorian has taken the reins on educating fans on the Sand People their customs and their relationships with the settlers PERIOD Still there are many references to Kenobi and other Legends material that show that despite Star Wars being a twisted convoluted mess it still honors its own content PERIOD

The most obvious reference to previously retconned material is Cobb wearing Boba Fetts armor PERIOD In Legends Jodo Kast paints a set of Mandalorian armor to resemble Boba Fetts in order to charge more for his jobs but eventually dies at the hand of Boba himself PERIOD Therefore another man being inside Boba Fetts armor was almost expected though Cobbs story was definitely a new take on the idea PERIOD

The majority of the references to Kenobi however involve the settlers and the Sand People PERIOD In Kenobi settlers use a siren to warn them of danger though it actually sounds like a krayt dragon call and is meant to scare off the Sand People PERIOD In The Mandalorian the siren is an early warning system against the krayt dragon itself PERIOD A saloon also serves as the central location of both of the main settings of Kenobi and The Marshall though the saloons are manned by two very different owners PERIOD Additionally the heightened tensions between the Sand People and the settlers are similar between the two stories though Kenobi has no third party threat to bring the two groups together beyond a conniving settler named Orrin Gault PERIOD

One more thing to note is what The Mandalorian does differently as established in the first season Din is able to communicate with the Sand People using their own hand signals PERIOD ObiWan is also able to speak with the Sand People in Kenobi though only due to one of the Sand People speaking passable Basic PERIOD The Mandalorian takes that extra step to show appreciation and knowledge of a strange culture whereas Kenobi has the Sand People somewhat abide by the uniformity of the known galaxy and do all of the legwork in establishing communication PERIOD It is an excellent example of how The Mandalorian is basing its story off of its predecessors but still forging its own unique path PERIOD

In the first episode of this season Favreau has taken a conglomeration of preexisting lore and information and sculpted it into something fantastic PERIOD The worldbuilding is not hindered by the heart pumping action scenes and Dins skills in battle are not undermined by his diplomatic efforts PERIOD Favreau also artfully maneuvers around the return of the actual Boba Fett until the very last moment tying up a loose end that viewers hadnt even noticed while shocking the audience in the same breath PERIOD With Bobas return it is surely only a matter of time until other iconic characters such as Ahsoka Tano and perhaps even Sabine Wren make appearances and the creative team are sure to treat those characters with the same levity as they did Boba PERIOD

However amidst the skillful worldbuilding of this episode there remains one aspect of Tatooine that remains in shadow the slaves PERIOD Cobb spoke briefly of the enslavement of his town but there is no information about the beings who were enslaved prior to Return of the Jedi and their fate after Leia Organa strangled Jabba the Hutt to death with her own chain PERIOD The Phantom Menace introduced a side of Tatooine culture that had yet to be examined prior to the films release PERIOD But even now stories like Kenobi and The Mandalorian seem content to continue focusing on the Westernized scum and villainy of Tatooine as opposed to the people who surely must have gained their freedom when the Hutt empire on Tatooine crumbled PERIOD There is a lack of information about the people and the culture that Anakin Skywalker belonged to prior to becoming a Jedi and The Mandalorian not addressing that was the only true downside of this episode PERIOD

Regardless the information and aspects of the Star Wars universe were welldone and enjoyable PERIOD It is a must watch for anyone remotely interested in Star Wars or anyone remotely interested in watching the best show that Disney has to offer PERIOD It is safe to say that The Mandalorian season two has begun with a bangliterally PERIOD
