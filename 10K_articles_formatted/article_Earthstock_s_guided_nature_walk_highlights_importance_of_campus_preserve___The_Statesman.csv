In preparation of the Earthstock Festival on April  the Friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve led a guided nature walk through the campus Ashley Schiff Preserve on April  PERIOD

Friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve is a nonprofit organization that maintains the preserve and advocates for its permanent protection PERIOD

Strolling through the preserve is a longstanding tradition in memoriam of the late political science professor Ashley Schiff Ph.D. PERIOD According to the Friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve website he devoted much of his time and energy to protecting the trees and natural attributes the university PERIOD

After Dr PERIOD Schiffs unexpected passing in  colleagues worked together to save the  acres of land between Nicolls Road and Marburger Drive PERIOD Former university President John S PERIOD Toll and former United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall dedicated the land to him in  PERIOD

Hes the reason why we have trees on campus Michael Schrimpf a Ph.D PERIOD candidate in the department of ecology and evolution and president of Friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve said PERIOD

Due to the recent construction of the new residence and dining halls on John S PERIOD Toll Drive the foliage on campus continues to diminish PERIOD The construction cleared . acres of trees for both the new residence hall site and extended parking PERIOD

Ultimately in my opinion whether campus development is good or bad depends on how it is balanced against its environmental costs Schrimpf said PERIOD When we cut down some forest to build up the campus maybe we can set some remaining forest aside in new preserves as a tradeoff. stony Brook publicized the nature walk on the Earthstock schedule however only two people attended PERIOD Friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve offers an escape from the doldrums and busy lifestyle of college every week but very few are informed of the schools natural treasures PERIOD

Attendance at the nature walks really varies PERIOD Sometimes its as high as five to six per week but most weeks there are only one or two PERIOD Some weeks no one shows up Schrimpf said PERIOD

Helen Liu a senior linguistics and health science double major confused the preserve with the meager bridge that connects Kelly Quad and the Student Activities Center parking lot when asked if she knew of the preserves location PERIOD I know about it but I never knew where it was Liu said PERIOD

I was not aware of the preserve area and about Ashley Schiff Sang Eun Oh a junior linguistics major and one of the attendants said PERIOD Thanks to the walk its a great pleasure knowing what hed done for the campus PERIOD I want to introduce that place to my friends. friends of the Ashley Schiff Preserve is currently working on its social media presence to better inform the Stony Brook community about the preserve PERIOD

We finally fixed our website that we made in the early 90s Schrimpf said PERIOD Right now were trying to update our Facebook more frequently and hopefully we can get people to start submitting photos of the woods. schrimpf ended the walk with a story and lesson to all Theres a legend about Ashley Schiff PERIOD Before they paved Circle Road people said he tied himself to the tallest conifer tree to protect its life PERIOD He won and they left it alone but after his death no one even realized the tree was cut down PERIOD Its a lesson to us to make sure to stay vigilant if its something you want to protect. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
