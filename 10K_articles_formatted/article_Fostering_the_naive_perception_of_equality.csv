The abstract concept of fairness is at the core of almost every argument debate and law PERIOD It is a tragedy that so much time and energy is devoted and subsequently wasted to the pathetic pursuit of the construction of a society founded under the inherently flawed premise that all people are created equal and that people should be afforded each and every opportunity basically fairness PERIOD

Fairness just like the ohsonovel pat on the back concept of human equality in reality does not exist in any tangible form PERIOD Absolutely nothing is fair other than perhaps the odds of calling heads or tails in a coin flip and even then we can sit and complain about the way the coin was flipped PERIOD Fairness is a simply a perspective One persons bemoaned apples for lunch everyday could be another persons banquet in heaven PERIOD Its completely subjective and completely ridiculous PERIOD

The idea that in this society people think that everyone deserves a fair chance and that life should be fair is folly PERIOD It is useless PERIOD

Admissions here at the University are unfair PERIOD Tons of deserving high schoolers are cast aside annually in the quest for diversity  a word that means nothing other than a fair distribution of races. since fairness doesnt really exist diversitys weight in an academic community should be minimized and relegated to an ideal that if achieved naturally the U can award itself a pat on the back but it is nothing to strive for PERIOD

Yes diversity is nothing to strive for PERIOD

This petulant naive quest for diversity allows the University to admit students who are less qualified than others giving the admitted the benefit of the doubt because they are underprivileged underrepresented or the University is getting paid underthetable to take Daddys junior into her flabby diversitygrubbing arms PERIOD

It isnt fair that Desmond will be the third University of Michigan man to come out of his lineage PERIOD But in the same respect it isnt fair that Jack comes from a poor school system and is an underrepresented minority  hes bright pink in case you were wondering his skin color PERIOD My space my rules PERIOD

Neither of these two should see the inside of this campus unless they are taking a virtual tour online or fit the academic standards a top tier University like this one should maintain PERIOD And maintain it uncompromisingly PERIOD

I suppose that would mean continuing to stress grades extracurricular activities and of course standardized tests PERIOD

But Luke you whine from my left standardized tests arent fair they are biased toward the white male. spare me I have no sympathy or tolerance for the unfairness trials or hardships you are overcoming overcame or will overcome in your life PERIOD Fairness doesnt exist and everyone gets their fair share of crap dumped on them PERIOD

Should I pity Lyle and feel bad for him because his genes dictated that he would be bald by age  Is his baldness and my full head of hair fair Is it right that Bertha less resembles a person and more a cage ball because of her genes Genes are as predisposed and controllable as the situation each and everyone comes from PERIOD I can no more control my skin color than you can your economic status PERIOD I cant control my intellect any more than you can control what your father does or doesnt do for a living PERIOD

We arent all born at ground zero PERIOD There is not a shred of equality among us so stop trying to create it PERIOD Does anyone look around their Stats  class and think to themselves Wow all of us in this room are like totally equal. no PERIOD So stop kidding yourself PERIOD

Thats the point PERIOD There are people lesser than you and people greater than you PERIOD This reality reaches far at both ends of the spectrum but for some reason we try to coddle everyones feelings level the playing field and let life run an altered course on terrain designed to be fair to everyone PERIOD

Come on PERIOD Our differences as individuals are what create this broad scope of humanity PERIOD Its so ironic that the very individuality people seek to champion is the same individuality that aids in the defeat of the bankrupt idea of fairness and equality PERIOD Fairness does not exist PERIOD Creating an environment or community or university built under the guise of fairness is naive PERIOD It will not happen PERIOD It is not even an ideal worth pursuing especially not through the employment of superficial guidelines and rubrics for admissions into college PERIOD

Is everyone so afraid of what the University would look like if an application were simply name address essays transcripts and some test scores Is everyone even afraid Or just those who know theyve taken someones place who would deserve their spot under the above criteria PERIOD

Life isnt fair PERIOD Are you here because someone else isnt
