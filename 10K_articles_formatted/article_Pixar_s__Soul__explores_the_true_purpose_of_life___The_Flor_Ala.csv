Eleven years after Disney released Princess and the Frog which had its first black princess Pixar finally produces a movie with its very own black lead called Soul. soul made its debut on the Disney platform on Dec PERIOD  gifting its viewers with an inside perspective on AfricanAmerican culture music and the true meaning of life PERIOD The film tells the story of Joe Gardner a parttime middle school band teacher and a lover of jazz who believes that he was born to play the piano PERIOD

Ever since his father took him to a jazz club when he was younger Joe has always dreamed of being a successful jazz musician PERIOD So when he gets a phone call from a former student offering him the opportunity to perform with Dorothea Williams a lead saxophonist in The Dorothea Williams Quartet he immediately accepts PERIOD That very same day Joe rushes over to audition PERIOD It isnt until after he scores the gig that his life takes a major drop PERIOD

After Joe falls to his death in the sewer viewers see him in a holding pattern as a blue figure sporting only his signature tophat and glasses PERIOD Joe discovers that he is supposed to be heading towards the Great Beyond but instead unprepared to say farewell to his life finds himself plummeting into the Great Before PERIOD In this Great Before Joe realizes that his only way back to Earth is to mentor a new soul help them get their Earth patch and to use this patch to get back down to his body PERIOD

By luck Joe is assigned  one of the most difficult souls to ever attend the Youth Seminar PERIOD Twentytwo has been mentored by Mother Theresa Abraham Lincoln and even Muhammad Ali but has yet to ever achieve an Earth patch  until now PERIOD With the help of Mystics Joe and  who accidentally gets pulled along make it back to Earth  in the wrong bodies PERIOD From here the film guides its viewers into Joes journey back into his rightful body so that he is able to fulfill his lifelong dream PERIOD

Soul touches on life from almost every angle  from 22s a troubled soul who hasnt quite found their niche yet from Connies a middle schooler who is discouraged from playing the trombone from Joes moms a widower who only wants the best for her son from Dezs a barber whose dream of becoming a veterinarian was altered after the birth of his baby girl PERIOD

However I believe the biggest takeaway came from Joes persistent attempt to prove that his sole purpose for living was music PERIOD In his lust for jazz he forgets to enjoy the simplicity of life PERIOD He is at a point where he believes that things like skywatching and walking are just regular old living. it isnt until after he performs with Dorothea Williams and the two musicians are saying their goodbyes that he realizes that it was not what he was expecting PERIOD

Ive been waiting on this day for my entire life Joe says in disbelief I thought it would feel different. i heard this story about this fish Dorothea says He swims up to an old fish and says Im trying to find this thing they call the ocean. the ocean says the older fish PERIOD Thats what youre in right now. this says the young fish PERIOD This is water PERIOD What I want is the ocean. for a while I pondered Dorotheas words PERIOD Why would she leave Joe with this vague metaphor Why didnt she just tell him that maybe music wasnt what hes been chasing after all Continuously throughout the movie people are trying to tell and to show Joe that humans arent born to fit a role  they arent born to be a barber a musician a tailor a teacher  theyre born to live PERIOD And perhaps like a sheet of music Dorothea leaves her words for Joe to read inbetween the lines PERIOD

I feel like she was trying to explain to him that no matter what we do what we dream if we are not satisfied with our life we are always going to yearn for more PERIOD Even if we obtain this dream we are not going to feel fulfilled by it PERIOD

It is not until the end of the movie that Joe makes a commitment to live every minute of his life PERIOD

How many of us watched Soul  and maybe we didnt necessarily agree with their take on lifeafterdeath approach  but related to Joes apathy about living How many of us are too caught in our career in our dreams that we miss out on the small things There are too many of us who are roaming throughout life with blinders on too many of us on autopilot too many of us not living our lives to the fullest PERIOD

After watching Soul for a third time I truly believe that it has motivated me to get out of The Zone and back into my life PERIOD This is why I would rate this movie  out of  stars PERIOD
