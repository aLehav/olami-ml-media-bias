The UT College Republicans are trying to bring wellknown political speakers to the university according to Paul Boyd club vice chairman PERIOD

 Boyd said at the groups first meeting of the semester Wednesday PERIOD Whenever he feels he has time to come and speak we are hoping to set up a convenient time PERIOD State Senator Tim Burchett is also a definite possibility.We invite the entire community to come out and join us in our meetings every other Thursday nightWe basically just want to get together to talk about what political issues are currently going on and how we feel about them.Last semester we focused primarily on campaign issuesThis semester we will be more dedicated to bringing the club together with social events and guest speakers PERIOD We also plan on supporting the faithbased initiative program by doing various community service projects.Were going to be publicly commenting a great deal on campus political topics and both state and national political issuesOur first goal is to show the campus our views on the Iraq situation and why we feel the way we do. log In
