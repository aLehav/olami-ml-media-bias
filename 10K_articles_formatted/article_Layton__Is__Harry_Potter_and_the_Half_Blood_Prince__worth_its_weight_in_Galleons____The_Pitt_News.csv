There might be no greater crime against fans of a beloved literary series than making a movie adaptation that does not stay faithful to the source material PERIOD

Even more heinous to Harry Potter fans however might be having a film adaptation made without a hint of magic thats  prepare yourself  dreadfully dull PERIOD

Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince the sixth book and film in the series never stuck out as a particularly filmable book PERIOD There is too much penultimate exposition leading up to the epic seventh book with the bulk of the action occurring during the majestic Battle for Hogwarts in the books finale PERIOD

The movie is no different PERIOD

There is no cohesive plot to discuss  rather the film feels like a series of only loosely connected events leading up to the heartwrenching ending over which fans will be sure to shed many a tear PERIOD This presents a challenge for director David Yates who translated the plotheavy fifth book on screen two years ago PERIOD

For his second attempt at a Harry Potter flick Yates succeeds in making a sumptuously shot pleasantly wellacted and artfully designed film PERIOD

What he fails at however is establishing any sense of pacing but Yates is not completely to blame PERIOD

Steve Kloves script dwells so much on the adolescent horniness that plagues the book and then as if he and Yates collaboratively realized the severely sagging middle section of the film they add a scene that is almost completely taken from their own imaginations PERIOD

The scene is perfunctory perhaps even appropriate but then Kloves really drops the ball with the ending PERIOD

What was a tense heartpounding series of events in the book complete with an outstanding battle scene with the halls of Hogwarts crumbling around the beloved characters has been  without spoiling anything  significantly altered PERIOD

This might be a mere cry of outrage from a diehard Harry Potter fanatic but from a narrative standpoint so many glossedover subplots simplified explanations and blatant logical omissions make it hard to imagine that someone who hasnt read the book would have a full grasp of whats happening let alone become engrossed in the story PERIOD

Glaring omissions aside the actors we have all come to know and love tackle the influx of teenage hormones with grace and even in scenes played for cheap overthetop laughs they never dip into tacky The CW program territory PERIOD All of the talk and snogging grow wearisome fairly quickly though PERIOD

And though it might be a product of my own mind influenced by the announcement of Dumbledores homosexuality I am pretty sure I noticed a subtle increase of flippant flamboyancy to Michael Gambons take on the role PERIOD

Ultimately HalfBlood Prince is not a bad film  just a very disappointing one PERIOD

I was outraged to see the surely unnecessary changes and when the movie ended it not only made me simultaneously excited and wary for the seventh book adaptations  a twopart film  but it made me wish

Yates had taken more time on this installment PERIOD

If only he had created a worthy HalfBlood Prince instead of a halfboiled snoozefest PERIOD
