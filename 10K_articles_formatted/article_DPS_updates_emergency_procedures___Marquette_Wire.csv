3200,2023-11-04,"every year the Department of Public Safety reviews Marquettes Emergency Procedures Guide PERIOD This year the university made a few small changes PERIOD

Changes are made to the guide in conjunction with revisions to university policy PERIOD

We look at it yearly to see if there is anything we need to update DPS Cpt PERIOD Russell Shaw said PERIOD That doesnt necessarily mean that changes will be made but it is something that we are always cognizant of PERIOD If in fact anything nationally comes out that could make the procedure better we will always be looking at that. the Emergency Procedures Guide covers a large variety of possible happenings on campus including procedures for severe weather conditions active shooters damage to a buildings a gas leaks fires and utility failures PERIOD

It is for all emergencytype procedures Shaw said PERIOD Most of the procedures have been in place it was just a matter of certain verbiage we might have changed to make it a little bit easier for reading purposes. once of the main reasons Marquette makes revisions is to stay in line with national protocol PERIOD For example the university updated the Event and Emergency Management Plan last summer to align better with the National Incident Management System PERIOD

Many of the changes in the Emergency Procedures Guide were to make sure the language is consistent in both publications Lt PERIOD Paul Mascari said PERIOD Nothing has changed in terms of Public Safetys response to an emergency situation. when DPS looks at the policy every year it doesnt always make changes PERIOD However they are made in accordance with changing policies around campus as well as specific emergency procedures that may need addressing PERIOD

The safety and security of our students is our highest priority so the Emergency Procedures Guide is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as needed Mascari said PERIOD We encourage people to use the guide to make plans for possible scenarios they might encounter during an emergency and to regularly reference it when assessing their readiness. dPS works with other groups on campus that may have an opinion on safety procedures PERIOD The review of the Emergency Procedure Guide usually takes two weeks although it can take longer depending on editing and printing PERIOD

Molly Jurich a freshman in the College of Education said she supports the review of Marquettes emergency procedures PERIOD

I think changes to the guide should be made when these occurrences happen at other schools Jurich said PERIOD When universities handle situations effectively their example should be something for Marquette or another school to follow PERIOD Basically the changes should be made when procedure has proven itself to be effective. the Emergency Procedure Guide is available on Marquettes website PERIOD
