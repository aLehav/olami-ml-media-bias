Michigan goaltender Steve Racine played impeccably for the first  minutes of the Michigan hockey teams seriesopening tussle with Notre Dame on Thursday night PERIOD

But he couldnt recover in time to prevent a wraparound Fighting Irish goal with five minutes to go in the game and Michigan dropped game one of the series  at Yost Ice Arena PERIOD

I thought Racine played really well said senior captain A.J PERIOD Treais PERIOD I thought he played one of his best games at Michigan PERIOD  Its too bad we couldnt help him out. michigan set the tempo early in the first period creating a couple of gradeA scoring opportunities PERIOD Just over three minutes into the game freshman defenseman Jacob Trouba narrowly missed giving the Wolverines a  lead when he clanged a wrister off the post from the bottom of the left circle PERIOD

Ninety seconds later though another freshman connected for Michigan PERIOD Justin Selman forechecking hard in the Notre Dame zone with fellow freshman Andrew Copp intercepted an illadvised Fighting Irish pass PERIOD Notre Dame goaltender Steven Summerhays who had allowed just . goals per game this season entering the game guessed wrong and Selman found an upper corner to give the Wolverines the lead PERIOD

I thought we forechecked better said Michigan coach Red Berenson PERIOD We got pucks behind their defense PERIOD We had our legs and we had more confidence PERIOD As the game wore on we wore more on our heels. racine played a terrific period turning away every shot he faced even when the defense was caught out of position an alarming trend that has been amplified recently PERIOD

Though Selman missed a couple of rebound opportunities for a second goal of the night the period ended with the Wolverines ahead  after outplaying the Fighting Irish for the full  minutes PERIOD

Early in the second period though a dreadful Michigan power play allowed Notre Dame to even the score PERIOD

After Austin Wuthrich went to the box for tripping Racine the Wolverines began a twominute man advantage that turned out to be their worst span of the period PERIOD The power play saw only one shot reach the net and the tides turned when T.J PERIOD Tynan sent a pass up ice to Mike Voran who netted a shorthanded goal for the Irish to knot the game at one PERIOD

I think that shorthanded goal in the second period really turned the game in the other direction Berenson said PERIOD When you get your powerplay guys out there and they get scored on thats a huge goal for a road team and they took advantage of it. three minutes later at the  mark of the second period Michigan was awarded another power play which was almost as disappointing PERIOD Again only one shot reached Summerhays and the Fighting Irish had a couple near misses of their own despite being a man short PERIOD

Michigan began the decisive third period on a 4on3 disadvantage which was promptly killed off  one of the lone specialteams bright spots for the Wolverines all night PERIOD

With  to play in the game Treais the NCAA goals leader had a breakaway on Summerhays but his shot was high of the net PERIOD Minutes later sophomore forward Alex Guptill ricocheted a shot off the crossbar PERIOD

Michigan would get no more quality chances in game PERIOD

The gamewinning goal finally came for the Fighting Irish with just over five minutes to play as Racine way out of position couldnt catch up to Notre Dames Bryan Rust  brother of former Michigan player Matt Rust  on a wraparound PERIOD Berenson described the tally as coming off of sloppy play in the Wolverines own end PERIOD

Your goalie keeps you in the game and is playing really well and then the wraparound goal is a tough goal Berenson said PERIOD

An own goal off the skate of sophomore defenseman Mike Chiasson sealed the  win for Notre Dame PERIOD

Despite surrendering the eventual gamewinner late Racine bailed out the defense several times Thursday saving  of  shots faced PERIOD

Michigan and Notre Dame conclude their twogame set Friday night at Yost with a  p.m PERIOD puck drop PERIOD

Every game is a must win now Berenson said of his team which dipped below . for the first time since Dec PERIOD  of last year PERIOD These are huge home games for us. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
