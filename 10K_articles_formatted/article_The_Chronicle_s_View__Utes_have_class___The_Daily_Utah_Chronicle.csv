396,2023-10-23,"saturdays victory over the Team Down South was rewarding on several levelswere going to a BCS bowl were undefeated on the season and we spanked a muchhated rival PERIOD
But perhaps one of the most rewarding parts of beating BYU came after the game PERIOD While U fans swarmed the fields and tore down the goal posts no one threw punches no one kicked each other and the fans allowed all of the BYU players to wallow in their own misery in one piece PERIOD
The players were in one piece because the U team played a classy game PERIOD The same can be said for BYU PERIOD Even though the BYUUtah rivalry is one of the biggest and most hatefilled in the nation players from both sides stayed professional and finished tackling each other once the officials whistles blew PERIOD
Its too bad that the same cant be said for other matchups in the country PERIOD 
The Clemson vs PERIOD South Carolina game became so heated that state troopers had to flood the field and restrain  college football players from killing each other and play was delayed for more than nine minutes PERIOD 
The violence wasnt limited to college either PERIOD At the Indiana PacersDetroit Pistons NBA basketball game players from the Pacers jumped into the stands and began beating up fans PERIOD
This misbehavior only made the Utes and Cougars look that much classier and it made the victory over the Team Down South even sweeter PERIOD
The Utes knew that if they began fighting NCAA rules would require suspensions and no one wanted to miss out on a bowl PERIOD But it took a lot of selfcontrol to keep the game clean and they should be commended for doing so PERIOD The fans deserve the same thanks for having a great time and cheering their hearts out for their favorite team without losing control PERIOD
Now the Utes wont be known only as the team that busted the BCS but the one that did so with grace and style PERIOD
Go Utes
