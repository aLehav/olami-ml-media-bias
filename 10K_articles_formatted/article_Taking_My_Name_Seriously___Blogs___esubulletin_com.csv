A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I often assume a persona when I am gathering myself to go into new situations PERIOD I think today I am going to be Robin Williams in The Dead Poets Society as I enter into the high school classroom and meet the students I will be teaching for a semester PERIOD Or Julia Roberts character in Mona Lisa Smiles PERIOD This removes fear or other hindering emotions PERIOD I dont have to worry about what those high schoolers will think of Ms PERIOD Rozell because I am Mr PERIOD Keating PERIOD

I dont have to make decisions based on what Ms PERIOD Rozell would do because I am Katherine Watson PERIOD The Academy thought she must be correct and gave her an Golden Globe for it If I am to be her than I am to be correct as well PERIOD

When I boarded the plane to Austria to spend the year dancing around and pretending I could speak German I wasnt Josie PERIOD I was Indiana Jones and Charlotte Eriksson and Jack Kerouac PERIOD Searching for adventure living like a vagabond roaming and discovering truth PERIOD

When I began running the cancelled LOViT  mile race I wasnt Josie PERIOD I was Diana Nyad setting out on an impossible endurance adventure looking forward to beating the odds PERIOD I was Rich Roll plantbased athlete ready to prove to myself I was capable of more PERIOD I was stoic Seneca putting perspective on emotion and chasing the obstacle PERIOD

When I got on the plane bound for Jakarta Indonesia I wasnt Josie PERIOD I was Tarzan of the Apes ready to be unleashed from a comfortable life in favor of the jungle of unknowns PERIOD

But as I sit in my little Indonesian cave of wonders with a cup of coffee and the peels of an orange next to me awake and ready to start the day at  a.m. ready to meet the middle school Indonesian students I will be teaching for two months ready to see what my future will hold I realize that Im not Mr PERIOD Keating PERIOD Or Indiana Jones PERIOD Or Diana Nyad PERIOD Or Tarzan PERIOD

And its terrifying PERIOD

Because Josie feels things PERIOD Like failure PERIOD Like embarrassment PERIOD Like anxiety PERIOD And when there is no shield of persona to crouch behind these things sting PERIOD But  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD I also find that I am ready to not be these heroes of mine PERIOD

I am beginning to take my own name seriously PERIOD

Zeno said this. and what have you said writes Seneca in Letters from a Stoic PERIOD Cleanthes said that PERIOD And what have you said How much longer are you going to serve under others orders Assume authority yourself and utter something that may be handed down to posterity  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD no new findings will ever be made if we rest content with the findings of the past. perhaps that is what knowing thyself is releasing the soul from the cage of heroes you have put around it in the name of protection PERIOD

The men who pioneered the old roads are leaders not our masters  PERIOD

Without these personas I feel like an imposter PERIOD A fraud PERIOD Laughable irony because that is what I am being when I pretend to be other than Josie PERIOD I find myself thinking when I embody my own name who am I to be acting thusly Who am I to say these things that I do What authority has been given to me that I can speak

But I am only limited by what I dont believe I have the right to say PERIOD

I sit here crosslegged in my Indonesian cave of wonders mug of coffee to my right and the waft of orange peels dancing around me PERIOD Listening to the pounding tropical rain on the clay tiled roof PERIOD Waiting PERIOD Waiting for the clock to turn  a.m PERIOD so I can go to the international school PERIOD Waiting to see who it is I will be teaching PERIOD Waiting to see what my future will be PERIOD

This path is unpaved for me PERIOD There is no persona to assume PERIOD There is no one who is going to do the work for me PERIOD

So I must begin to take my own name seriously PERIOD
