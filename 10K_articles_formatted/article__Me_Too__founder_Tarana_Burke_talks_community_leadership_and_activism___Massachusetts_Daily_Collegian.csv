Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke said that two years ago she couldnt book a speaking engagement Wednesday night almost  seats in John M PERIOD Greene Hall were filled listening to the famous activist talk about the importance of leadership PERIOD

For the past two years Burke has been traveling around the world talking about the misconceptions about the Me Too movement a survivorbuilt and survivorled social justice movement to end sexual violence PERIOD

Burke stated one reason she established the movement because people dont understand what a survivor looks like. thats why people say she cant be a survivor she doesnt act like one Burke said PERIOD

The other is that the Me Too movement and the MeToo movement are the same PERIOD

First according to Burke MeToo doesnt recognize Black queer bodies  only white ablebodied beautiful celebrities. as a result it took  years of exposs social media posts and documentaries for R PERIOD Kelly to be indicted but only two articles to take Harvey Weinstein down. nonetheless Burke stated that she started the Me Too movement to center Black women and Black girls PERIOD

And I do that unapologetically Burke said PERIOD

Burke credits her activism to her upbringing in the Bronx PERIOD

People need to know that extraordinary people come from ordinary places she said PERIOD

Raised by a panAfrican grandfather and a mother who wrapped her in Black feminist literature Burke was exposed to books like Before the Mayflower and writers like Ntozake Shange PERIOD

Although growing up in an activist household helped her identify injustice Burke said that it didnt give her the tools to fight it. it was when she joined the twenty-first Century Youth Leadership Movement where she found the tools and the moment to be a leader PERIOD

And it changed the trajectory of my life Burke said PERIOD

The organization one of the oldest youth leadership organizations in the country was founded back in  by veterans of the civil rights movement and many social justice movements of the 60s and 70s PERIOD According to the organizations website its mission is to inspire assist organize and develop young people of all ages in and out of school to be skilled community focused leaders. its mission is to inspire assist organize and develop young people of all ages in and out of school to be skilled community focused leaders PERIOD

Burke said that during her time at the organization every morning she said to herself I am a leader what shall I give

To Burke a leader gives time resources and a voice PERIOD Donating your time means looking for the gaps in your community where there are little resources and joining others in doing similar work around your interest PERIOD

People did not really care about sexual violence until two years ago she said PERIOD And a lot of them still dont care now so that means in your community there is probably some underresourced understaffed organization that is holding all these people in your community that is probably saying Me Too. go volunteer there PERIOD Give them some of your time Burke added PERIOD

According to Burke there havent been a lot of resources that have spread through the ground the ground meaning grassroots organizations which have left a lot of meaningful organizations that could help in financial worry PERIOD

For reference Burke cites that the National Sexual Assault Hotline had a  percent increase last year and a  percent intake rise PERIOD The need for resources is urgent she claims which means that involving yourself in fundraisers and donating money to organizations is crucial PERIOD

It takes resources to build a community. lastly a voice  Burke emphasized that although they can galvanize a movement hashtags are not movements. instead she advised the audience to speak out when they hear hateful words  as long as it does not put them in danger  and to not squander this moment. build while you climb be a lifelong learner and dont be afraid of making mistakes Burke said PERIOD

She also advocated for working together toward a goal because its less hard to be done in a community. and thats what we are an international community Burke added PERIOD Work is hard but it is less hard when done as a community. to Burke community is a preference over the government one she claims we cannot trust to create tangible change for the rights of survivors PERIOD

One of the biggest lessons Burke learned in understanding how deep the country was into the sexual assault epidemic was in Selma Alabama PERIOD

When Burke did a sexual violence education program in the Selma Junior High School in the late 1990s she had all the children write down their knowledge about sexual violence on sticky notes PERIOD If they had experienced sexual violence themselves they were encouraged to write Me too. burke said that she saw those two words on sticky after sticky. according to Burke  percent of the girls in the middle school at the time were survivors of sexual violence PERIOD The number shocked her PERIOD

These are the same children that if a police officer touched a hair on their head we would shut this city down Burke said PERIOD

After recounting this experience Burke emphasized to the audience the need for communities to work together PERIOD

If we have a community problem we need a community solution. the other time Burke saw this was through the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings PERIOD Through the people that she met Burke was able to realize how deeply personal the hearings were to many survivors many who she described to be sad and broken after his confirmation PERIOD

Each night after the confirmation Burke would read comments and emails about Dr PERIOD Christine Blasey Ford that would categorize Ford and feminists in offensive manners PERIOD It was that moment where Burke realized that part of the problem around sexual violence is that not only is it pervasive and normalized but that people do not understand what survival looks like PERIOD

We use the word and throw it out people were saying things like you know she has to be lying because she doesnt know the details or this is ridiculous why are you bringing up this 30yearold case

Burke began to understand that she lives in a bubble a space where everyone agrees with and does the same work as her PERIOD In that moment she realized the importance to teach others what a sexual survivor looks like PERIOD

The notion that a sexual survivor will be able to recall each and every detail in their account is not a universal experience PERIOD Referencing her own life Burke states that she has companions who are angered at her for not being able to recall simple facts due to her poor memory PERIOD

And my memory is terrible because I have spent most of my life trying to forget Burke said PERIOD

She added that when people hear narratives around who got Me Tood and describe the movement in bits and pieces of the spectrum of sexual violence it shows a lack of understanding about what Me Too is about she says PERIOD

To Burke Me Too is about learning and talking about a culture that creates an atmosphere around sexual violence from language to people who fear walking outside of their own homes PERIOD

However Burke also emphasized the importance of joy in emotionallytaxing work PERIOD

Although she has days where all I can do is survive Burke said that she heals her soul not only through therapy but also through little things such as memories of her child running over to her at daycare PERIOD

Like activism curating joy is about intentionality Burke said PERIOD

Burke closed the event by encouraging the audience to talk about the movement differently PERIOD

One of our biggest challenges is when people dont understand Burke said PERIOD They feel threated they feel like its too much or they feel like its been going on too long. akilah Williams a Smith College student said that she couldnt put this event into words PERIOD

Im kind of shook Williams said PERIOD She resonates such amazing energy. smith College student Brittany Torres said that hearing Burke makes me feel like yeah I can fing do this. the event was organized by the Smith College Wertele Center for Leadership PERIOD
