Stephanie Hushcha a freshman in theCollege of Arts  Sciences said With every NBA alum who came out I just kept screaming louder and louder  I can only begin to imagine what the first game will be like. it featured special guests like Steve Novak Wesley Mathews Jimmy Butler Dwayne Wade and Lazar Hayward who currently play in the NBA as well as competitions between students and players PERIOD Fans lined up from the front doors at the Al McGuire Center around the corner to Carpenter Tower on Fri. Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Lauren Broniarczyk a freshman in the College of Health Sciences said she enjoyed the event PERIOD

It was amazing PERIOD There is no better feeling than singing your heart out to Ring Out Ahoya and then yelling WE ARE MARQUETTE along side your best friends Broniarczyk said PERIOD Seeing Buzz Williams and Junior Cadougan singing  PRICELESS. marquette Madness has been going on for over ten years and used to be called Midnight Madness but because families like to attend coordinators thought it would be better to have the event start at  p.m rather than midnight PERIOD
