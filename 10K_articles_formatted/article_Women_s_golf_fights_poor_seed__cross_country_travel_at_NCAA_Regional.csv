5404,2014-05-08,"coming off the programs biggest win in recent memory the No PERIOD  Stanford womens golf team will look to avoid a letdown and continue its championshiplevel play at this weekends NCAA East Regional PERIOD Despite winning the ultracompetitive Pac12 Tournament  an event that featured six of the countrys top  squads  the Cardinal received the No PERIOD  seed in the East Regional which will be played on the Southwood Golf Course in Tallahassee Florida PERIOD

While Anne Walkers unit is certainly happy about advancing to the NCAA preliminary round its seeding and regional placement were somewhat of a headscratcher PERIOD The No PERIOD  slot which indicates that the NCAA committee ranked Stanford as the ninth best team in the country seemingly discounts the Cards truly historic victory on at Trysting Tree a few weeks ago PERIOD It also does not align with GolfWeeks collegiate rankings which pegs the Cardinal as No PERIOD  in the nation PERIOD

In addition Stanford is one of only two Pacific time zone squads in the 24team field meaning it will likely have a full day of travel before the wheels touch down in Florida PERIOD But despite the seemingly raw deal it received in its regional assignment the group seems to have put all distractions out of sight in their march towards a national title PERIOD

We werent thrilled with our draw in the East Region Walker said PERIOD Getting to Tallahassee involves a lot of travel and obviously a quick time adjustment especially given our early tee times for day one and day two PERIOD The other big factor at play is the Bermuda grass that we will face PERIOD It calls for a different kind of shot and strategy one that we dont have the opportunity to practice PERIOD With that being said however I know we will quickly adjust and make good decisions come game time PERIOD

No matter what region you go to you have to play well and that will be our focus she added PERIOD

After placing fifth in the West Regional last season on their home course the Cardinal are aiming to be even more competitive at this seasons regional event PERIOD But it will be a tough test in Tallahassee with Stanford facing a field that counts five top15 teams including No PERIOD  and reigning ACC champion Duke PERIOD The two have faced each other three times in tournament play this season with the Blue Devils beating the Cardinal all three times by a combined  strokes PERIOD Duke which has to be considered the favorite in the field will be led by Celine Boutier and Laetitia Beck both of whom are ranked amongst the worlds top  female amateurs PERIOD

No PERIOD  South Carolina which received the regionals second seed enters with an atlarge bid from the SEC a conference that was won by No PERIOD  Vanderbilt PERIOD The Commodores are the fourth seed in the East Regional with No PERIOD  Pepperdine  the champions of the West Coast Conference  rounding out the top five teams in Tallahassee PERIOD Eight squads plus two individuals will advance to the NCAA Championships from each of the three regionals meaning that if Stanford plays even close to its best the quintet wont have a difficult time moving on to Tulsa PERIOD

We have a great opportunity to qualify for the finals Walker remarked PERIOD We have a strong team from one to five with senior leadership steady players and also players who can go low PERIOD That always makes for a competitive team. walker will return three out of her five players from the  regional team with Sally Watson graduated and current senior Danielle Frasier not likely to play PERIOD Those two will likely be replaced by freshman Casey Danielson and senior Marissa Mar PERIOD Danielsons improving play during the spring season has been a godsend for the Card which needed a potent third scorer behind sophomores Mariah Stackhouse and Lauren Kim after Mariko Tumangan began to struggle PERIOD

Nevertheless Tumangan was the only Stanford golfer to finish in the individual top  at last seasons regional event with Stackhouse and Kim also placing in the top  PERIOD But Watson was the next Cardinal player at T65 which showed a lack of depth that didnt allow the unit to be very competitive at the NCAA Championships PERIOD Stanford is already well on the way to addressing that issue evidenced by the fact that four of its five players finished in the top  at the Pac12 tourney PERIOD If the unit can replicate that performance at the regional event and beyond it will have an excellent chance of bringing home hardware PERIOD

We know our stats show that when we get the ball upanddown  percent of the time we can compete with any team in the country Walker said PERIOD That goes for every individual too Every player in our lineup can score when they play with a level head and make good decisions. play at the 72hole NCAA East Regional will begin today with the event wrapping up on Saturday PERIOD If the Cardinal or one of their individuals advances there will be ten days off before the NCAA Championships in Tulsa Oklahoma PERIOD
