Editors note This letter is a response to the previous article UI Dining Services uses local sustainable sources published in the Dec PERIOD   edition of The Daily Illini PERIOD

I think its great that the University of Illinois has gone trayless begun to recycle glass and divert leftovers in new ways PERIOD

It is crucial however that campuses nationwide adopt better purchasing practices in a standardized way which is what Real Food Challenge aims to achieve by  PERIOD Real Food Challenge is a studentled movement that strives to create a healthy fair and green food system on college campuses PERIOD

Heres why I think signing the Real Food Campus Commitment is both a critical step and an attainable objective for the University of Illinois PERIOD

RFCs calculator tool is studentrun which increases student knowledge about these issues and presents opportunities for connections between students and producers PERIOD Student investigation holds dining service providers accountable for their promotional claims and affirms the role of young people as decision makers within our food system PERIOD



The calculator is versatile in its adaptation to the unique situations of different university campuses but operates using the same rigorous measurement standards PERIOD For instance some students volunteer to operate the calculator some obtain academic credit and others are paid by their campus dining program PERIOD

When assessing local purchasing the calculator evaluates each of the individual ingredients which represents a more rigorous analysis of food products PERIOD Furthermore small producers and cooperatives are favored in the analysis even if a CocaCola processing plant was located next to our campus we could not count the product as local. the key to inclusivity is the calculators emphasis on producers that gross only  percent of the industry leader PERIOD It sounds like the University of Illinois would be well on its way to meeting local purchasing criteria using this method PERIOD

Moreover part of RFCs goal is to use institutional support to build the infrastructure necessary to support smallscale local and communitybased food producers who are producing food in sustainable fair and humane ways PERIOD By your institution making a demonstrable commitment to sourcing from such farms you support your local economy in creating demand and supporting these producers PERIOD In Baltimore were seeing positive change resulting from Johns Hopkins Universitys commitment which has supported the creation of an innovative new Baltimore Food Hub nearly doubled the size of a local grassfed beef farm and helped an aquaculture facility take off PERIOD

And were in the middle of a city

Its also important to note that if we all adopt different standards crosscampus comparison becomes impossible and leaves room for greenwashing objective standards are important because they provide an operational definition for words like sustainable. rFCs reasonable goals  percent Real Food by  are based on thirdparty academic reviews and are meant to be attainable anywhere in the nation despite differences in climate and culture PERIOD
