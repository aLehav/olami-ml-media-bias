KAY PRAUNER is a senior newseditorial major the assistant copy desk chief and a Daily Nebraskan columnist PERIOD

This week a student columnist was fired for using a profanity in one of his expositions PERIOD

His editors decision to fire him was lauded by the university and may have even set precedence for media actions across the nation PERIOD

But when Jesse Oxfeld of the Stanford Daily mentioned the  that is Chelsea Clinton and her debut on Stanford Universitys campus he meant no harm PERIOD He merely alluded to the fact that her privacy was equally important as the privacy of other university students when he mentioned two gripes about the Dailys ratheropaque  policy That the rule meant journalists  or in other words dont do their jobs and that both the university and the White House made such an outlandish display of Chelseas arrival  complete with ma pa and hundreds of security officials donning dark glasses and leering suspiciously at every student in sight  that the efforts to ensure her privacy had kept other students from their own privacy PERIOD Oxfelds column included nothing offensive nothing radical nothing harmful nothing libelous nothing unfair PERIOD

Even so Editor in Chief Carolyn Sleeth said Oxfeld was in strict violation of her adamantly enforced  rule and thus violated his duties as a weekly columnist PERIOD

Beneath this rule Chelseas name could be mentioned only if she were involved in what was deemed a  And according to Sleeth Chelseas arrival did not fall under the  category PERIOD So when Oxfeld refused to submit a rewrite he was fired PERIOD

So how far exactly must this policy span In an interview with ABC News Oxfeld said 

Certainly Oxfeld blatantly disregarded his editors instructions but he should have been able to comment on Chelseas arrival for the simple fact that she is  like it or not  a public figure PERIOD

The entourage that surrounded Chelsea on movingin day clearly pointed to her celebrity status and this was exactly Oxfelds point PERIOD No other Stanford student arrived with such flamboyance no other student pulled up with a platoon of body guards PERIOD

Of course Bill and Hillary want their daughter to have as  a college experience as any other young adult PERIOD And Im sure the only child of the most powerful man in the world wants nothing more than to have some shred of normalcy in her life PERIOD Having grown up the governors daughter Chelsea has never been out of the spotlight yet this familiarity would never protect her from the glare PERIOD For even Chelseas deliberation about which university to attend made the evening news for months PERIOD

But what average Stanford student could ignore the fact that a Secret Service agent sits in on Chelseas Composition  or that men in dark glasses perpetually sit within earshot as shes having dinner with friends in the cafeteria

Albeit through no fault of her own when Chelsea arrived she did disrupt the standard students activities on Stanfords campus PERIOD

And similarly through no fault of her own Chelsea is a public figure a status that under any circumstance should permit the media to cover her actions  so long as coverage of public figures remains one of the foremost tenets of the First Amendment PERIOD

As of right now the medias privilege to cover public figures remains and beneath this privilege Jesse Oxfeld should have been allowed to remain as well PERIOD

And as for the Stanford Daily protect Chelseas privacy please but dont allow her presence to pervade the rights of other students or staff  for such actions will detract from their own  university experiences PERIOD
