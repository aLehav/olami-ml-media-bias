For the Student Activities Board running the Drake Relays doesnt involve track spikes PERIOD

Emily Callen a sophomore elementary education major and Ashley Fellows a sophomore marketing and international relations double major head the Relays executive board that consists of students interested in helping with an event PERIOD

Callen said each student is in charge of an SAB Relays event PERIOD The Relays events start with Blitz Day at the beginning of the month and end with a pancake breakfast at the end of Relays week PERIOD

We oversee and approve all the planning starting from brainstorming all the way to execution PERIOD So every little detail you can think of were kind of in charge of figuring it out Callen said PERIOD

Fellows said it is important to look at the small details when planning events PERIOD

We get to see that background and we get to get excited about how students are going to react to it when it happens Fellows said PERIOD We make sure everything is lined up so when it is presented to the students they are really excited about it. secondyear pharmacy student Alissa Tillotson is the SAB band cochair PERIOD She helps choose the bands that come to Drake coordinates with the agent of the band and plans the concert events PERIOD

Tillotson said hiring an artist is a long process that involves a contract to make sure both parties are satisfied PERIOD

Honestly I think its less stressful than I thought it would be if youre organized about it PERIOD If you try to do everything we do over the course of a semester in a week then I think it would be really stressful but we try to be really on top of things and have set office hours to get everything done PERIOD I havent been too stressed out with it ever Tillotson said PERIOD

Callen said keeping all the events a secret is exciting PERIOD

The theme is kept secret PERIOD The band for the Court Avenue concert is kept secret Callen said PERIOD And those are things weve worked really hard on or weve seen our bands cochair on SAB work really hard on so we think it builds suspense and helps get students really excited about Relays PERIOD I kind of like keeping it a secret. the theme for Relays this year is Snapshots of Excellence and the artist for the Court Avenue concert is Hoodie Allen PERIOD Finding an artist for the concert is a challenge every year PERIOD

It takes a while for that process to go through and I know especially with past years too  theres a lot of fluctuation with artists PERIOD Like I know last year they didnt lock down an artist completely until about two weeks before Tillotson said PERIOD

Tillotson said it can be a frustrating process to choose a Court Avenue Concert act PERIOD Often something will fall through at the last second PERIOD

The members of SAB are sure not to forget about the most important part of the Relays the track events PERIOD

Fellows said it is exciting to see the Des Moines community attend the track events PERIOD

We get to kind of show off our school in a sense PERIOD I know a lot of people talked about how were a small school but it feels like a big school during that week because everyone is always moving Fellows said PERIOD

Callen and Fellows are keeping a tally to see who drinks the most coffee during Relays week PERIOD

We will just be overseeing every event PERIOD So we will be at each one for setup during it and tear down and making sure everything runs smoothly  probably handling some last minute crisis that we cant foresee Callen said PERIOD Hopefully well be enjoying ourselves too and being able to look at our hard work and see the benefits of it and see that the students are really enjoying it. jNews  Premium WordPress news  magazine theme by Jegtheme PERIOD
