Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

November  

Before we begin with todays topic let me just try a little experiment

aise your hands if you students professors employees locals etc. have ever smoked marijuana pot cannabis weed ganja herb grass dope etc. pERIOD

Whoa Thats what I thought PERIOD

I guess it shouldnt come as any surprise to you if I tell you to give up any aspirations you might have of doing something wonderful with your life PERIOD

Its too lateyou wrecked it You smoked pot Youre doomed Your mother always said youd never amount to anything and I guess she was right huh

In case it hasnt dawned on you yet Im talking about the latest crusade against the use of marijuana by people like Douglas Ginsburg who mistakenly thought his law degree and years as a Harvard law professor meant anything PERIOD

This weekends papers were splotched with the most ridiculous stories about pot in the U.S PERIOD Lets start with Ginsburghes the guy Reagan nominated to fill Justice Lewis Powells Supreme Court position after Bork was well rejected to put it mildly PERIOD

Ginsburg last week put the knife to his own throat when he admitted smoking pot in college and as a professor PERIOD Right away the outspoken conservatives jumped all over his case and now he has withdrawn PERIOD

Dont get me wrong Im not surprisedjust sort of humorously baffled PERIOD Why is it that I can just picture a bunch of Church Lady politicians getting their jollies out of condemning a man who made the mistake of being honest PERIOD

Why doesnt anyone make a big deal out of alcohol You could go home and get blotto on martinis every night and still be a Supreme Court justice PERIOD But smoke pot and burn in hell I guess PERIOD

By the way Ginsburg also once heard a case in which he had direct interest PERIOD Oh so now hes a druggy and a shyster too PERIOD How dare heto the firing line with that man

All I know is whoever finally gets appointed to fill this seat must be God PERIOD In which case look out if you ever have to be judged by him PERIOD I fear Armageddon PERIOD

Next story in question Tennessee Sen PERIOD Albert Gore Jr. Democratic presidential candidate refused to say whether or not he ever smoked pot in college PERIOD Well isnt that special

e might as well pack it in too PERIOD Of course he did say he hasnt smoked pot in the past  years but that just doesnt matter because the implication here is that the butt of a marijuana cigarette has once touched the lips of Mr PERIOD Gore and that is simply unacceptable in todays spotless society PERIOD

Speaking of our spotless society right next to the story on Gore in Saturdays Milwaukee Sentinel is a story headlined  percent of Americans over age  have tried pot U.S PERIOD figures show. just between you and me I think someones lying PERIOD Come on Twenty seven percent Im willing to bet there are more pot smokers than that in Illinois PERIOD And theyre saying only that many have ever tried pot PERIOD Who are they trying to kid

What is it everyone got bored with politicians and illustrious sex so they had to come up with something new Surely they could have done better than pot usage PERIOD Some of these guys must beat their dogs or something right

Lets face itthe apparent standards that are being set for todays top political candidates are ridiculously inhuman PERIOD Its like asking that the surgeon general be in perfect health PERIOD Now Ive seen that guy and I know its not true PERIOD

So why do other politicians have to be right up there with the cherubs and seraphims to get anywhere Pretty soon there arent going to be any more candidates for anything because no one can possibly meet the standards PERIOD If the worst Ginsburg has done is smoke pot he should be canonized PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Paul Simon DIL made a good point when he said If we look just at the mistakes people make and we all make them  I think we do a disservice to the process. can we just lighten up a bit
