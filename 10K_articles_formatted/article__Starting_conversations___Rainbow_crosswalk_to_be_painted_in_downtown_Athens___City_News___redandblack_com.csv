A Change.org petition created in  to push for a rainbow crosswalk in Athens will be realized this year PERIOD The crosswalk will be painted somewhere downtown PERIOD

When Cameron Harrelson moved to Athens in  Athens PRIDE wasnt a festival PERIOD It was just a picnic tucked away in a park PERIOD In  the Athens PRIDE festival expanded over two blocks downtown with a crowd of thousands of people PERIOD

As Harrelson an Athens resident and vice president of Athens PRIDE walked away from the  festival back in September he thought about how the Athens community could showcase yearround how much the LGTBQ community has grown PERIOD

Thats when the idea to paint a rainbow crosswalk was born PERIOD

I wanted people to know not that the government is accepting people but that we are an accepting people said Harrelson PERIOD I talked with people on the Athens PRIDE board people in my friend group and those in our community that are further marginalized by race and gender identity and we felt a rainbow crosswalk could represent us in a public way. in October  Harrelson created a petition on Change.org for the AthensClarke County government to dedicate a space in the community for a rainbow crosswalk PERIOD

The petition became hugely popular and gained support almost overnight Harrelson said PERIOD Harrelson later wrote an open letter to the ACC Mayor and Commission and garnered support from District  Commissioner Allison Wright PERIOD

Nearly  months and over  petition signatures later on June  the ACC Mayor and Commission approved  in funding to paint the crosswalk at a future time and an undetermined location PERIOD

Wright said the  is coming from the  Transportation Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax PERIOD TSPLOST is a program that was voted on in  by ACC voters to fund  projects related to transportation purposes according to ACCs website PERIOD The money was designated for a community art project but was never used and the crosswalk has been on the commissions radar since the fall Wright said PERIOD

Amid protests against police brutality across the United States some members of the Black community in Athens view the announcement of a rainbow crosswalk as performative and diverting attention away from racerelated issues PERIOD

Rachelle Berry a University of Georgia graduate student activist and member of the LGBTQ and Black communities said they can agree with people who view the crosswalk as performative PERIOD

Todays the day you decide to put up a rainbow Its not that other cities arent doing symbolic things like this Berry said PERIOD But theyre painting Black Lives Matter on their streets and Black Lives Matter in rainbow colors which I dont think Athens is ready for or would ever do. berry said there is discussion circulating the LGBTQ and Black communities that the rainbow crosswalk is going to be painted at the intersection of Broad Street and College Avenue which Berry said would have been so performative and disrespectful considering the fact that ACC police used tear gas on protesters there on May  PERIOD

Even though the exact location of the crosswalk hasnt been determined Wright said the rainbow crosswalk cannot be painted at that intersection because Broad Street is a state highway and ACC doesnt have jurisdiction over it PERIOD The crosswalk will most likely be painted somewhere along Clayton Street Wright said PERIOD

Regardless of the location Berry said they feel like the government is trying to change the conversation and make people forget that they didnt apologize for using tear gas on protesters PERIOD

There are people in the community who know that this is them just trying to whitewash what they did Berry said PERIOD But COVID will end one day and the government will answer for what they did. harrelson and Wright both recognize that the approval of the rainbow crosswalk comes at a bad time PERIOD

Harrelson said the announcement of the rainbow crosswalk is not meant to be a pat on the back for the commission or to change the conversation surrounding police brutality and injustices but rather to start a conversation between the LGBTQ community and the commission PERIOD

On the petition Harrelson called for the rainbow to have inclusive pride flag colors for the transgender Black and Brown communities PERIOD Harrelson said he specifically requested this when he turned in his proposal to the commission PERIOD

The timing is awful for me PERIOD It is awful for this great project that the queer community including queer people of color put together Harrelson said PERIOD This project has been in the works for a long time with queer people of color at the forefront and people of color in mind. harrelson said people have been directing their anger at the crosswalk and he thinks they should instead direct their anger toward those in power who have not changed the system PERIOD

From the onset of the petition Harrelson and supporters of the crosswalk knew it was not the ultimate goal but just the first step in the right direction PERIOD Harrelson said he wishes this step could have been taken sooner so it wouldnt appear to overshadow any other issues at all PERIOD

Its not about painting a sidewalk its about starting conversations about multiple issues facing the LGBTQ community Harrelson said PERIOD I can honestly say that it has been successful in starting conversations from conversations Ive had with commissioners. in addition to the rainbow crosswalk Wright said she has been trying to get approval for an updated broader and more inclusive Athens antidiscrimination ordinance PERIOD

If the mayor signs the ordinance and its in committee thats where the real work gets done Wright said PERIOD But then were not done we have to do a better job of reporting what we have on the books and making sure people know that they can report discrimination too. as June ended and marked the end of this years Pride Month Harrelson said he wants the community to know that the crosswalk marks the beginning to a longer road of change PERIOD

I have urged the commission from day one that the approval of the crosswalk should coincide with the passing of an updated Athens antidiscrimination ordinance Harrelson said PERIOD We cant just stop with symbolic gestures we have to pass real policies that affect our actual lives. the rainbow crosswalk is not a solution to any of the problems facing the LGBTQ or Black community it is just the response to many people wanting to see a public display of pride in Athens Harrelson said PERIOD

I think everyone has the right to be outraged at our local state and federal government PERIOD I understand the frustration and I share it Harrelson said PERIOD With that being said I will celebrate this as a win PERIOD Not because of the committee that brought this to fruition but because of the work of the queer community in Athens. attendees walked under a rainbow balloon arch at the Athens PRIDE Street Festival while cha
