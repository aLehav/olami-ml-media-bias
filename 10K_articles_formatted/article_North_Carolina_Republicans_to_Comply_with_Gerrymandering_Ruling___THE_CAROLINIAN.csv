After a North Carolina legislative map was sent for legal review due to allegations of partisan manipulation courts ruled that the districts drawn corresponded with gerrymandering and that the Republican legislature was therefore in violation of the state constitution PERIOD The maps were thrown out by the court and must be redrawn PERIOD

As of Sept PERIOD  Republicans have expressed that they will comply with the unanimous panel ruling PERIOD They are unlikely to appeal the decision and even if it was appealed the North Carolina Supreme Court would likely uphold the current ruling which is also virtually protected from U.S PERIOD Supreme Court review PERIOD The likelihood that the  election cycle will take place under fair and approved maps is strong but that could spell trouble for the longstanding conservative rule in the state PERIOD

The case referred to as Common Cause v PERIOD Lewis has been widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive judicial opinions written on partisan gerrymandering PERIOD The threejudge panel of the Wake County Superior Court that issued the opinion had an unprecedented admittance to the large quantity of information left by Thomas Hoefeller the gerrymandering expert for the North Carolina GOP PERIOD

Hoefeller is partially responsible for the House and Senate maps in place currently and after his death his daughter released his materials to Common Cause which is the organization that recently sued in an attempt to have the maps struck down PERIOD The materials were provided to the court by Common Cause and were implicated in the ruling that the Republican Party has long been in violation of gerrymandering statutes PERIOD

The legislative maps in place at the moment were drawn in  which was after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the previous maps constituted unlawful racial gerrymandering PERIOD According to the materials provided by Hoefellers daughter Hoefeller was given election data by the Republican Party and instructed to defend their supermajority PERIOD

Through election data analysis he drew a map that divided cities towns and even neighborhoods to create as many reliably GOP districts as possible PERIOD He used the mapping to cram as many Democrats into as few surefire liberal districts as possible then redistributed the remaining Democrats into more heavily conservative districts PERIOD

According to a test conducted in court by trial experts the maps drawn by Hoefeller were more favorable to the Republican Party than . percent of maps generated by an algorithm that used nonpartisan redistricting components PERIOD Hoefeller constructed a partisanship score which indicated the districts maximally favored Republicans and his system managed to preserve the Republican supermajority even when Democrats won the majority of state votes PERIOD

In Rucho v PERIOD Common Cause decided in June  the U.S PERIOD Supreme Court ruled that federal courts could not rule on gerrymandering cases due to the fact that they are beyond the competence of the federal courts. this case virtually suggested that state courts were equipped to provide protections and rulings on partisan gerrymandering based on their states constitutional clauses and that federal courts have no authority to review state court decisions because they do not implicate federallevel legislation PERIOD

The Wake County Superior Court relied on their ability to rule on the statelevel gerrymandering case and the panel comprised of two Democrats and one Republican found that the extreme partisan gerrymandering was in violation of three clauses of the North Carolina State Constitution PERIOD

First the courts opinion stated that the gerrymandering struck at the free elections clause which asserts that elections must be conducted freely and honestly to ascertain fairly and truthfully the will of the people. the court reported that elections are not free when partisan actors have tainted future elections by specifically and systematically designing the contours of the election districts for partisan purposes and a desire to preserve power. second the maps were found in violation of the equal protection clause which is regarded as providing more voting rights protections than its federal counterpart PERIOD Referring to Hoefellers intent to severely dilute the number of Democratic votes the court said that there is nothing equal about the voting power of Democratic voters when they have a vastly less realistic chance of winning a majority in either chamber. third the court found the party in violation of the freedom of speech and expression clause in which voting is referred to as an act of expression PERIOD They noted that voting for the candidate of ones choice and associating with the political party of ones choice are core means of political expression and that banding together with likeminded citizens in a political party is a form of protected association as is expenditure of funds in support of candidates. hoefellers maps were ruled as viewpoint discrimination against Democrats and as burdening their speech by making their votes less effective. court opinion also stated that Hoefeller deliberately minimized the effectiveness of the votes of citizens with whom the Republican Party disagrees. the Wake County Superior Court has given the General Assembly two weeks to draw new maps to be competed at public hearings with any relevant computer screen visible to legislators and public observers. if they are unable to do so the court is able to appoint a specialist to draw satisfactory maps PERIOD

Common Cause v PERIOD Lewis has proven to be a victory for voting rights activists and has illustrated the ease with which courts are able to determine when a violation of voting rights has occurred PERIOD Republican agreement to comply with the ruling makes sense victory should they choose to appeal would be unlikely PERIOD The Sept PERIOD  ruling has increased the likelihood of a more free and fair elections for the  cycle PERIOD
