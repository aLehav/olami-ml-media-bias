9453,1970-01-01,"some time ago I was introduced to Clipper City Brewing Company and this week I decided to grab one of their beers to try PERIOD I ended up by accident with their Weizen Doppelbock PERIOD Even though its not the normal time of year I have a bit of a soft spot for wheat beers so Im not exactly annoyed but I should have checked the bottle more closely since Clipper City has some good IPAs PERIOD

Hugh Sisson established Clipper City Brewing Company in  PERIOD Sisson helped start Marylands first brewpub Sissons with his family before branching off with Ernesto Igot of the San Miguel Brewery in the Philippines PERIOD The brewery now markets all its beers under the Heavy Seas name and groups its brews into related families called Fleets PERIOD Three Fleets are currently on the market Clipper Fleet Pyrate Fleet and Mutiny Fleet PERIOD

Clipper Fleet consists of classic beer styles under  percent with an eye towards drinkability and overall quality PERIOD Pyrate Fleet contains their bottle conditioned beers each between  and  percent ABV which are more complex and pack more of a punch than the Clipper Fleet PERIOD Mutiny Fleet has the hightest beers all over  percent ABV all bottle conditioned and many of them are designed for aging PERIOD The Weizen Doppelbock named Hang Ten fits comfortably in this last category at  percent ABV making it a fairly big example of the style PERIOD

The beer poured a hazy dark brown despite which a backlight revealed a ruby color fading to a honey gold at the edges PERIOD The head formed as one finger of coarse light tan foam which quickly dissipated to a thin ring of light white bubbles around the rim of the glass PERIOD The aroma was a very muddled combination typical of wheat beers with lots of banana esters up front backed up by clove and yeast PERIOD I did note however a bit of hot alcohol in the aroma which is not exactly desirable PERIOD The carbonation was moderately high although it did little besides provide a sparkling highlight to the fairly thick body of this beer PERIOD

The body was not as thick as some barleywines Ive had but its quite substantial as would be expected from this style PERIOD The taste was fairly sweet and malty with a fair bit of yeast but the sweetness didnt linger terribly far in the aftertaste PERIOD Some dark fruits hung in the background especially plum but they definitely took a back seat in this beer PERIOD The bit that threw me was the aftertaste which featured a surprising combination of yeastiness and solventy hot alcohols PERIOD I didnt really enjoy that which is unfortunate given how good the rest of the beer is PERIOD

Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer PERIOD I actually think its a very good candidate for aging as it has enough alcohol to preserve it and the aging process will help reduce the hot alcohols PERIOD This is not however a beginners beer this is like a German hefeweizens bigger older cousin PERIOD He also happens to be a bit angry at the moment but will calm down if you let him sit for a while PERIOD",Pirate beer brings the heat - The Triangle,Drexel University
