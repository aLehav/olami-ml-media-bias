When we picked up our defense our offense picked up Shea said PERIOD It kind of all branched out from good defense PERIOD Our post defense was pretty good today. the Blue and Gold thrived down low with Klie and Shea combining to shoot  from the field PERIOD Klie said good ball movement was key for the Bombers to take advantage of the teams height advantage inside PERIOD

It all starts with good passing inside Klie said PERIOD We try to move the ball in and out and work our highlow game. confessore said despite the early win there are some things the Bombers need to work on PERIOD
