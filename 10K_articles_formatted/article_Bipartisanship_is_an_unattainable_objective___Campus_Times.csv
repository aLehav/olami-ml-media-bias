Anyone following politics today has probably noticed the bitter partisanship and ideological intensity preventing any sort of agreement in Washington PERIOD Some people wish we could go back to the days of parties working together flawlessly as U.S PERIOD representatives first and partisan hacks second PERIOD But there is one big problem PERIOD Historical trends have culminated in this current Congress to create these unbridgeable disagreements that cannot be undone at least not without some highly improbable intervention PERIOD

Anyone who doesnt know history but follows current politics today will be beyond shocked at this next fact The Southeastern United States especially the deepest poorest most racist parts of the Deep South  today the base of the modern Republican Party was once the most solidly monolithic supporter of the Democratic Party PERIOD Thats right Reactionary racists like Strom Thurmond David Duke Jesse Helms and George Wallace were once the proudest Democrats that could ever be PERIOD The Republicans the party of Lincoln had virtually no presence in the South whatsoever  after all the Republicans were the party of Northern Aggression. and because very few blacks and poor whites could vote it was an allwhite block of middleclass and wealthy southern Democratic men and later women who voted for Democrats by almost unanimous margins in South Carolina in  FDR won  PERIOD

For the political junkies reading lets imagine Chuck Schumer and Jeff Sessions being in the same party PERIOD You cant can you But thats exactly what happened during the 1930s and 40s PERIOD With liberal northern Democrats and reactionary southern Democrats these two wings didnt really get along PERIOD As for the Republicans their base was New England liberals and Midwestern conservatives and they also didnt get along PERIOD

Some of you are probably wondering If liberals and conservatives existed in both parties what was the difference between the parties Heres the answer there wasnt one PERIOD Liberal Republicans were sometimes more liberal than liberal Democrats PERIOD Bipartisanship occurred when there were really no party differences to begin with PERIOD In the 1950s the parties were so similar and nonpolarized that political scientists were concerned that voters were not being offered true choices PERIOD Keep in mind this type of similarity across parties is very abnormal for a twoparty system PERIOD The idea of a conservative coalition spanning across parties was rather unusual especially for such a long time PERIOD

What changed it The spark was the Civil Rights Movement PERIOD The southern Democrats were viciously resistant and after Republican presidential candidate Sen PERIOD Barry Goldwater in  opposed the  Civil Rights Act for philosophical not racial reasons the transition to the Republicans began with Strom Thurmond taking the lead and switching parties PERIOD With suburban development and white flight the Consciousness Revolution that tore American culture apart at the seams the rise of the culturally divided Baby Boomers and the aging of the civicminded teambuilding GI Generation of WWII the liberals started to run into the Democratic Party and the conservatives into the Republican Party PERIOD

The ideological sorting is becoming more and more complete with each passing year with moderates having no true home PERIOD The reason the remaining moderate Republicans wont vote with Obama regardless of compromises is that standing up for themselves will earn the ire of the conservative base that controls the GOP PERIOD To be fair the Democrats face the same constraint with their liberal base  just not as much PERIOD

If you want to go back to the 1950s type of bipartisanship you have to turn the South from a diverse multicultural economic boom region back into a poor oneparty state run by wealthy vicious white supremacists who kept their power through fear and terrorism PERIOD And you wont get far with that suggestion PERIOD Even if you did it would not be possible to do so PERIOD The parties cannot return to their past PERIOD

Sure there are far more conservative Democrats than liberal Republicans but with blogs news channels with biased agendas and the endless need to rally your base we are only bound to become more polarized PERIOD Pretty soon Democrats Ben Nelson and Mary Landrieu will be replaced by Republicans and Republicans Susan Collins and Scott Brown will be replaced by Democrats PERIOD Anyone out of step with their constituents ideology has a hard time getting reelected PERIOD

Scott Brown of Massachusetts who won in a perfect storm of a weak opponent discontent with Washington and unpredictable turnout patterns in a special election has a ride for his life in  PERIOD Any Republican who thinks Brown is presidential material is deluded He is prochoice and he has already voted with the Democrats several times PERIOD He will not survive in  because of more predictable turnout patterns a political climate better for Democrats due to a better economy and most likely an opponent who actually campaigns instead of going on vacation PERIOD This is obviously not a guarantee since the future is difficult to predict PERIOD But with more ideological polarization happening by the day political obstruction is bound to get worse PERIOD
