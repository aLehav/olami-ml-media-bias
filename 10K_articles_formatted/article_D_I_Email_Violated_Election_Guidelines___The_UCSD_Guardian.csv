6231,2023-10-08,"guptas Feb PERIOD  email urged students to vote yes in the ongoing special election citing the benefits of higher U.S PERIOD News  World rankings and national prestige if the referendum passes PERIOD On March  Public Education Coalition member Kevin Quirolo filed a grievance against Gupta to the Elections Committee alleging that the email is a breach of neutrality and that Gupta may have accessed the listserv improperly PERIOD Gupta who graduated in  currently works as the UCSD Bay Area Alumni Outreach Officer PERIOD

According to UCSDs Policy and Records Administration the allofficiall listserv includes all individuals including students  with UCSD emails and is usually reserved for campus notices PERIOD The site states that prior approval is necessary and must be approved by a relevant vice chancellor PERIOD

Quirolo also said that many of Guptas claims were false PERIOD According to Quirolo advancing to Division I will not automatically lead to a higher spot in the News  World Report as the magazine does not take sports rankings into account PERIOD

This development makes it difficult for me to accept election results as entirely neutral and valid Quirolo said PERIOD Ive been campaigning and trying to get the word out and this is an example of information people are receiving that is problematic. the Elections Committee reviewed the case on March  PERIOD The committee consists of seven students Advocate General Courtney Hill who chairs the board and does not have a vote and one representative from each of the six colleges PERIOD Hill said that the board does not have information on how Gupta accessed the listserv PERIOD

We agreed that a violation had been committed so we sent it to the JBoard which is the next step Hill said PERIOD

In his grievance Quirolo asked the Elections Committee to publicize the letterwriting campaign he began in response to the email and to denounce Guptas email as an improper effort by a UCSD employee to influence a student election. hill declined to comment on possible sanctions PERIOD

The hearing will be held March  at  p.m PERIOD in the Student Leadership Chambers on the fourth floor of Price Center East PERIOD Hill said that Gupta has the opportunity to be present for his hearing and defend his case which may present logistical problems as he is based in the Bay Area PERIOD

Students can vote in the special election  which asks if they are willing to pay an additional  annually to fund UCSDs move to DI athletics on TritonLink until March  PERIOD

Gupta could not be reached for comment PERIOD
