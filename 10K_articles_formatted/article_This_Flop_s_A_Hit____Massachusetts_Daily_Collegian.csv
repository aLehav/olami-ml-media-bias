Reserve your tickets now folks because the bestworst show to hit Broadway is going to be at Bostons Colonial Theater until Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Thats right Mel Brooks The Producers hit the bay area like a freight train with greasy wheels and its not going to leave until fall PERIOD
This acme of black comedy reinforces what the entertainment industry knew about Mel from the start  hes funny PERIOD The musical garnered twelve Tony awards after its release and the star studded marquis outside the theater quickly turned tickets to the show into an endangered species PERIOD
With the failure of his latest musical fresh on his mind producer Max Bialystock retires to his apartment with nothing ahead of him except for the prospect of being a male gigolo to the nearest retirement village PERIOD That is until mild mannered accountant Leopold Bloom enters the picture and casually mentions the profits that could be made from producing a flop as opposed to a hit PERIOD
Imagining the piles of money that can be made from such a ruse the two set out to find the worst script the stupidest director singers who cant sing and chorus girls who cant dance PERIOD A night full of pouring over books yields a play that is guaranteed to close by page . the neoNazi tribute to der Fuehrer titled Springtime for Hitler is a romp through the fields of Rhineland complete with girls dressed in sausages and pretzels PERIOD
No social group is excluded from Mel Brooks humor whether it is gay Jewish or elderly PERIOD During at least one point in the show you may find yourself asking Should I be laughing at this 
Another moment of pure hilarity occurs when the inept director Roger DeBris flirts with Leo so intensely that the pencil pusher is reduced to cuddling with his blue baby blanket to escape the stress PERIOD
The next twist in the Producers knot comes in the form of a blonde Swedish bombshell named Ulla PERIOD Sure she cant really speak English but has that quality ever been necessary in a secretary Neither Max nor Leo thinks so and the leggy blonde is given the job PERIOD
All the pieces are in play for the worst musical to hit Broadway since Fame but unfortunately for Max and Leo the musical turns out to be a huge success PERIOD As the two bemoan their fate back at the office the neoNazi writer decides to extract his revenge for making Adolf look like a prancing queen PERIOD When the police arrive they soon discover how Max and Leo have been cooking the books PERIOD It isnt long before Max is hauled away to prison while Leo goes to Brazil with Ulla and the two million dollars PERIOD
A smidgen of heart is thrown into the mix when Leo realizes how wrong he was to leave his friend and returns to make his confession in court PERIOD The two land themselves in Sing Sing prison for their debauchery but the musical doesnt end without one last song and dance for Max and Leo PERIOD
Brad Oscar takes the lead as Max Bialystock a role formerly played by Nathan Lane PERIOD His performance is stellar owing in part to the fact that Oscar was Lanes understudy in the Broadway production of The Producers. when vocal nodes and illnesses caused Mr PERIOD Lane to step out of the spotlight Oscar stepped in and performed the role in over seventy occasions PERIOD
The role of the Leopold Bloom the cowardly accountant is filled by Andy Taylor in this production PERIOD Although the New York cast had Matthew Broderick as the nerdy Bloom Taylors performance is terrific nonetheless PERIOD The lack of superstar names in Bostons The Producers doesnt diminish the quality of the performances therein PERIOD
Ida Leigh Curtis played Ullas character in both this version and the original PERIOD Her accent can only be described as a sexy version of the Muppet Shows Swedish chef PERIOD Her choreography is amazing and its clearly true as she chirps in her solo when youve got it flaunt it. the Producers exudes a level of fun youre just not going to get at Les Miserables. ticket prices arent much lower than those found on the Broadway scene decent seats can be found in the  to  range but the steeper price is worth it for the show that Bostons The Producers are putting on this fall PERIOD
