The Washington Post recently ran an article titled  concerning the new human papillomavirus vaccine and the social arguments that are arising out of the vaccines development PERIOD



The article suggested that several groups are advocating that the vaccine be provided to all Americans and that the vaccine should be standardized and given to all schoolage children girls especially PERIOD



It also suggested that some groups are opposed because the vaccine relates to a sexually transmitted disease PERIOD



Opponents argue that if a vaccine is given to schoolage children it will encourage earlier sexual activity PERIOD The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Web sites numbers should explain why the vaccine is so important 



HPV is not just genital warts PERIOD Left untreated it causes cervical cancer which is debilitating and deadly PERIOD As a voting woman living in the United States I feel that any vaccine that would prevent a dangerous disease to both men and women should be available to the population PERIOD



While we wonder what happened to feminism and shrug our shoulders about how everyone is equal now heres something that is going to have a huge affect on the women of America PERIOD And its possible that this beneficial vaccine may be limited and restricted because the disease is transmitted sexually and the majority of victims are women PERIOD



It seems apparent that the benefits of such a vaccine if it is as effective as the Post suggests would outweigh any objections to the source of the disease PERIOD America has always treated disease of sexual nature as deviant and base delaying research and medication until the disease became more socially acceptable or until the outcry was too loud to ignore PERIOD



AIDS affected thousands of Americans in the early 1980s but was kept quiet until  PERIOD The FDA delayed treatment research and drug availability PERIOD It wasnt until  that treatment was made available even in a limited capacity PERIOD STDs get ignored because of their  nature PERIOD



There is no controversy PERIOD Disease transmitted sexually is just like any other disease PERIOD It causes harm discomfort pain and sometime death PERIOD A vaccine against a cancercausing disease should always be made available no matter how the disease is transmitted PERIOD



By limiting the availability of such a beneficial vaccine America sends a message to the women in her country that they are not worth protecting PERIOD America also adds her voice to the ongoing condemnation of people with sexually transmitted diseases whether it is AIDS or herpes or HPV PERIOD
