Nearly a month after winning the race for GUSA executive Trevor Tezel SFS  and Omika Jikaria SFS  were sworn in as president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association on Sunday PERIOD

After the GUSA senate officially certified the results of the Feb PERIOD  election Saturday Tezel and Jikaria acknowledged a subtle ideological shift in the role they believe GUSA should play in students lives PERIOD While continuing Whats A Hoya student conduct events they hope to move GUSAs focus away from programming and toward advocacy PERIOD

Were looking to continue to keep that going while also looking to  the great programming being put on by other student groups and see if we can integrate that into Whats A Hoya so that we are letting them do what they do best and GUSA can continue to focus its resources on being primarily an advocate for the student body Tezel said PERIOD

Jikaria sees this shift as playing to GUSAs strengths PERIOD

I think based on the resources that GUSA has and the connections that it has it should be an advocacy body because thats kind of its strength  and why not capitalize on that Jikaria said PERIOD That being said obviously a lot of student organizations put on great programs so if we can facilitate that great work thats awesome PERIOD But our priority should be kind of advocating for students. the new executive administration is creating a GUSA Transfer Council to address the interests of transfer students as well as a Multicultural Council PERIOD

Senate Speaker and former vice presidential candidate Sam Greco SFS  said he thinks this shift toward advocacy will change the approach of the executive PERIOD

I know that Trevor and Omika  think GUSA is an advocacy body and not a programming body and I think that is one of the bigger philosophical differences that exists in the student government Greco said PERIOD I think that that will affect how they operate a little bit. conversely outgoing GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan SFS  did not see this difference of approaches as important PERIOD

I think that what matters is as long as they continue to be the voice of students how is going to be an afterthought Ramadan said PERIOD

He noted that the Whats A Hoya program came about in response to a student need that surfaced PERIOD

Tezel and Jikaria hope to build upon former GUSA President Nate Tisa SFS  and Ramadans legacy while at the same time accelerating the progress made by the previous administration PERIOD

We need to always be looking not just to improve upon GUSA at the same rate as last year but get an even faster clip of changes and improvements to the student body Tezel said PERIOD

The new executives are currently finalizing their cabinet which they see as key to achieving their policy goals PERIOD

In terms of leadership style we are definitely taking one where we expect and are putting together a staff and cabinet that has the types of personalities that will go out and work on these initiatives without having to be pushed and prodded and I think that thats the difference between a GUSA executive which gets a bit done during the year and a GUSA executive which gets a lot Tezel said PERIOD

According to Tezel an improved senateexecutive relationship is also key to the student governments success PERIOD

Its time for the senate and the executive to bury the hatchet and join together for the betterment of Georgetown PERIOD Some of the brightest and most capable students are sitting in this room today and every day we are not working in a cooperative manner we are falling short of our potential Tezel said in his inaugural speech PERIOD

The administration released executive staff appointments on Sunday including a position for an executivesenate liaison filled by senior advisor Ben Weiss COL  who ran for president with Greco as his running mate PERIOD

There has not really been the greatest of relationships between previous executives and the senate  or at least a lack of communication  and having someone in the executive actively working to make sure that it is a positive collaborative relationship is a priority for both the new executive and current senate leadership said Weiss a current senator PERIOD

Tisa and Ramadan delivered their farewell addresses Saturday with Tisa reflecting on the importance of student opinion in decisionmaking PERIOD

Georgetown is a massive institution PERIOD It has an educational mission but it balances financial constraints differing entities different viewpoints differing philosophies PERIOD And sometimes it gets it wrong PERIOD And Georgetown students are the conscience to that situation Tisa said PERIOD

The outgoing GUSA president also reaffirmed GUSAs role as an advocate for students and a way to give a voice to student needs PERIOD

GUSA doesnt really have any power Tisa said PERIOD We have a voice and when we mobilize students when people vote in our elections and engage with us that voice starts having power. hoya Staff Writer
