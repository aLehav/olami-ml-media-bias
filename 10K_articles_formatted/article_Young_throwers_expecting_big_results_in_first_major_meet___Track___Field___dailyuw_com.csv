Updated November     pm



For Washington throwers coach Reedus Thurmond this weekends Pepsi Team Invitational in Eugene Ore. isnt all about results  at least not on paper PERIOD

Rather Thurmond just wants to see that his proteges are taking the lessons learned in practice and applying them in meets PERIOD

 Thurmond said PERIOD 

Thurmond will be breaking in a young group of throwers and this will be the first meet for many of them PERIOD

Gone is graduated senior Zack Midles who was not only an AllAmerican but a leader on and off the field PERIOD His absence means that others will have to step up both in terms of results and leadership PERIOD

 Thurmond said PERIOD 

It would be unrealistic to expect one athlete to step in and automatically fill Midles large shoes PERIOD With that in mind Thurmond hopes his athletes take on a leadershipbycommittee mentality PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

That being said Thurmond does have talented new blood to replace what hes lost PERIOD Youth is the theme of this years throwers group  but its talented youth PERIOD

 Thurmond said PERIOD 

For his part Anderson just wants to get the season off on the right foot PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD
