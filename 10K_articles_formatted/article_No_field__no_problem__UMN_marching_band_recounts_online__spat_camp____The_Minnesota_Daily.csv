Imagine all the facets of creating a new sports team  getting everyone acquainted learning and practicing plays forming a team dynamic PERIOD Now imagine trying to do all of that via Zoom PERIOD

Well this year thats exactly what COVID19 forced the University of Minnesota marching band to do PERIOD

Due to a Board of Regents decision in late August the marching band played music learned marches and created a community all online PERIOD

Band director Betsy McCann said that two days before the marching band was supposed to begin spat camp the Board of Regents announced all undergraduate classes would be online for at least the first two weeks PERIOD McCann had one day to collaborate with student leaders about converting the inperson band boot camp to a virtual format PERIOD

Despite the quick switch they were able to teach marching fundamentals and keep spirits high among students PERIOD

Typically spat camp  named after the rubber spat students wear on their marching shoes  starts two weeks before school PERIOD According to fourthyear drum major Chamberlain Gregg band members meet every day for an intense 12hour rehearsal PERIOD

In those two weeks members taught rookies the band basics learned a pregame and halftime show and bonded over their mutual fatigue PERIOD

I know that us teaching looks completely different right now being over Zoom fourthyear block captain Bethany Mestelle said but were still teaching fundamentally the same way and were teaching the same things. in order to make online learning easier for the 300plus band members leaders took advantage of breakout rooms PERIOD

During the Zoom rehearsals which had been shortened to six hours McCann said Mestelle or Gregg would teach a concept to the entire band then move them into breakout rooms PERIOD In smaller groups band leaders could give a more comprehensive explanation allowing students to practice and receive feedback right away PERIOD

It was so cool said Andrew Bremner a firstyear baritone player PERIOD I felt like I improved and got a lot of useful information about music. after the virtual rehearsals they had virtual hangouts PERIOD

Weve been having so many events in our free time and on the weekends that we never would have had if we were in person just because we would all be exhausted and busy all the time Mestelle said PERIOD

Across the band there have been game nights movie nights and meals with other sections PERIOD

Bremner said he appreciated these events as they helped him assimilate into the band PERIOD

I got really accepted into the group right away he said PERIOD I really didnt feel a divide. mestelle said she felt more connected to the band than in years prior because of their Zoom activities PERIOD She said normally she wouldnt interact with people outside of her own section but now she talks to them regularly PERIOD

Starting this week the band resumed inperson instruction PERIOD McCann said she split the band into two performing groups PERIOD Each group will learn a pregame show and a halftime show PERIOD A video of each performance will be posted on Facebook later this semester PERIOD

She said members are marching six feet apart have cut slits into their masks so they can play while wearing a mask and have special instrument covers PERIOD

While the marching band was able to accomplish its goals over Zoom fourthyear mellophone team leader Molly Lampone says shes ready to be back in person PERIOD

Its just a certain energy that comes when were all together she said PERIOD This is like my family my home. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
