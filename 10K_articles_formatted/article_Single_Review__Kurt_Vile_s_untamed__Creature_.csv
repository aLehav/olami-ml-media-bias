Theres something about Kurt Viles softspoken backwoods drawl that makes it tough to believe hes actually from Philadelphia His lucid folk is shot through with such dense melancholy and afterhours mysticism that its tough to peg him being from anywhere but the strange gothic jungles of the South PERIOD Something feels much untamed and its not just his thick tangle of hair PERIOD Having spent the better part of the last year touring behind last springs affecting Smoke Ring for My Halo Vile is nothing if not active despite his decidedly slacker aesthetic PERIOD

The CreatureMatador

Viles recently released single The Creature taken from the upcoming So Outta Reach EP is driven by his embittered vocal delivery and some inspired 12string fingerpicking that recalls legendary folkie John Fahey to whom Viles been compared favorably PERIOD Backing Vile are the everloyal Violators here contributing a slowburning organ and a sparse rhythm section that makes the most out of some shakers and a steadybutpowerful bass drum stomp PERIOD Lines like They call me the creature of habit  But Im a man you just aint ring with a certain plaintive confidence you just cant find in less roadweary or maybe just plain lifeweary artists PERIOD And frankly its tough not to agree with him PERIOD
