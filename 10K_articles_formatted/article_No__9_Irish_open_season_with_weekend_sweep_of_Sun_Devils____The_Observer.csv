No PERIOD  Notre Dame kicked off its  campaign in dominant fashion this weekend besting Arizona State in the Friday night season opener  followed by a  win on Saturday PERIOD

The Irish  had no trouble with the Sun Devils  on Friday night opening the offensive floodgates as soon as the puck dropped PERIOD Junior forwards Anders Bjork and Bo Brauer each led the Irish with two goals and sophomore defensemen Bobby Nardella tallied two as well PERIOD Junior defensemen Jordan Gross and sophomore forwards Andrew Oglevie and Dylan Malmquist also chipped in goals for Notre Dame which by the end of the game had  players notch at least one point PERIOD Irish head coach Jeff Jackson talked about the speed of his team and how it contributed to their offensive production PERIOD

I thought especially early in the game we were using our speed really well Jackson said PERIOD I thought that was putting them on their heels and thats how we have to play PERIOD We want to play fast and push the puck out of our zone and into the neutral zone as quickly as possible. the overpowering speed of the Irish forced the Sun Devils into many hooking penalties throughout the game PERIOD Notre Dame outshot ASU  mainly because the Irish outnumbered the Sun Devils on the ice much of the game due to the ASU penalties PERIOD The Sun Devils racked up  minutes in penalties and the Irish capitalized with six of their goals coming on powerplay opportunities which Jackson thought were executed well throughout most of the game PERIOD

When we stayed with our structure I thought we were really good Jackson said PERIOD In the second period we got a little too creative a little individualistic  we werent as sharp passing the puck  but thats what happens when you get a three goal lead PERIOD I thought we were good moving the puck PERIOD Different guys were a threat and thats what a good power play does PERIOD Its not just one guy its got to be three guys. on Saturday Notre Dame picked up where they left off the night before with a goal by junior forward Connor Hurley off an assist by Bjork  seconds into the game PERIOD ASU quickly responded no more than  seconds later to tie it up and that would end the scoring for the period although Notre Dame did generate some exciting chances PERIOD ASU would take a couple of penalties in the last minute of firstperiod action that ultimately carried over to the second PERIOD The game stayed tied at  and it seemed that the Sun Devils would be staying in this one PERIOD

Starting off with a 5on3 advantage Notre Dame was able to take back the lead early in the second with powerplay goal by Bjork  seconds in PERIOD A Notre Dame penalty five minutes later allowed ASU to generate some strong chances and it would finally convert off a goal in front that just cleared the shoulder of junior goalkeeper Cal Petersen PERIOD The two teams would go backandforth for a solid stretch of the second as each side tried to take the  edge in the game PERIOD As the second period began to wind down the Sun Devils presented themselves with a couple of huge opportunities but thanks to a tremendous save by Petersen and a disallowed goal due to a penalty the game stayed at  and the Irish continued to fight to avoid the upset PERIOD

The second intermission did Notre Dame well as the team came out with a flurry of chances right off the bat and capitalized on a rebound less than two minutes into the period to reclaim the lead PERIOD The goal would come yet again off the stick of Bjork making it his second of the night PERIOD Leading the offensive effort throughout the weekend for the team Bjork recognized how important the strong starts to the period were for the Irish PERIOD

I think thats a big objective of ours and something weve been focusing on is just coming out strong and setting the tone for the period Bjork said PERIOD We havent always done that so the leaders on the team have really stressed it and thats helped us to make it happen. notre Dame would stay on the attack and didnt let up as they continued to press the Sun Devils in an effort to extend the lead PERIOD Eventually after tacking on an empty netter the Irish survived the upset bid and walked away with a  victory PERIOD Jackson said he was pleased overall with the weekend and recognized that the team now faces a tough test next weekend as it take on No PERIOD  MinnesotaDuluth PERIOD

Were playing a very good hockey team come this weekend and were going to have to eliminate some of the things that hurt us this weekend Jackson said PERIOD We committed too many turnovers this weekend and against a team like Duluth thatll kill you so we have to just be a little bit smarter with the puck at the offensive blue line specifically. share This Story
