8963,2023-11-04,"on Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD well more like   they were late students gathered in the Pause for comedy duo Dave and Ethans College Dating Coaches show PERIOD Some in the audience knew them from their online videos which have garnered millions of views on YouTube PERIOD To others their show was a completely new experience PERIOD Either way their show was highly anticipated by the St PERIOD Olaf community and Dave and Ethan even tailored their show specifically for Oles PERIOD They deserved the hype PERIOD

The diverse show included musical numbers audience participation bad accent imitations and a fairly awkward dating game PERIOD Dave and Ethan were genuinely funny and had the audience roaring all night PERIOD

They began the show with a spoton recreation of the typical day of a student at St PERIOD Olaf PERIOD Dave and Ethan played two stereotypical firstyear girls and went through the entire day from eating in the Caf to going to a Pause dance PERIOD They had definitely done their research PERIOD They compared the palace that is Ellingson to the rundown mess of Kittelsby freaked out over a sighting of John Bruer  complained about the Wifi and expressed anxiety over getting craycray before a Pause dance despite the dry campus policy PERIOD

Dave and Ethan then moved on to a more serious topic how to pick up girls PERIOD They told the audience that the only foolproof way to pick up a girl is to use an accent PERIOD Because everyone likes a foreign accent right Wrong PERIOD Dave and Ethan struggled with the rather obscure accents they were given by the audience  Lebanese and Czechoslovakian  but it was quite entertaining watching them try PERIOD

Next the two asked for an audience member with a bad first date story to share it with everyone PERIOD A brave young man stepped onto the stage to share his story which included an overeager girl and a lie he had to tell in order to get away PERIOD Dave and Ethan then reenacted the story but twisted the ending so that instead of running away the boy was honest with his date and told her that she made him uncomfortable PERIOD It was a hilarious teachable moment PERIOD

Potentially the most uncomfortable part of the show was the finale the dating game PERIOD One girl was asked onto the stage and three men were also called up PERIOD She sat behind a screen and asked her potential suitors a series of questions and then made her decision about who shed most like to date PERIOD The questions ranged from Whats your favorite flavor of ice cream to Show us your best dance move using your arms only. unfortunately for the audience all three of the male participants were illprepared to answer questions on the spot PERIOD They were definitely not the best audience participants but Dave and Ethan handled the awkwardness well and successfully diffused any tension PERIOD

Overall the show was thoroughly enjoyable PERIOD While Dave and Ethan may not have taught audience members much about dating or love they certainly gained some new fans here at St PERIOD Olaf PERIOD
