8998,2023-02-09,"on Sept PERIOD  the newly created Short Film Club held its first ever meeting PERIOD Its creator Kyle Hand  has the goal of making the club the ultimate collaboration of creators on campus as he is motivated to bring people interested in acting directing costume design and many more PERIOD Hand has experience with the Nevergreens and Improv Club on campus and has always had an interest in writing and the beauty of filmmaking PERIOD

The club has something for everybody he said PERIOD

The club hopes to be juggling multiple projects at once in order to keep every section busy throughout the semester PERIOD For each film project taken on by the club Hand hopes to split the duties into preproduction production and postproduction crews which will effectively give members a chance to expand their creative horizons PERIOD

Hand hopes everyone involved with the club understands the purpose of the group is to learn and grow together as a community PERIOD To succeed in this business we have to help each other out. another exciting aspect of the club is Hands vision of having an Oscarlike screening at the end of the semester PERIOD By renting out a space to display the films produced over the course of the semester dressing up in formal attire and inviting all who were involved and their friends the event could be a minigala on the Evergreen campus PERIOD

Its new its experimental and its going to be a great time Hand said PERIOD

Even though the first introductory meeting has passed the Short Film Club is always looking for people interested in any aspect of the filmmaking process and by contacting Kyle Hand at emailprotected the opportunities are endless
