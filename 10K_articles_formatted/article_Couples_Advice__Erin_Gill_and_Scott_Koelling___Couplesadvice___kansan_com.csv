Erin and Scott enjoying an evening on the Plaza together in Kansas City PERIOD

As Erin Gill a junior from Prairie Village was sitting in an ABSC lecture class her freshman year she expected it to be just another ordinary class period PERIOD When the teacher asked everyone to partner up Gill gazed around the room to find a familiar face in the crowd but after seeing everyone she knew already had a partner she tapped the person next to her and with a smile asked if he wanted to work on the assignment together PERIOD The two ended up hitting it off realizing they were both art majors and shared a love for theater PERIOD Gill and Scott Koelling a junior from Dallas have been dating ever since PERIOD

Two and a half years later the couple maintains a strong relationship by not worrying about the small stuff in life PERIOD

Dating Tip Dont get mad that something small will ruin your relationship its all about balance and giving each other space PERIOD

While one of Gill and Koellings favorite things to do together is to go down to Kansas City and explore the Plaza they are still able to live separate lives and support each other in their individual endeavors PERIOD  Koelling says PERIOD 

Trust is everything in a relationship and throughout their years together Gill and Koelling have learned that it is extremely important not to lose their individuality in one another PERIOD  Gill says PERIOD 

Take note because this couple proves that with a little balance and a lot of trust a relationship can start off as ordinary as two strangers meeting in class and transform into something a little more extraordinary PERIOD
