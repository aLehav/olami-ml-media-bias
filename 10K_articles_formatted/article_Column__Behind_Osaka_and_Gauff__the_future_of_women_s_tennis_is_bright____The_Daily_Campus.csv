Its been a rough week at the U.S PERIOD Open in the world of mens tennis.Hereisa shortlist ofthe buzziest stories from this years tournamentNo PERIOD 5seedDaniil Medvedevthrowsa series of tantrumsthe crowdboos himtopseeded NovakDjokovicretiresheadmitsthatthebig retirementis near PERIOD Ohand the crowd inexplicably booshim too PERIOD

ThedispleasedcrowdswhichMedvedev thanked for the motivationandwhichweredeservedlyripped for booing Djokovic havemade more headlines than the athletes.RogerFederer is now gone and whileRafaelNadal has shown flashes of vintage greatnessthathasbeen largely lost in the noise PERIOD

The biggest story on the womens sidePerhapsthe best sports moment of the yearwhen Naomi Osakacomforted CocoGauffafter theirthird round match.Osaka whowas showered with boosin last years controversial final against Serena Williamsdefeated the beloved 15year old Americanin straight sets PERIOD

Last year when Osaka took down the fan favorite shestared at the ground and accepted her fatelabeled avillain for no fault of her own.This year sheturned the moment into a heartwarming display of sportsmanshipand respect PERIOD

Gauff who hasrightfullytaken the tennisworld by storm after a Cinderella run at Wimbledon wasvisibly upset after thefinal point wiping away tears as the crowd provided a standingovation.When the two met at the netOsakawho sensedGauffsdespairdespitebecoming the youngestwomanin the third roundof theOpen in over two decadesmade an offer rarely seen inprofessionaltennis PERIOD

She told me that Idid amazingand good luck and then she asked ifI could do the oncourt interview with herGauffsaid fighting back tears PERIOD I said no because I knew that I was going to cry the whole time but she encouraged meto do it. osaka is six years older than Coco but at  years old that doesnt say a whole lot.The world No PERIOD 1and reigning U.S PERIOD Open champ Osaka put on an absolute clinic needing justover an hourof near flawless tennis to defeat the young American.Shes already got two Grand Slams under her belt a feat Coco seemscertainlyable to match PERIOD

Osakadid amazing and Im going to learn a lot from this match PERIOD Shes been so sweet to me so thank you for thisGauffcontinued turningto look at her opponent.Thank you. with both playersyet to reach their peak the heavilyanticipated match wasathrilling glimpse into the future of womens tennis PERIOD It wasnt competitive this time around but its likely and hopefully far from the last time these two will face off PERIOD

Gauffhanded the mic over to Osaka not wanting to stealthe spotlightthe two embracing once again.Before speakingaboutanything else Osaka addressed Cocos parents in the stands PERIOD

You guys raised an amazing playerOsakasaid tears of her own now flowing PERIOD I used to see you guys training in the same placeas us and the fact that both of us made it and were both still workingas hard as we can I think its incredible.I think you guys are amazing and Coco I think youre amazing. the only Japanese woman to win a Grand SlamOsaka hasspokenopenly about herstruggles with lonelinesson tour.Last years Openwinshouldve been amoment of pure bliss PERIOD Instead as boos rained downthough not directed at herOsakacould only celebrate in silence.AfterSaturdays matchit seems shewalked off withmore than just a victory on the court PERIOD

For me the definition of an athlete is someone who on the court treats you like your worst enemy but off the court can be your best friendGauffsaid later PERIOD I think thats what she Osaka did tonight. despite the brilliance she showed againstCoco Osakas title defense came to an endon Tuesday falling to No PERIOD 13Belinda Bencic the third time that shes lost to Bencic thisseason.Osaka was poised andrespectful as alwaysquietly walking off without any interview this time PERIOD

It wasperhapsan indication thatOsaka who has been inconsistent since earning the title of world No PERIOD  likeGauff is not quite readyto be one of the games greats.MeanwhileWilliamswho has expressed her deepapologies for last years finalis two wins away from a24th Grand Slam PERIOD

The torch has yet to be passed PERIOD But when it isOsaka andGauffwill be morethan willing to be the faces of womens tennis together PERIOD
