4095,2007-10-12,"for the  UCSB mens water polo team  overall  Mountain Pacific Sports Federation this weekends Southern California Tournament in Irvine is a time of opportunity and a chance to make a major statement to other teams around the conference PERIOD

Of the  teams competing in the tournament  are nationally ranked in the top  PERIOD A strong Gaucho performance would legitimize its status as an elite team in the nation and put it up there with  USC  Cal  Stanford and  UCLA all of which will be competing in the tournament PERIOD Overall the top eight teams in the nation will be in the water at Irvine PERIOD

UCSB finds itself in a bracket with fourtime defending tournament champion USC as well as  Loyola Marymount University and the University of Redlands PERIOD Failing to win the bracket would mean the Gauchos would finish no higher than fifth so a win against USC is crucial if the team intends to finish among the elite PERIOD

Santa Barbara will get things going against LMU which it has already beaten twice this season PERIOD The Gauchos have outscored the Lions  in two meetings although the second match was considerably closer than the final score indicated PERIOD

In recent weeks the Gauchos fought off a frustrating midseason slide that saw them drop six of seven with five of those defeats coming by a single goal PERIOD As has been the case all year UCSB will turn to its senior leaders at key positions for this pivotal point in the season PERIOD Senior goalie Rick Wright senior 2meter Matt Dale and senior driver Ross Sinclair will be looked upon for leadership as they head into the homestretch of their final season PERIOD

The Gauchos first game against LMU is scheduled for  a.m PERIOD at the Corona del Mar High School Pool in Newport Beach Calif PERIOD Subsequent games are determined by results from other tournament games PERIOD
