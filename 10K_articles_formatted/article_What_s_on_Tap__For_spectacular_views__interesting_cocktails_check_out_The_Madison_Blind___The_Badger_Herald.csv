There isnt much cocktail bar The Madison Blind doesnt offer to its customers PERIOD

Near campus Check PERIOD A rooftop bar Check PERIOD Spectacular views of both the lake and the capital Double check PERIOD Combining these elements The Madison Blind might be one of the most unique bars on the isthmus PERIOD

Located above the Graduate Hotel at  Langdon St. the Madison Blind is a sleek modern cocktail bar and lounge that boasts great food and drinks to couple with the amazing view PERIOD While it is located on Langdon Street it resembles any upscale bar foundnear the Capitol PERIOD

After riding an elevator to the top of the hotel for access to The Blind customers are welcomed into a bar area thats perfectly arranged PERIOD People lounging in the chairs are scattered throughout either chatting with the bartender or ordering a drink PERIOD

Stepping back into the open table area walltowall windows surround the designer furniture PERIOD At night dimly lit candles set an appropriate mood throughout PERIOD

After finding a seatand scanning the menu I ended up going with the Puncho Villa a jalapeoinfused tequila based drink with agave nectar cucumber watermelon lime juices and mint PERIOD My friend went with the Mendota Martini made with cucumber gin simple syrup lemon juice and orange marmalade PERIOD

While waiting for the drinks to make their way to our table we checkedout the outside to take in the bars renowned view.While the Capitol only pops up slightly over the other surrounding buildings in the area it still makes for a great sight PERIOD

Shortly after we came back to our table the drinks arrive PERIOD After taking our first few sips and were pleasantly surprised PERIOD The jalapeo tequila definitely provides an interesting kick but pairs very smoothly with the concoction of juices added into the cocktail PERIOD Its slightly spicy yet smooth savory and even a little sweet PERIOD

The Mendota Martini was a delight as well and it was just as sweet and fruity as I expected it to be PERIOD Its definitely a perfect drink one could enjoy out up top on the bars patio during a hot and humid summer day PERIOD

Drinks and atmosphere aside the Blind may have some limitations in terms of the type of outings it can host PERIOD Its refined cocktails and breathtaking views are perfect for a relaxed night out with some friends or a first date that requires a strong first impression PERIOD

Overall I definitely recommend checking the Blind out PERIOD For a more cultured chill experience that few bars nearby can offer along with beautiful views to accompany the Blind simply cant be beat PERIOD
