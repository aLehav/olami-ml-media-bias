As a DIII fan sometimes you have to content yourself with a humbler sports experience PERIOD The rivalries at this level are more muted there arent stadiums with seats enough for the adult population of Guam students wont tent outside Ratner to get front row seats at the game and its only the rare bookie who takes action on UChicagoBrandeis PERIOD

One thing fans dont give up when they take a rooting interest in DIII is the excitement of chasing the postseason PERIOD The bubble watch bracketology and Selection Sunday well more often Monday are alive and well in DIII and already teams on campus are working to position themselves for NCAA tournament berths PERIOD

Just what that means differs from sport to sport but broadly making the cut for NCAAs is similar for all of the team sports baseball basketball football soccer softball tennis and volleyball PERIOD

In all of those the Maroons compete for slots in a national championship tournament PERIOD Even DIII football has a 32team playoff and has had since  giving it  years of bragging rights over its lessfortunate sibling the Football Bowl Series FBS PERIOD

The catch there is that Chicagos position in DIII football is a lot like Boise States in the FBS PERIOD The UAA champion doesnt get an automatic bid but champions in  other conferences do leaving only nine spots up for grabs PERIOD Three of those are reserved for teams that like Chicago are independent or come from conferences without automatic bids the other six are atlarge open to anyone PERIOD

In football about  teams compete for the three independent bids and more than  for the six atlarge bids PERIOD The Maroons have to be at the top of either of those pools to make the tournament and good luck getting there however talented your team may be PERIOD

Go undefeated football head coach Dick Maloney said when asked what his team has to do to qualify PERIOD If you go undefeated youre going to get in PERIOD If you lose one you have a possibility. baseball and softball are in a similar position PERIOD To have an automatic bid in a sport a conference needs seven teams competing and while the UAA hits that mark in basketball soccer tennis and volleyball its just shy in baseball and softball PERIOD

Unlike football the NCAA doesnt cap the tournament field at  teams in those other sports PERIOD For them the total number of qualifiers is figured by taking the number of teams that play in DIII then dividing that by . or by . in tennis PERIOD That usually means a field of between  and  teams this year  teams will qualify in mens tennis and  in mens soccer PERIOD

Along with increased field size come more atlarge and independent bids so teams in those sports can slip up during the regular season not win the UAA title and still make the NCAA tournament PERIOD

But for teams that dont get the conferences bidand for those that cant like baseball and softballtheres a complicated calculus involved in getting a bid PERIOD In essence the NCAA ranks teams against other schools in their region during the final weeks of the season using a formula that draws on the teams record regional win percentage opponents win percentage and opponents opponents win percentage PERIOD

With those regional rankings in hand the NCAA committees meet usually on the Sunday after a sports regular season ends PERIOD The committees select the best teams that didnt get automatic or independent bids and theres no guarantee that each region will receive the same number of bids PERIOD More teams are selected from stronger regions fewer from weaker regions PERIOD

As always theres an exception to all of this Cross country teams can qualify collectively for the NCAA meet if they finish in the top five at their regional meetregional rankings arent a factor PERIOD The top two teams at the regional meet qualify automatically and the committee can invite teams three through five at its discretion the Midwest Region where Chicago competes usually sends the full five teams PERIOD Like tennis players runners can qualify individually too but thats a matter for another article. once the teams in the championship are chosen the committee has to craft its bracket and chose matchups PERIOD The overriding factor here is geographic proximity an effort is made to pair the best teams with the weakest in first round games but more important is putting all teams at a venue within  miles of their campus PERIOD Typically four teams are put at each venue for first and secondround games and although the committee tries to keep the best teams at home sometimes the 500mile rule means a weaker team hosts PERIOD

Once the committee has met the field is decided and the matchups and host sites are chosen the drama still isnt over PERIOD Lest DIII athletes miss out on the nervewracking proceedings DI basketball players go through on the Selection Sunday specials the NCAA broadcasts the announcement of the brackets PERIOD

The announcement usually happens the Monday after brackets are finalized and teams can gather to learn their fate together PERIOD The selection process leading up to that moment is by turns complicated and convoluted but if at last Chicagos name is revealed on the bracket it all suddenly seems worth it PERIOD
