Its a really tricky topic to take on Hedigansaid PERIOD People feel uncomfortable talking about mental health PERIOD But its something people need to start thinking about PERIOD Just because you cant always see it and its harder to diagnose doesnt mean theres not real issues. business administration junior and president of Tau Kappa Epsilon TKE fraternity CJ Estores said many TKE members are planning on attending the events throughout the week in honor of Aaron Wolf a brother they recently lost to suicide PERIOD

I dont think people understand the gravity of mental health that its as deadly as other diseases Estores said PERIOD It can ruin a lot of great things if its not taken care of. hedigan said he is a little nervous that people wont want to participate in some events because mental health can be an uncomfortable topic to discuss but is optimistic there will be a big turnout PERIOD

We just hope were making it as friendly and inviting as possible Hedigansaid PERIOD
