Many college students have heard or used one of these lines during a night out on the town PERIOD The question is do pick up lines ever work With some oldfashioned creativity there is a chance it might be effective  all it takes is proper timing and the right execution PERIOD Here is a Top  list of classic pick up lines PERIOD The more ridiculous the line the greater the chance the other person will laugh PERIOD And a laugh can be all it takes to start up a conversation PERIOD Chaching  youre in

 PERIOD Are you a parking ticket Because you have fine written all over you PERIOD

But be aware of the context and your delivery PERIOD Most of the time these lines will be useful in large group settings such as the bars or a frat party PERIOD It catches the other persons attention immediately and becomes a hilarious icebreaker PERIOD However given the fact that it is in a large setting most people are conscious of the lame creepers lurking around using pickup lines PERIOD So be original seriousness is out of the question and laughing is acceptable PERIOD

As seen on VH1s television show The Pick Up Artist there is an art to using pickup lines but this show takes picking up women FAR too seriously  PERIOD avoid this at all costs PERIOD No one wants to listen to someone who is trying too hard  acting desperate is not attractive PERIOD Use common sense when attempting to pick someone up PERIOD Spewing lines at a funeral or during church is never going to be acceptable  period PERIOD There is a time and place for using pickup lines but never underestimate their power PERIOD A few witty lines and the next thing you know you are walking away with a phone number or who knows maybe more PERIOD
