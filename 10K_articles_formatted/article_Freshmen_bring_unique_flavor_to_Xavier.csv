The four freshmen players on the Xaviers womens basketball team this year  Maddy Johnson Lauren Wasylson Carrie Gross and Ayanna Townsend  are all unique in their own respect PERIOD

One has never broken a bone PERIOD One has a sour skittlescoffee addiction PERIOD One always tears the cheese off her pizza then eats it PERIOD The last always puts her left sock on first PERIOD

Despite these differences when I asked about their majors the unknown similarities came out PERIOD

Business and entrepreneurship Johnson said PERIOD

Business Undecided maybe Marketing Wasylson said PERIOD Business and Marketing Gross said PERIOD We all looked to Townsend expectantly PERIOD Social Science she said PERIOD

The girls began laughing at the fact they never knew that almost all of them were in the same major PERIOD Through their giggles the discussion continued about their ambitions and what they wanted to do with their majors PERIOD

I have to work for myself Gross said PERIOD Im all about that money you know

Johnson agreed stating she wants to open up a multisport exercise complex one day much like a friend of hers back home in California PERIOD

I wanna work with kids Townsend said PERIOD But Im really into anatomy so Ive been thinking about therapy and like occupational therapy for mentallydisabled kids but who knows

I have no idea Wasylson said PERIOD Ideally she hopes to play basketball internationally one day PERIOD

When asked how they balanced their schoolwork and time on the court the girls collectively groaned PERIOD

Its tough Gross said PERIOD The grind never stops. i had a hard time adjusting Wasylson said PERIOD You have such rigorous academics and then you go to practice PERIOD With all that stress it just becomes a nonstop cycle PERIOD

But Ive gotten used to it now Wasylson added once the laughter had subsided PERIOD

I mean there really are no off days because off days are for homework but you get used to it Gross echoed PERIOD

But the girls are there for one another both on and off the court PERIOD

I know based off the first scrimmage we had that we all connected well on the court and we connected well teammate wise Wasylson said PERIOD
