When it comes to assessing the state of Americas largest
fighting force Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is an Army of
one PERIOD

 Rumsfeld insisted last week PERIOD 

 puts us in mind of the
Monty Python skit about the man who brings a dead parrot back to
the pet shop PERIOD  the
shop owner says PERIOD 

Contrary to Rumsfelds sanguine remarks two studies released in
January said that three years of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq
coupled with related recruiting and retention problems have
severely strained the Army PERIOD A study done for the Pentagon by
military analyst Andrew Krepinevich says the Army has been reduced
to a  Another study done for congressional
Democrats cited a risk of 

While those two studies were getting all the publicity a copy
of the Pentagons latest  was being
leaked to InsideDefense.com a Web site for military insiders PERIOD In
opaque bureaucratic language the QDR comes to largely the same
conclusions as the other two studies 

In other words as long as the Army is going to rotate units in
and out of Iraq it may not be broken but its not going to be
able to do much of anything else PERIOD Long term the QDR says the
Pentagon better start planning for how it would deal with a  competitor i.e. china with a downsized U.S PERIOD force PERIOD

So thats three reports one done by an independent analyst one
done for his political opponents and one done inside the Pentagon
itself that seem to dispute Rumsfelds dont worry be happy
views PERIOD

Rep PERIOD Ike Skelton of Missouri the top Democrat on the House
Armed Services Committee released a letter he wrote Jan PERIOD  to
Rumsfeld PERIOD Skelton said the Armys wornout equipment has placed the
force  and estimated the cost of replacing or
repairing it at  billion PERIOD The figure continues to grow he said
and doesnt include the cost of modernizing the Army which he said
could exceed  billion PERIOD

Finally there is this assessment from Gen PERIOD George Casey the
Armys top commander in Iraq 

Todays Army is a lethal fighting force PERIOD But can it stay that
way Given Rumsfelds lousy prewar planning and nonexistent
postwar planning it is an open question PERIOD
