October marks the beginning of LGBTQ History Month a time dedicated to commemorating the contributions this marginalized group has made to history and memorializing the struggle theyve faced and continue to face today PERIOD The United States began recognizing LGBTQ History Month in  as it coincides with National Coming Out Day on Oct PERIOD  and it commemorates the October  and  LGBTQ Marches on Washington PERIOD

In observance of LGBTQ History Month Rainbow Alliance and Promise have put together a series of events to celebrate and uplift the queer community on campus PERIOD Promise hopes to provide the Post community with memorable engaging and inclusive events and programming throughout October Anthony White a success coach whos been working with Rainbow Alliance to coordinate events throughout the month said PERIOD But more important is continuing our awareness for LGBTQ rights and equality for all peoples. the month began with a virtual discussion with LGBT Network Vice President Robert Virtelli on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD If students missed out on this event however theres still plenty to come throughout the rest of October PERIOD

Coming up we also have our video series Were Still Coming Out where people who want to can submit videos of their own coming out stories Nicole Ludwig a senior psychology major and the president of Rainbow Alliance said PERIOD Finally we have our LGBTQ identity mixer on the  the screening of the movie Milk also on the  and of the movie Moonlight on the . all events are listed on Experience Shark Nation as well as the Rainbow Alliance instagram page liupostrainbowalliance and the Promise instagram page postliupromise PERIOD

In hosting these events Rainbow Alliance hopes to continue to develop Post as a safe space for the LGBTQ Community PERIOD One of our largest communities on campus are our LGBTQ individuals PERIOD It is important that all people including those within the LGBTQ community feel respected safe and welcomed while immersed in the Post community White said PERIOD

Ludwig echoed Whites hopes for what the events of October might do for Posts LGBTQ Community PERIOD We hope to do two things to educate and to create a safe space for LGBTQ students and faculty PERIOD These two go hand in hand as education promotes a safe space and a safe space promotes education and learning she said PERIOD

Even if students arent able to attend the events Promise and Rainbow Alliance are hosting there are other ways they can observe LGBTQ History Month PERIOD As a marginalized group LGBTQ voices are often left out of historical narratives PERIOD Its crucial to question who wrote what you are reading and whose experiences the text is focusing on Ludwig said PERIOD If your textbooks and sources are all written by white men that are cisgender and heterosexual then you might not be getting every side of the story even if the authors had no intention of leaving anybody out or of having any kind of bias. though LGBTQ History Month allows the queer community to fondly reflect on how far theyve come in the struggle for LGBTQ Rights October also functions as an important reminder of how much work still needs to be done especially in todays political climate PERIOD

The Trump administration has attacked LGBTQ rights continuously a lot of which have been targeted towards the trans community Ludwig said PERIOD Its important because LGBT rights are human rights PERIOD To deny us of our right to be ourselves and to be protected under federal law is dehumanizing and cruel PERIOD Inequality kills. students looking to become more involved in the LGBTQ Community on campus can attend any of the events being hosted this month and as always the Rainbow Alliance continues to create safe spaces for any and all members of the queer community here at Post PERIOD

For some people college is the first time people can be out or even question or explore their sexuality or gender identity Ludwig said PERIOD Rainbow Alliance is supposed to serve as a space where no matter what your situation is outside of said space you can feel safe supported and have some fun with people who support you. published in Features Social Media and Front Page
