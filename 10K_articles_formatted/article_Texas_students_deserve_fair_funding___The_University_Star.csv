Texas States tuition has been rising every year since  which is not unusual for any Texas university PERIOD However the rate at which Texas States tuition is rising outpaces that of the University of Texas and Texas AM PERIOD This is due to a Texas constitutional endowment called the Permanent University Fund in  PERIOD
The PUF designates . million acres of Texas as land to be leased by oil and gas companies in order to provide funding to only the University of Texas and Texas AM the first universities in Texas PERIOD Between  and  the PUF funded . billion in projects for the two universities PERIOD
While the PUF remains a competitive advantage for the two universities according to UTs website the rest of Texas  other public universities do not receive the same funding for a competitive edge PERIOD
This fund supports two universities while Texas State like other universities faces rapidly rising tuition costs underpaid and overworked faculty and struggles to fund the expansion of basic amenities like parking and courses PERIOD
This sort of selective funding demonstrates a dismissal of other Texas institutions and the education they provide as less valuable to the Texas Legislature despite all public institutions offering mostly the same service for the exact same goal a skilled and educated Texas as well as bastions of higher research PERIOD
At the bare minimum education should be as accessible as possible to all people because of its empowering nature PERIOD Moreover no person willing to learn should be denied an education simply because they cannot afford it PERIOD No Texan should be discounted because they do not attend the legislatures preferred institutions PERIOD
Beyond whatever merit of legacy UT and TAMU may have there is no practical reason to distribute this funding the way it has for much of Texas history PERIOD
While UT and TAMU are touted as the premiere Texas schools it is important to note that one cannot simply explain away this discrepancy with the notion that if a student wants to attend a school with more funding they should have worked harder in high school to attend these two universities PERIOD
Students reasoning for not attending those institutions extends beyond academic prestige PERIOD Some public universities have better specific major programs than UT or TAMU PERIOD Some students may need to attend school closer to home but do not live anywhere close to Austin or College Station PERIOD Affordability is always a factor or it can even be a choice of preference for no discernable reason PERIOD In no scenario does a students choice in public schooling justify receiving less of an opportunity than their contemporaries at a different Texas campus PERIOD
This is not to disparage UT TAMU or students of either university they are entitled to the best education they can get PERIOD The same generosity should be extended to all Texas students by the state legislature PERIOD The state does not gain anything from cheapening the education of the majority of its young people PERIOD If Texas really wants to disprove the stigma of indifference to education it will make equal access to education a priority PERIOD The PUF is a good place to set an initial example PERIOD It will make Texas and Texans stronger smarter and more equal PERIOD
