New Yorker sandwich on marbled rye from Ben  Esthers Vegan Jewish Deli PERIOD

Amidst the vegan options sprawled throughout Seattle a new addition comes to town in the form of a Jewish vegan deli known as Ben and Esthers PERIOD Ben and Esthers is a small West Coast franchise with locations in Oregon California and most recently Washington PERIOD

The deli is a ten minute walk from the Seattle University campus and features a wide variety of vegan options to choose from PERIOD The main showstopper of the deli appeared to be the bagels as customers indulged in a large range of bagels and spreads that were available PERIOD

Upon arrival there was a massive line that stretched outside with a bustling but relaxed and welcoming environment indoors PERIOD As 90s music played and bagels were made I got a chance to talk to some customers and hear what they thought about Ben and Esthers new inclusion to Seattle and what it meant for the vegan community PERIOD

Having a deli we can go to that has vegan options is great said Ben Shank who was waiting in line PERIOD

So far Ben and Esthers is garnering support from locals and tourists alike PERIOD

I really love the idea of having a place where people can go and enjoy good food that they cant enjoy somewhere else a place where the staff is friendly and treated well somewhere I can take family and friends to visit out of town Seattle local Jonathan Adams said PERIOD

Ben and Esthers has an impressively large menu PERIOD Above the menu theres a large subset of text that says OUR MENU IS  VEGAN followed by a smaller subset that says THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ARE NOT DERIVED FROM ANIMALS. the menu items ranged from traditionally meatheavy options like Bennys Brisket or the Steak  Eggs bagel sandwich to more traditional Jewish staples like the Noodle Kugel Potato Latke Hamentashen Challah and of the many favorites the potato knishes PERIOD The menu also included items from European and Mediterranean countries like the dolmas and the one that surprised me the most Borscht A beet soup that is derived from Russian cuisine PERIOD

Under the impressive menu were friendly staff that were enthusiastic eager to interact and serve customers and helpful PERIOD

Ben and Esthers treats their customers well supports animal rights related situations they have a good relationship with the homeless and obviously here they have a relationship with the Jewish community which is cool they also treat their workers well Joan Paluska an employee at the deli said PERIOD

Paluska sensed the excitement from customers during the hectic opening days of the Seattle location PERIOD

The original location is in Portland and apparently some people used to drive all the way over there to get their fix PERIOD And theres a pretty big vegan community here and same with the Jewish community and so I think for like the first month or so its going to be busier than normal Paluska said PERIOD

Many of the customers there also felt strongly that Ben and Esthers recent opening was an important addition to the vegan spots in Seattle PERIOD

There have been a number of restaurants in Seattle like Wayward Vegan cafe that have recently closed PERIOD Its becoming increasingly difficult to find vegan alternatives and thats one reason that I wanted to come out today its because I think its important for people who eat plantbased diets to support small businesses Adams said PERIOD

Adams mentioned environmental and ethical motivations for being vegan PERIOD

I just dont really like the idea of eating something that used to be alive Adams said PERIOD

Ben and Esthers inclusion in Seattle has created lines that wrap outside vegan sandwiches that turn heads and an ambience that encapsulates Seattles diversity PERIOD The deli makes for an unforgettable experience that makes customers keep coming back for more plantbased options and is an amazing way to support a small business PERIOD

Ben and Esthers is conveniently located in the heart of Capitol Hill which indirectly incentivizes students who may not be from Seattle and who are looking for more plantbased options a great opportunity to venture outside of the campus and eat locally PERIOD With the positive inclusive ambiance it will be a great place to get a quick bite when the line dies down of course PERIOD
