The April  Veterans Health Administration scandal catalyzed by a whistleblowers claims that at least  veterans died while waiting for medical appointments in a Phoenix hospital ostensibly shocked the American public PERIOD A statement released by the House Republicans after the explosion of media coverage about the corruption plaguing the veteran health system reads For generations weve made a commitment to veterans  those who bravely served to protect our way of life. the article later states that their efforts will not end until these heroesreceive the quality timely care theyve earned and deserve. despite the platitudes spouted by politicians that laud veteran services to our country the conditions publicized by the investigation show that rhetoric fails to translate into adequate policies for veteran care PERIOD

Despite the frequency with which politicians proclaim their devotion to veterans the actual legislation to substantiate their professed gratitude is lacking PERIOD The gradual degradation of the services offered to veterans becomes clearer when considering the actions taken by current politicians PERIOD These actions demonstrate that sincere efforts toward repairing veterans services only occur directly after scandals in vain attempts to appease the public  that is until the systems disastrous state is forgotten PERIOD

When the allegations of the deaths first surfaced legislators regarded the inability of the established programs to meet the needs of veterans as a surprise PERIOD They accordingly demanded change in emotionally charged speeches as more failures of the VA reached the public PERIOD However despite the absence of information specifically detailing the internal coverups and system inefficiency CNN and other media outlets reported the long delays for hospital appointments as early as January PERIOD

A similar course of events occurred in  when the Washington Post detailed the unsanitary conditions and consistent neglect that veterans faced at Walter Reed Army Medical Center while awaiting treatment PERIOD While articles brought the hospital and its management system into the spotlight the online news source Salon had been reporting on the inadequacy of the care offered at Walter Reed for two years PERIOD Military officials and politicians said they knew nothing of the systems internal corruption too PERIOD

The present infrastructure and efforts to improve veteran care seem particularly deficient given that the two scandals occurred close together in time PERIOD This indicates that genuine efforts to rectify the failures disclosed in  never occurred PERIOD Our elected leaders words are paradoxical when considering the structural failures of VA services PERIOD

One of the most telling signs of politicians unwillingness to legitimately improve veteran care occurred less than two months before the revelations about the Phoenix hospital PERIOD In February Senate Republicans blocked the passage of a bill that would have allocated  billion for the expansion of veteran health and education systems PERIOD It also called for the creation of new medical facilities to provide treatment for the over million soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan PERIOD Republicans justified their rejection of the bill by saying it would compromise the budget PERIOD Ironically the GOP was unconcerned with money when they howled for the War on Terror  the same war that resulted in millions of wounded soldiers who would ultimately need veteran care PERIOD

Republican legislators not only rejected bills that would improve veterans programs but also proposed ones that would cut funding to them PERIOD In  Rep PERIOD Michele Bachmann proposed a  PERIOD billion cut to veterans benefits PERIOD A year later Republicans refused to pass a bill that sought to restore national and state parks while providing veterans with jobs PERIOD Last year the House GOP passed a bill that ended food assistance for  veterans among other provisions PERIOD Republicans would likely follow suit in the future PERIOD

When former secretary of the VA Eric Shinseki resigned as a result of the scandal he left behind a program that sought to end the homelessness of all veterans by the end of  PERIOD While this goal now seems unrealistic  about  veterans still remain homeless  the efforts initiated by Shinseki have housed  veterans thus far PERIOD

Still obstacles remain PERIOD The Republicans who currently hold a majority in the House could potentially prohibit additional funding for the program question its efficacy and raise doubts about the exact uses of the money given to this program PERIOD Regardless of their budgetary concerns that they have treated veterans health care as a superfluous expense is shameful PERIOD Even if legislators manage to fix the current flaws in the hospital system  a seemingly unlikely task  hospital stays only offer a temporary solution PERIOD

The responsibility to rectify the situation rests with our elected officials PERIOD Sadly current bipartisan efforts reflect an unlikely hope PERIOD Despite the fact that politicians from both parties  many who are still in office  joined together to support the  Iraq Resolution these same politicians now seem to have forgotten that the men and women they sent overseas to supposedly preserve democracy are not dispensable PERIOD They risked their lives in service to our country and as such deserve better than our politicians shameful treatment PERIOD
