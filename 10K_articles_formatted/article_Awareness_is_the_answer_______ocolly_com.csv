This incident brings up many problems the student body and the university might be ignoring PERIOD We know the OSU police department does a good job of protecting the students and there has only been two attacks all semester but one attack is one too many PERIOD The walk from the Stout Hall parking lot where the incident occurred to Drummond Hall is a dark and lonely one  weaving through buildings that create unlit and unavoidable alleyways PERIOD The fact that no police official saw the attack in such a vulnerable location means OSUPD security is not sufficient PERIOD



Also students must report crimes committed against them as soon as possible PERIOD If Fridays victim had used the blue emergency phone that is next to the parking lot OSUPD may have caught the attacker that night PERIOD Giving the attacker the extra days may have saved him a conviction PERIOD



OSU boasts one of the lowest crime rates in the Big  which might give the students here a false sense of security PERIOD A sex crime had not occurred since September but that did not stop the incident from occurring Friday morning and it will not stop it from happening again PERIOD Students need to be aware of what goes on around them PERIOD We can have a police officer on every corner but if we are not willing to watch out for ourselves and each other we will never fully eliminate assaults PERIOD
