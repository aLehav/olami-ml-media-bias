Women debate armed defense of abortion clinics Jen Sullivan Daily Staff

Seattle Radical Women and UW Campus Radical Women urge feminists to defend abortion clinics with weapons.Abortion clinics have been attacked and threatened repeatedly by armed rightwing fundamentalists PERIOD said Margaret Viggiani Radical Women member and a UW ticket office employee.The Radical Women claim that if women stand up for their rights and are prepared to defend themselves they will stop the violence threatened by others PERIOD said Helen Gilbert Radical Women member.In a debate last Monday in the HUB the two groups said women can choose between organized armed self defense or a return to the days of forced motherhood coat hangers and back alley abortions PERIOD claims Ann Slater Radical Women member.The two groups said a womans role in society must change from that of the protected to that of the protector PERIOD said Viggiani PERIOD If a woman defends herself without the interference of the police it is seen as violence which is inexcusable.She went through the proper channels by calling the policeWhen you rely on someone else like Simpson did you are playing into a sexist stereotype that women cant take care of themselvesOur elected Democratic officials along with Republicans and NeoNazis are selling womens rights down the riverThese officials who when we elected them claimed to be staunch supporters of womens rights are making us the scapegoats.If you dont have access to an abortion and get pregnant you have become a dispensable part of the workforceFor having this ability to become dispensable you are worthless and paid less PERIOD This treatment is what both Republicans and Democrats want whats good for business.Taking up arms would be a grassroots community movement led by democratically motivated votersSince the right to an abortion is a constitutional right federal money should be given to protect this movement.At the meeting a general question asked was If we take up arms are we adding to the violenceJust ask any antiabortion terrorist PERIOD Theyll tell you that guns and violence work PERIOD What these terrorists wont say is that their tactics only succeed until the victim fights back and shows that she too is willing to use guns.These same people know that if they walk into a clinic with the hope of taking lives and those lives are armed the violence will stopWe even had some female community members standing up and yelling Yes we do have the right to defend our reproductive systemsNot everyone has to carry a gun but all women have a right to defend themselves and to have an abortion.When I first heard about the movement I was a little unsurePersonally I dont think I could carry a gun but I fully support the cause PERIOD
