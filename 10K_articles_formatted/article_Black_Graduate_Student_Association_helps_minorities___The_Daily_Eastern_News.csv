When she graduated in May her father gave her two optionsget a job or go to graduate school PERIOD Unsure if she was ready to jump into the workforce she decided graduate school was her best choice PERIOD

Sherry Gunn president of the Black Graduate Student Association said even though she was unsure about what to study at graduate school she knew she enjoyed the aspects of college and helping fellow minorities PERIOD This is why she chose to get her masters degree in student affairs and works in the Gateway office PERIOD

I wanted to make sure that I was there to promote an opportunity for minorities Gunn said PERIOD

BGSA is an organization dedicated to helping AfricanAmerican graduate students and those who are thinking about pursing graduate studies PERIOD BGSA has been a program at Eastern for at least five years Gunn said PERIOD

Gunn said students within the organization are able to discuss the challenges stresses and issues minority students may face while being in graduate school PERIOD In any given class there may be only two or three minority graduate students PERIOD Gunn said there are approximately  black graduate students on Easterns campus PERIOD

Everyone needs a place to vent our issues may be different from everyone elses Gunn said PERIOD

BGSA is also a national program with the members often participating in conferences and getting professional development skills as well as networking Gunn said PERIOD

The program will help students figure out when to apply for graduate school or give them information about graduate school if it is something they may want to pursue PERIOD

BGSA can also assist students with the graduate record exam if it is needed PERIOD Gunn said students sometimes miss out on getting a graduate assistantship because they apply too late PERIOD

Gunn said one of the hardest parts about any student being in graduate school or being in a graduate assistantship is finding where to fit in while being on and off campus PERIOD

As graduate assistants they are still students but they often work on campus PERIOD Therefore going out to any of the bars in Charleston is somewhat frowned upon Gunn said PERIOD

Many of the students in BGSA are also in Graduate Student Advisory Council but the two organizations are different PERIOD
