As provided on the KrakowWitkin Gallerys website Broughel was born in Hartford Conn PERIOD and has been making art since the 1970s PERIOD After studying at various art institutions including the Whitney Museum in New York City Broughel began teaching and has taught art at universities including Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology PERIOD Requiem came to fruition in the 1980s when Broughel first began learning about the witch trials that occurred in Connecticut some just a few miles from the home she grew up in  PERIOD

Broughel was appalled that these events were not taught in Connecticut schools PERIOD Further the trials werent even common knowledge among lifelong residents PERIOD Motivated by her anger Broughel sought to uncover the mystery of who the accused really were and bring light to the events that occurred in her home state PERIOD

The objects in the collection many of which being altered household items serve as portraits of the accused PERIOD Each item represents aspects of the persons life and the socalled evidence that was used to convict them PERIOD

In her artists statement on the KrakowWitkin Gallery website Broughel explains that she explored dozens of different sources to piece together the lives of the accused but found that most of the documents were biased toward superstition making it impossible to get a clear understanding of what had really occurred and most importantly of who the individuals really were who had their lives so viciously cut short and destroyed  PERIOD In the end the pieces were based on the court transcripts of each case which she found to be the only factual accounts of the events PERIOD

Requiem meaning an act or token of remembrance is an apt title for the exhibition PERIOD Each work includes the name of the victim it is created in honor of and a sentence detailing the crime they were convicted of PERIOD The sentences are harrowing highlighting the senselessness of their deaths PERIOD Mary Johnson was created in  and although at first glance it may look like nothing but a mop it carries the weight of the accusations held against her PERIOD

In her artist statement Broughel saysRequiem is a modest attempt to pay homage at long last to the real flesh and blood women and men whose lives were lost so tragically to a toxic combination of superstition greed and malice and viewers can see that Requiem does just that  PERIOD
