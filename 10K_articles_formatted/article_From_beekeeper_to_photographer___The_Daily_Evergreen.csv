What got you started

I used to be a rock climber PERIOD We would kind of just shoot each other goofing off climbing PERIOD What really got me started was working as a commercial beekeeper and needing an outlet because Id work six seven hour days PERIOD So Id bring my camera and just document my life PERIOD And that turned into a large project because I was a beekeeper for like three years and then that turned into other things to shoot not just bees PERIOD This is kind of a reflection of those interests elevating the everyday to something a little bit more. what is your inspiration for photos

I used to do construction and so I wanted to showcase what its like and what the people are like that do the work that goes unnoticed. do you have any funny stories to tell from shooting

Most of these photos I was wearing American flag spandex tights. rachel is the Roots editor for the spring  semester PERIOD She started working for The Daily Evergreen in the fall of  and previously served as editorinchief.. PERIOD
