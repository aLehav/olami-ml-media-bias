We spent a little time on Monday afternoon exploring the Internet for entertaining Web sites PERIOD While there was a lot more out there to trudge through than we had expected to find we can at least recommend these sites for the bored or those in need of a break from homework PERIOD

 For every test under the sun go to httpwww.emode.com or httpthespark.com where you can find out if you are greedy or discover the color of your aura among the more innocent of the tests PERIOD

 If you are looking for a list of Web sites to fill the void in your life try httpwww.bored.com or httpwww.portalofevil.com PERIOD

 If youre looking for a game to get addicted to try httpwww.snood.com or httpwww.ydkj.com PERIOD

 For fun ecards try httpwww.activegrams.com or httpwww.bluemountain.com PERIOD

Its still a listinprogress but it should keep you busy until we have more free time to find other sites this could be a long time so get good and tired of the sites PERIOD
