I was talking to a student on campus recently whotold me something interesting PERIOD

Their professor had told them that they shouldnt worry too much about padding their resume with volunteer work because the officials doing the review dont really care if youre a good person or not. this of course was just a little dark humor but there is some validity to it PERIOD

Volunteer work makes you an awesome person and I feel confident to speculate that awesome people are more likely to be accepted into graduate programs PERIOD

Also its always nice to have volunteer and community benefit activities under your belt for applications and scholarship inquiry PERIOD

But nothing sets you apart from your peers like reallife experience in your field of study PERIOD

Internships research projects and jobs are the key to an outstanding graduate program application PERIOD They will also unquestionably make the difference when you begin applying for jobs in the future PERIOD

Yes volunteering at an animal shelter makes you a really great person PERIOD But unless a preveterinary animal science major you should put most of your effort toward seeking out internships in your field of study that will help you stand out from the crowd come application review time PERIOD

Its the internships and jobs that are going to hold the most weight when it comes time to start applying for graduate school PERIOD

Plan accordingly PERIOD
