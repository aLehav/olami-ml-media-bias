On Thursday evening the Native American Student Association NASA held its first event of Native American Heritage Month PERIOD In an interactive exercise students attending the event learned about the  years of colonization that the Wabanaki people faced at the hands of Europeans in the land now known as Maine PERIOD NASA leaders hoped that this event would be just the beginning of Bowdoin students deeply engaging with Native American histories and NASA events throughout November and beyond PERIOD

The event was facilitated by Wabanaki REACH an organization that supports the selfdetermination of Wabanaki people through Restoration Engagement Advocacy Change and Healing REACH PERIOD Guided by Heather Augustine a member of the Elsipogtog First Nation and community organizer and REACH board member Penthea Burns  students walked through the history of the forcible acquisition of Wabanaki land by physically standing on a cloth map laid out on the second floor of the Russwurm African American Center PERIOD As the story of colonization unfolded the map representing Wabanaki territory gradually became more splintered and smaller in size PERIOD

NASA coleaders Amory Malin  and Kami Atcitty  wanted the first event of Native American Heritage Month to center around Wabanaki history and the land on which the College rests PERIOD

Coming into this month we knew that we wanted to be able to connect and talk about specifically Wabanaki history just because it is so important because this is where we are Malin said PERIOD Obviously Native land is everywhere PERIOD But we wanted to be able to really nail down this connection. participants also learned about broken land treaties outbreaks of Old World diseases the forced removal of children from their communities to Indian boarding schools and other hardships that Wabanaki people have continually faced since first contact PERIOD Wabanaki REACH facilitators and students reflecting on the map exercise spoke about how significantly the history of colonization impact Native peoples and lands and the need for change PERIOD

Weve wanted to reframe Native American Heritage Month at Bowdoin around this idea of what it means to be Native American in the twenty-first century and how Native peoples continuouslyespecially the Wabanaki Confederacycontinue to do so Atcitty said PERIOD The purpose of engagement and community events is to bring awareness around a lot of these issues that Native peoples face today and also just bringing these voices and perspectives to the table which are so often marginalized within Western society. through their upcoming events this month and beyond NASA leaders hope to amplify Indigenous perspectives and deepen awareness across the Bowdoin community PERIOD Upcoming NASA events include a POC in STEAM gathering this Thursday conversations with Penobscot leaders about sovereignty legislations Indian Taco night and a book display of Indigenous authors in collaboration with the HawthorneLongfellow Library PERIOD

A lot of our events are about community engagement and about teaching and about facilitating a larger conversation because we need to PERIOD Because we need to bring recognition because people need to know whose land theyre on Malin said PERIOD Hopefully if we can create a space where everyone understands these broader colonial contexts then we can create a more aware community and more Native people would feel welcome in spaces like Bowdoin. advertisement
