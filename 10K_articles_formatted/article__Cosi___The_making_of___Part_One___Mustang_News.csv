By the third rehearsal of Cosi the first act of the show was almost completely blocked PERIOD Blocking is the process of staging the actors giving them a chance to map out their movements in relation to other actors and the scene theyre in PERIOD

Schnupp took a very handson approach in his blocking guiding actors to show them exactly how he wanted them to move PERIOD After talking through the movement the actors ran through the scene several times PERIOD This allowed them to work the movements into their memories PERIOD

However no runthrough is the same PERIOD Each time an actor goes through a scene small adjustments are made PERIOD Sometimes theyre suggestions by Schnupp and other times they are deliberate choices the performer feels would fit their character PERIOD

Its not all serious business though PERIOD There is chemistry between the student actors PERIOD

During the short breaks between scenes they often talked and laughed PERIOD Mistakes were brushed off with humor PERIOD The camaraderie gives the ensemble a cohesive feeling helpingtheir performance in the long run PERIOD

Lewis will be performed by math and theatre sophomore Garrett Lamoureux PERIOD Previously seen in Black Comedy and The Crucible Lamoureux is most looking forward to working with fellow students PERIOD

Its such a fun show environment Lamoureux said PERIOD I am looking forward to working with everyone the cast our stage managers Al. i hope the actors will develop a good understanding of character a deepening of their craft what it means to work as an ensemble and I hope they experience the joy of performing in front of an audience Schnupp said PERIOD
