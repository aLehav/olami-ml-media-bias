 Courtney tells me in a breath of light staccato laughs PERIOD  Courtney twirls a coil of her blonde hair and tugs at the cuffs of her leather jacket PERIOD 

 Courtney explains to me PERIOD 

 I laugh PERIOD 

 Courtney smirks and exhales an innocent laugh PERIOD 

Although Courtney loves the grit and grime of style and the rebels who execute it it is somewhat hard to believe when her explanations are followed by strings of nervous girly laughter and complimented by an innocent smile of perfect teeth PERIOD Yet when I ask Courtney about her favorite pieces I learn a little bit more about how grunge influences her daily PERIOD

 Courtney flashes her perfect set of teeth and unapologetically continues 

 I laugh and change the subject PERIOD 



 I point to Courtneys white tanktop that shows the plastered outline of a lady looking outwards without pupils but with a set of perfect white teeth that are cradled by a red saturated mouth PERIOD

 Courtney humbly tells me with a trace of doubt PERIOD

 I tell her PERIOD



 I interject PERIOD

 Courtney laughs and tugs at a stray braid almost hidden in her mess of blonde hair PERIOD
