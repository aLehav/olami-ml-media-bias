With two preseason scrimmages under their belt MorettCurtiss believes the team is ready PERIOD

Weve had an outstanding preseason MorettCurtiss said PERIOD We had some bumps and bruises along the way with a few of the players but it seems like were getting everybody healthy right now heading into this very challenging weekend. morettCurtiss mentioned that in order for the team to start off the season right against Duke each player must focus on their team chemistry and discipline PERIOD

Opening against such strong teams gives you a purpose to your preseason MorettCurtiss said PERIOD Were going to expect a lot of versatility from players that may have to play out of position at times. among these key players will be junior Madison Hutson a twotime Academic AllBig Ten honoree who believes that the younger players are open to the changes PERIOD

Were a giant family we work hard everyday and no matter who you go to you can talk to them Hutson said PERIOD Youre always welcome no matter what the situation youre in and its something we always strive for

Its going to be a hectic game in some regards were going to throw the ball away but were going to work really hard to get it back MorettCurtiss said PERIOD Hopefully well settle and be a little bit more composed and more structured as the season goes on PERIOD Its great to have that challenge right away. on offense MorettCurtiss focus is for the squad to be quick aggressive and always attacking PERIOD

Last years team had more than  shots than their opponents setting up a high offensive expectation this year led by returning players in Hutson senior midfielder Madison Morano and sophomore Anna Simon PERIOD

I think thats whats going to make it more difficult for our opponents because they dont really know this team MorettCurtiss said PERIOD They dont really know the players so much PERIOD People arent going to know what to expect when we take the field. morettCurtiss also praised Simon and said her game has only gotten better since last season PERIOD

It looks like her shot has gotten harder which we didnt really know was possible MorettCurtiss said PERIOD Shes really that premiere corner shooter for us and in the field we try to get her up a little bit more to get in the midfield. on the defensive side of things MorettCurtiss favors Hutson and freshman goalkeeper Brie Barraco as the leaders PERIOD

Hut is really the anchor in the backfield being our communicator along with Brie Barraco who has just been outstanding so far this year as well MorettCurtiss said PERIOD That communication from Brie and Hut is so important for that reassurance to the players. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
