After multiple pitches to publishing companies Phil Shore took matters into his own hands and selfpublished his first book PERIOD

Major League Lacrosse is far from the most popular American sport PERIOD Phil Shore  chose to shine a light on the beloved activity often swept aside by mainstream sports media in his first book released June  PERIOD

Titled Major League Life Why Major League Lacrosse Players Coaches and Fans Share a Passion for a League that Often Goes Overlooked the book touches on each MLL team chapter by chapter PERIOD

The selfpublished book is now available for purchase only on Amazon.com in paperback and Kindle versions PERIOD

During the research process in summer  Shore traveled to six different cities to attend individual different games and interview players and superfans PERIOD He first stopped by Boston for the Cannons first game of the season on June  PERIOD Then he went to Baltimore Maryland Dallas Texas Denver Colorado Hempstead New York and Atlanta Georgia PERIOD

Shore began brainstorming the idea for his book between late  and early  PERIOD In January the following year he and his wife Brooke began to plan how they were going to execute his concept and travel schedule PERIOD

It was my thirtieth birthday and my wife said to me If we are going to do this there is no better time than now he said in a phone interview from Culpepper Virginia PERIOD We started making plans on how and when I was going to different cities and if our schedule matches up. shore played for the Emerson mens lacrosse team through his Emerson tenure and became lacrosse captain his senior year before graduating with a Print  Multimedia Journalism degree nine years ago PERIOD After commencement he returned to his hometown of Toms River New Jersey and did freelance reporting for US Lacrosse Magazine and the New England Lacrosse Journal PERIOD He also began working with the lacrosse coaching staff at Toms River High School East thena move that helped him decide to get his teaching certification PERIOD

I figured that with a teaching certification I can do all of the things that I enjoy said Shore PERIOD It will allow me to write it will allow me to coach and it will allow me to make an impact in my community. shore is currently an eighthgrade language arts and journalism teacher at Parkside Middle School in Manassa Va PERIOD He also coaches junior varsity boys lacrosse at nearby Freedom High School in South Riding Va PERIOD

Jeremy Peterson Shores assistant coach at Freedom High School said Shore has a clear passion for lacrosse and teaching PERIOD

It is really obvious that coaching comes naturally to him Peterson said PERIOD Not just how he teaches lacrosse but how he is with the players PERIOD He is just really good with the boys. peterson was one of the first people to buy Shores book PERIOD He said he read a couple of chapters so far and enjoyed them PERIOD

Its really good so far and I can almost hear him when I am reading it he said PERIOD Its like a friend is telling you a story. during the professional lacrosse seasons Shore writes for the New England Lacrosse Journal once a month and for US Lacrosse Magazine twice a week PERIOD

In the book Shore wanted to give lacrosse fans and players a space to spotlight their sacrifices and passion for the sport PERIOD He said he wanted to write a book that all sports fans could enjoy and share stories that are usually overlooked PERIOD

Shore said players have to make sacrifices because the sport they play doesnt make them a lot of money PERIOD

These players sacrifice summers and work extra jobs even though professional players dont make a lot of money Shore said PERIOD Even though its a small community there are superfans that absolutely love it so why do these players and fans care so much about a league that isnt part of the popular culture

While freelancing in  Shore had the idea of traveling to all six MLL teams and interacting with the superfans in each city PERIOD

I do all of my freelancing work over the phone or over email so I really wanted to get my face in front of people he said PERIOD

Senior Journalism and Sports Communication major Tyler Englander met Shore during his internship at Major League Lacrosse in July  while watching the MLL allstars game in Annapolis Maryland  PERIOD

I respect his passion for the game of lacrosse because at a national level it is a very niche sport Englander said in a phone interview from Connecticut PERIOD It doesnt have the larger media attention so I respect his passion and love for the game especially now because he wrote a whole book on lacrosse. shore said it was not easy to find MLL super fans but he eventually found one per lacrosse team PERIOD He contacted the public relations director of every MLL team to find people who attended each game and displayed a passion for the sport PERIOD

I wanted to find a super fan for each city which meant I had to reach out to the PR people of each team Shore said PERIOD I already had a Denver superfan planned out because he is pretty famous in the lacrosse community but everywhere else I wasnt really sure who those super fans were. shore aspired to interview players who were fans of the league growing up PERIOD He said he wanted to get the perspective of fans who are now players for the team PERIOD

In Boston there were three players who were fans as children and now are on the other side Shore said PERIOD James Fahey Nick Marrocco and Marty Bowes PERIOD Those guys all grew up going to the lacrosse games as kids and now they are on the other side which is a cool thing to think about. shores personal favorite part of his book is the story of Denvers goalie Kai Iwamoto the first Japanese MLL athlete in the United States PERIOD

Iwamotos story is the epitome of these guys chasing their passion Shore said PERIOD Not only did he travel from Japan to the U.S to play lacrosse and he became the first Japanese MLL player he spent three years at open tryouts before he finally earned a spot on the roster in . shore submitted his pitch to multiple publishing companies and after being turned down he decided to selfpublish the book PERIOD Then he became his own editor cover designer and publishing staff PERIOD

This book was my vision that I had because no publisher said yes I want a major league lacrosse book so I had to make sacrifices in order to make my vision come true Shore said PERIOD There is something beautiful in creating this book on your own. shore said he found that the most accessible way to selfpublish was through Amazons free Kindle Direct Publishing PERIOD The program allows selfpublishing authors to use it for free PERIOD

I had to do everything Shore said PERIOD I researched how to do my own cover and I learned how to format a book PERIOD It was a challenge at first but after I learned it became pretty easy. shore said his book ranks first in the category of new release lacrosse books on Amazon PERIOD

Success is pretty relative to everybody but Im pretty happy with the feedback that Im getting Shore said PERIOD

Shore said he has ideas for books he would like to tackle in the future but right now he wants to appreciate his recent success before he starts planning his next project PERIOD

In the immediate future I do want to enjoy this accomplishment first before I start a new project Shore said PERIOD I want to wait for more reactions and gain some momentum before I execute any of the few lacrosse ideas PERIOD Right now I just want to enjoy my summer with my wife and my dog and become a better teacher. correction Date07072020  p.m PERIOD Four geographic details about Shores hometown and research process were corrected PERIOD
