James Johnson has been one of the goto shooters all season long for the Bobcats PERIOD Even when he missed his first six shots Monday night his teammates kept giving him the ball PERIOD

He eventually found his old reliable stroke from the perimeter PERIOD

I have all the confidence in myself said Johnson who finished with  points all in the second half PERIOD When I shoot the ball I feel like its going in PERIOD Coach just told me to keep shooting and luckily they went down at a big time. johnson broke a 48all tie when he shot a 3pointer from the left wing and then gave the Bobcats a twopossession lead when he made another shot from the top of the key as the shot clock expired PERIOD

There was no pressure because the shot clock was running down and I knew I had to shoot it  everybody knew I had to shoot it Johnson said PERIOD I just had to take my time and make the shot. and he did PERIOD

Johnson has started every game for QU since his arrival and he moved past Kason Mims for consecutive starts for a Bobcat playing in his eighty-ninth straight game PERIOD

Hes a really hard worker a really toughminded kid a really confident kid and he just has incredible selfbelief Quinnipiac head coach Tom Moore said PERIOD Im really proud of that streak. johnson and the rest of the Bobcats found a way to hold Pioneers Shane Gibson the leagues thirdleading scorer to three points PERIOD

James Johnson did a real good job on him in the first half Moore said PERIOD In the second half because they were weaving so much it was a cumulative effort for all our guards. justin Rutty scored  points and brought down seven rebounds for the Bobcats   NEC who remain in a thirdplace tie with Wagner in the conference PERIOD Lance Brown added  points and led the team with eight rebounds PERIOD
