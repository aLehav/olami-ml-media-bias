Actor Malcolm Callender gazed upon the entrance of Theatre  where handprints of actors lay etched into the sidewalk to create New York Citys very own walk of fame PERIOD He stepped into the space once inhabited by former gangsters movie stars and musicians PERIOD He was prepared to take part in a weekly meeting with his theater company but little did he know the theater was at risk of permanently shutting down PERIOD

You would never think that its gonna close based on the energy people bring to the space PERIOD It was always something I was pushing to the side of my head because I didnt want it to be true Callender said PERIOD When I walk into the theater I feel like I am home  home in the sense of being around people on the same wavelength as me PERIOD We choose to come to that home and thats what makes it so special. unless owners Lorcan Otway and Genie Otway can raise . million  St PERIOD Marks Place  home to Theatre  a tavern and a crime museum  is in danger of being sold at a May  auction PERIOD COVID19 restrictions that prevented the theater from operating for a time caused financial hardships PERIOD

Lorcan Otway had to take out a . million mortgage from Hirshmark Capital a real estate firm refinance the space and cover the expenses caused by his brothers misappropriation of  from the theater PERIOD State COVID19 policies then forced him to temporarily close the theater PERIOD Maverick Real Estate Partners another firm purchased the debt during the pandemic buying the right to collect the money the Otway family originally owed Hirshmark Capital PERIOD According to Otway the debt has since risen to . million  the firm immediately began to charge penalty interest PERIOD

The firm has also closed  million worth of debt transactions with more than  individual investments PERIOD It also lost a threeyear long battle to foreclose on an apartment in November   a building owned by a Holocaust survivor PERIOD Multiple individuals from the firm declined or did not respond to requests for comment PERIOD

Otway said that two anonymous philanthropists pledged  million and  million conditioned on the theater becoming a nonprofit PERIOD The theater recently obtained taxexempt status and is now considered a public charity PERIOD However Lorcan Otway said that not having that status while they were trying to find donations put them at a disadvantage PERIOD He also mentioned going through multiple lenders one of whom pulled out of the deal last minute PERIOD

One of the lenders called our lawyer and said they had been threatened by Maverick PERIOD The lawyer informed the court and the judges response was I dont intend to get down into those weeds Lorcan Otway said PERIOD Those weeds are taking everything I had built  two generations of my familys history  leaving us homeless and broke after what very possibly is criminal behavior by a company practically profiteering off a recognized emergency. east Village activist Kenneth Toglia created a petition that garnered over  signatures urging individuals to help preserve the theater and to support a GoFundMe raising money to pay off the debt PERIOD Toglia also organized a rally on March  outside of City Hall encouraging attendees to show their support by dressing up as characters from the theater PERIOD

You can feel the theater and the vibes of everyone who has passed through there PERIOD Its almost like a school or a temple of theater itself Toglia said PERIOD Its always been a shining jewel for the community that so many people have had to cut their teeth in the theater PERIOD The whole culture of live theater is important now too with everything being on the internet PERIOD For people to see live actors on a stage  theres something magical about that. before Lorcan Otways father bought the theater in  it began as two tenements that came together to create a speakeasy during the Prohibition Era PERIOD Later the space premiered Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown before it moved to Broadway and has served as a space for rising actors like Billy Crystal who worked as an usher there PERIOD During the 1970s and 80s the theater was a film revival house where individuals could watch classic movies PERIOD

Amy Berkov an assistant professor at the City University of New York contributed to the GoFundMe PERIOD She recalled having one of her favorite New Years Eve outings at Theatre  where she watched a double feature of classic movies PERIOD

At midnight the movies stopped and they served champagne in plastic champagne glasses and brought around trays with pigs in a blanket hors doeuvres PERIOD Or thats how I remember it Berkov said PERIOD I was completely charmed and always appreciated it that they provided a lowkey venue for those of us who wouldnt be caught dead in Times Square. andrew Berman the executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Village Preservation believes that New York could have done more to support Theatre  during the pandemic PERIOD He noted that the theaters struggles reflect a trend of independent theaters and cultural institutions in the area being forced to close down and he emphasized the need for small cultural institutions to thrive beyond cityowned sites PERIOD

In  the Sunshine Cinema met its demise after succumbing to financial struggles resulting from rising rent prices PERIOD Other historic movie theaters throughout the city have followed suit including Manhattans last singlescreen theater the Paris Theatre which permanently closed in  PERIOD

Theatre  embodies everything that we value and seek to honor and preserve in our neighborhoods Berman said PERIOD Its not only a wonderfully wellpreserved historic building but its a multifaceted cultural institution that contributes so much to the vitality character and dynamism of our neighborhoods. berman said if the Otway family loses the building the new owners could demolish it and erase what many view as a vital part of New York Citys history and landscape PERIOD Since Theatre  draws people from all over the world people may feel less inclined to visit St PERIOD Marks Place or the East Village without its presence according to Berman PERIOD

Ive often described the Otways as having at least nine lives if not more Berman said PERIOD It certainly feels as though this is their last chance because the situation has never been more serious than it is now and the odds are stacked against them so they need a miracle. contact Adrianna Nehme at emailprotected PERIOD
