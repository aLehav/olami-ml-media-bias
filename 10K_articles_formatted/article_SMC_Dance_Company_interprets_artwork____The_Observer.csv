Members of the Saint Marys Dance Company interpreted paintings through dance in the Moreau Center for the Arts on Friday PERIOD

Senior Bethany Tabor choreographed two dances in response to Wall to Wall a piece by Ann Tarantino on display in the gallery PERIOD Tabor junior Taylor CouillardRodak sophomore Jing Zhu senior Catherine Cislo and senior Alysha Zemanek performed the work PERIOD

I think Id title it Contact Tabor said PERIOD The way the dance moved  its sort of formally the same as the paintings on the wall. tabor an art history and philosophy major said she designed the compositions with Tarantinos lonely figures in unknown landscapes in mind PERIOD The black fireworks of paint Tarantino applied directly on the gallery walls compelled Tabor also a dance minor to turn the work she has been doing for her senior composition into a handson experience she said PERIOD

I am writing my senior comp on dance in the art space Tabor said PERIOD A recent trend in art galleries is to have dance companies come in and dance among the art work PERIOD Its a new phenomenon in art right now and Im researching that. tabor said her advisor art professor Tiffany Bidler believed Tarantinos paintings could potentially enhance Tabors project PERIOD

Were all part of the Saint Marys Dance Company and were dancing in a piece together for the show in February and this is loosely based off of what weve done in rehearsals for that Tabor said PERIOD

Senior Katie Haemmerle said she enjoyed the piece because it portrayed themes that appeal to her particular aesthetic preferences PERIOD

The artist on her description said that it was meant to convey sort of loneliness isolation and then sea life Haemmerle said PERIOD Im usually drawn to literature art poetry anything with that sort of thing so I liked it in that sense. beyond the emotional connotations Haemmerle said she believes dance itself offers an unusual medium to communicate ideas PERIOD

A lot of people will perceive art as being something stationary on the wall Haemmerle said PERIOD I think this is a good way to express that art and dance can be combined and integrated to form something that is not just on the wall PERIOD It provides movement to something stationary. haemmerle said she felt the movement of the dancers reflected the intended movement of Tarantinos paintings PERIOD

I dont know if Im interpreting the dance correctly but the way the dancers formed the cluster and then spread out  I thought that was a good way to represent whats on the wall with the paintings and how theyre spread out Haemmerle said PERIOD They created white space with movement which is interesting

In fiction but more so in poetry white space has purpose PERIOD I feel like if you look at the wall it does the same thing PERIOD It creates that isolation and the dance I thought expressed the exact same thing. contact Rebecca ONeil at emailprotected
