If there are two things that do not mix they are clean drinking water and oil pipelines  specifically oil pipelines subject to extremely lenient environmental reviews PERIOD The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline by Energy Transfer is the most recent form of injustice in a long and complex history between Native Americans and the U.S PERIOD government yet there continues to be a lack of nationwide attention and mainstream media coverage PERIOD

Set to carry oil from the Bakken region of North Dakota to Patoka Illinois Energy Transfers pipeline jeopardizes the cultural and physical wellbeing of Native American communities situated on the Missouri River PERIOD It surprised many when the U.S PERIOD Army Corps of Engineers approved the pipeline but it was later revealed that loopholes enabled the project to evade proper environmental assessment PERIOD Under the Nationwide Permit  the pipeline was viewed as several hundred waterways instead of what it really is one 1172mile oilcarrying pipeline PERIOD

Extending across the North and South Dakota border the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation faces dire consequences should crude oil spill from the pipeline PERIOD With a plan to transport  barrels of oil a day any kind of Dakota access leak would cause monumental damage to the tribes water supply PERIOD On average pipeline spills   whether crude oil gasoline or liquid natural gas  occur approximately  times a year across the U.S PERIOD

Members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation have noted that the oil could pollute not only drinking water but also decimate plants with great cultural significance such as sage
mouse bean and buffalo berries PERIOD The proposed construction route for the pipeline has already  desecrated Sioux burial grounds this past summer PERIOD

While the project is more than halfway completed Native Americans environmentalists and Midwestern landowners have expressed their anger at this injustice PERIOD The Sacred Stones protest camp has seen the largest assembly of Native American tribal representatives in over a quartercentury PERIOD Campaigns such as Rezpect Our Water have worked to bring together these different groups with support from celebrities like Shailene Woodley and Leonardo DiCaprio PERIOD Tribal activists have also written letters to government officials and hosted a number of protests including a 500mile run PERIOD

Recently Sioux tribe leader Dave Archambault II testified to the United Nations Human Rights Council on the pipeline calling upon all parties to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. archambault highlighted the U.S PERIOD governments infringement upon the tribes sovereign rights a sentiment not unlike one expressed by indigenous peoples during the period of European colonization in the Americas PERIOD

Such activism has not stopped Energy Transfers private security however from attacking demonstrators with dogs pepper spray and zip ties PERIOD Both pregnant women and young
children have experienced injury PERIOD Even with proof of these assaults the protesters not the heads of Energy Transfer are facing punishment PERIOD Amy Goodman an awardwinning journalist who shared videos of the attacks is facing criminal charges for trespassing which she claims is an attack on free press PERIOD

Even with such efforts the protests have yet to garner as much nationwide attention as they should PERIOD Three major broadcast networks ABC CBS and NBC have aired only one report on the protests since they began in April with CBS Morning news giving only  words on the matter during a  a.m PERIOD broadcast in September PERIOD MSNBC commentator Lawrence ODonnell only delivered commentary on the issue once during a broadcast on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

Even without mainstream coverage social media has played an integral part in spreading awareness of the risks tied to the pipeline PERIOD With hashtags like NoDAPL and the spread of slogans like Water is Life and For Future Generations Native voices are louder now than they have ever been PERIOD It is imperative their voices and struggle continue to be heard whether through retweeting sharing Facebook posts or signing petitions PERIOD In the words of Sioux chairman Archambault the pipeline presents a threat to our lands our sacred sites and our waters and the people who are affected must be heard. kelsey Lawson is a sophomore in the School of Foreign Service PERIOD She is a member of the Native American Student Council PERIOD
