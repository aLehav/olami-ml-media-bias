There are some parts of the trip here that I would gleefully trade away for a day or two at home but none as much as Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Oct PERIOD  began as a completely normal day but thats how days are supposed to begin before all hell breaks loose PERIOD



I returned home after a day of midterm exams and took a nap PERIOD When I woke up I felt like I had been hit by a truck PERIOD I knew I was sick but I had to finish reading a book for one of my classes and write a paper on it PERIOD

This I knew was not a feat I could accomplish under heavy doses of medication PERIOD

Therefore I decided to push through and finish the paper before I fell asleep PERIOD

The next morning was even worse PERIOD I woke up tried to force down some breakfast and in my feverish stupor I attempted to go to school PERIOD

Thankfully my host mom was awake and able to tell me to go back to bed PERIOD I slept until four that evening before waking up and realizing I needed antibiotics and badly PERIOD

I called my study abroad office and they set up an appointment for me that I needed to leave for almost immediately PERIOD Stupid feverinfested me figured I could handle walking to the metro and then finding the hospital PERIOD

After I got off the metro to switch lines I had to sit down and put my head between my knees to avoid passing out in front of a bunch of random strangers halfway to my destination PERIOD

I then regained strength and vision and was able to gingerly pick my way to the next line I needed to be on PERIOD

At this point all I could do was pray PERIOD

I finally got off at the metro stop and a fiveminute walk to the hospital ended up taking  minutes because I got so turned around PERIOD

I collapsed into a chair in the international office and when I heard the sweet sound of the English language I knew I had made it PERIOD The first doctor immediately diagnosed me with strep throat and sent me off to get meds PERIOD Little did I know this was only the beginning PERIOD

I woke up the next morning running a fever of  PERIOD

I took a second dose of meds and fell back asleep only to wake up again still running a high fever of  PERIOD

Realizing the meds I was taking were not strong enough back to the hospital I went PERIOD

This time I got to see a general doctor instead of one who spoke English PERIOD

The second doctor now affectionately known as my hero immediately gave me a shot because my tonsils were so swollen and I had trouble breathing so he prescribed me the good stuff PERIOD

Now taking three different types of medication I finally felt back to my old self although those two days were a blur of taking whatever medicine I was given drinking something and going back to sleep PERIOD

Moral of the story if ever sick abroad take a taxi to the hospital PERIOD



We hope you feel better soon PERIOD

Thank you for your continued writing about your experiences  abroad PERIOD  Its great that you share your experiences with people who may never get to see Spain or other foreign countries PERIOD  Hopefully it will make us realize that is much more to the world than our own country and people PERIOD

Its always good to be reminded to think globally PERIOD
