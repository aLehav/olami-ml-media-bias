Native American boarding schools were established during the late nineteenth century to educate and assimilate Native American children and help them join American society as an additional labor force PERIOD The purpose of the boarding schools was to destroy all that was Indian within the Indian child specified Trafzer To destroy their culture their music their language their eating habits their work habits and thats what the boarding schools were all about. trafzer utilizes the term cultural genocide originally coined by Raphael Lemkin in  as the main theme throughout his book PERIOD Lemkin said that genocide is more than just killing people PERIOD Its also making sure that they cant reproduce PERIOD It means that you can destroy their livelihood destroy their economies explained Trafzer PERIOD Another segment of the definition includes separating children from their parents and their people which is how he believes the boarding schools practiced cultural genocide PERIOD

The book is one of many awardwinning works Trafzer has authored including Earth Song Sky Spirit and Death Stalks the Yakama Epidemiological Transitions and Death on the Yakama Indian Reservation  PERIOD

Trafzer a descendant of Wyandot Indian and German parents was raised in Yuma Arizona near Fort Yuma Indian Reservation with the Quechan tribe PERIOD I was always interested in Native American history and when I went off to college at Northern Arizona University a lot of Indians were going to school there and some of my friends there were Navajo said Trafzer PERIOD His close proximity to the Navajo people and his work as an archivist led to his masters thesis and his Ph.D dissertation on Navajo history PERIOD

Before joining the UCR faculty in  Trafzer worked as a museum curator for the Arizona Historical Society starting in  where he found his love for oral history telling PERIOD He then taught American Indian History at Navajo Community College where he wrote Kit Carson Campaign The Last Great Navajo War about the Navajos account of the Trail of Tears and the Long Walk PERIOD

Trafzer went on to teach American Indian studies at Washington State University in the history department specializing in the Indian cultures of the western Canadian plateau between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast Ranges PERIOD He mentioned I knew very little about the people of the northwest especially the plateau PERIOD So I started a research project that I continue today and write on about the plateau Indians specifically the Palouse Indians. this work eventually lead to his next book Renegade Tribe The Palouse Indians and the Invasion of the Inland Pacific Northwest which won the  Washington Governors Writers Award for the best nonfiction in northwestern history PERIOD

After the death of his father he moved back to the Southwest to be closer to his mother in Yuma and became chair of American Indian Studies at San Diego State University in  PERIOD Trafzer then started the American Indian studies program in UCRs Ethnic Studies department after joining in  PERIOD He transferred to the history department in  because he says he wanted to work with graduate students which ethnic studies did not have at the time PERIOD

Trafzers next book will be on field nurses or public health nurses who worked among our local tribes all Southern California Indians during the period from . they were hired by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to visit all the reservations and meet with families to teach them health education and prevent diseases PERIOD

I love what I do PERIOD I love to teach and I love to research and write concluded Trafzer PERIOD His upcoming works include the aforementioned book about field nurses and a biography of Wyandot medicine woman Eleonore Sioui PERIOD
