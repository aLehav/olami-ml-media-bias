Breakfast options for oncampus students are limited on the weekend giving the perfect excuse to go to the International House Saturday morning for an allyoucaneat pancake breakfast PERIOD

Gamma Sigma Sigma National Service Sorority will host its second annual Pancakes for Parkinsons breakfast event to benefit the Michael J PERIOD Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research on Saturday from  a.m PERIOD until  p.m PERIOD

The event is open to UT students as well as the Knoxville community PERIOD

Pancakes for Parkinsons is a charity event hosted by Gamma Sigma Sigma and all proceeds are going directly to the Michael J PERIOD Fox Foundation Amanda McNeil junior in political science and member of Gamma Sigma Sigma as well as one of the events organizers said PERIOD

Pancakes for Parkinsons is an exciting event that allows people to give back to the community while enjoying a delicious breakfast of allyoucaneat pancakes Heather Thomasson sophomore in psychology and Gamma Sigma Sigma member said PERIOD

The Michael J PERIOD Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research was established by its namesake actor Michael J PERIOD Fox in May  with the goal of finding a cure for Parkinsons Disease PERIOD Fox was diagnosed with the degenerative neurological disease in  and went public with his diagnosis in  PERIOD To date the foundation has funded  million in research PERIOD

While Gamma Sigma Sigma hopes to double what last years event raised they also hope to educate others about Parkinsons Disease and what is being done to find both new treatment options and a cure PERIOD

The main goal is to get awareness out there about what Parkinsons is McNeil said PERIOD And if researchers have enough money to conduct their research we could quite possibly see a cure for Parkinsons Disease and other neurological disorders in our lifetime. in addition to eating as many pancakes as they can hold event patrons will be able to participate in raffles for a gift basket from the Mast General Store and gift cards from local restaurants PERIOD An informative slide show about Parkinsons disease will be played continuously as well PERIOD

There will be a raffle so people will have a chance to win a gift Thomasson said PERIOD There is also the opportunity for people to learn more about the disease and efforts to find a cure PERIOD I strongly encourage UT students faculty staff their friends family and neighbors to come out. gamma Sigma Sigma members also believe that by attending the event guests will have the benefit of knowing their money will help someone PERIOD

People should attend not just for Gamma Sigs outrageous cooking skills but they should because there is such a good satisfying feeling in participating in something bigger than yourself knowing that you helped fund research to find a cure for someones wife dad brother mom aunt husband or anyone who might have Parkinsons McNeil said PERIOD

A cure is on the horizon and we can help raise money by eating pancakes Thomasson said PERIOD

Tickets are  in advance and can be bought on the Pedestrian Mall Friday afternoon PERIOD Student tickets are  at the door with a valid UT ID and nonstudent tickets are . at the door PERIOD
