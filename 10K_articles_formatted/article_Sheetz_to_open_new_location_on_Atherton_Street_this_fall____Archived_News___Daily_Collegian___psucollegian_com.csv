State College residents will have another place to fill their tank or grab some grub when Sheetz opens a new location on South Atherton Street across from the Hills Plaza PERIOD

The project which was approved by the College Township Council last week will include a Sheetz convenience store with a gas station as well as a realignment of West Branch Road PERIOD

College Township council member Forrest Remick said groundwork on the project has already started and construction on the new building will start sometime around May PERIOD

The projected date of completion for the new Sheetz is sometime this November but Remick said that could change PERIOD

Remick said the new location would provide a muchneeded gas station to a location that currently lacks a place to fuel up PERIOD

Remick said the development area that will hold the new Sheetz will also include a bank and another building PERIOD Developers are also hoping to build a car wash and a restaurant in the area Remick said but no plans have been established PERIOD

Taylor Ritchie seniorrecreation park and tourism management said the new location will make it easier to get a coffee or some French fries from the convenience store chain PERIOD

Ritchie said he prefers Sheetz to the popular alternative of Wawa because he lives in western Pennsylvania near where Sheetz was first established PERIOD

Sheetz is better than Wawa hands down Ritchie said PERIOD Its a big thing up here being right in the center of the state. christa Rittenhouse sophomoreindustrial engineering also enjoys Sheetz but only when she is home PERIOD

Though the State College area has four Sheetz locations  five including the new one  there isnt a Sheetz on campus PERIOD

I always thought that it would be great if they had a Sheetz on campus Rittenhouse said PERIOD

While the Sheetz would offer new business to the area Remick said the council is concerned with what the store will look like PERIOD

Remick said he wants the store to look less gaudy than other Sheetz locations PERIOD

And while the council has yet to see the building plans for the new location Remick said he has been told it will feature a different design PERIOD

Along with building plans construction to the area will see a realignment of West Branch Road as the entrance to the road will be moved so it forms an intersection with the entrance to the Hills Plaza Remick said PERIOD

Representatives from Sheetz could not be reached for comment by press time Sunday PERIOD
