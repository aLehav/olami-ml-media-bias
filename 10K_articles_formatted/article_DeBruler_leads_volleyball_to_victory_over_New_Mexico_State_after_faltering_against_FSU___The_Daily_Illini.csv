DeBruler had six of her gamehigh  kills in the first set and Bartsch added four kills in the set PERIOD

In the second set the Illini had an early lead but couldnt hold on as senior Kylie McCulley paced Illinois with five kills PERIOD

We were really frustrated with Florida States style of play because it is a lot faster tempo than what we are used to McCulley said PERIOD

The Illini improved their play in the match against New Mexico State on Saturday afternoon PERIOD Illinois won in three sets    PERIOD

We really picked up the effort in the New Mexico match McCulley said PERIOD We had more of a team effort and picked up on our defense a lot. deBruler paced the team with  kills and  digs PERIOD Junior setter Hillary Haen notched  assists and  digs PERIOD

Illinois ended the weekend with an exhibition match against an Italian club team on Saturday night winning in three sets    PERIOD

Hambly said that the exhibition match was a chance for the Illini to show the kind of volleyball that they are capable of playing PERIOD

The exhibition match was a great learning experience we were able to pick up a faster style and our playing was free and loose McCulley said PERIOD

Next weekend the Illini return to Huff Hall for their first home match at the State Farm Illini Classic PERIOD

This weekend we learned that we need to find our leadership and more of an identity Hambly said PERIOD We are ready for Stuff Huff which I think is the greatest event in the country.",DeBruler leads volleyball to victory over New Mexico State after faltering against FSU - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
