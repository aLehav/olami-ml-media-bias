We didnt all have Mustang Time in high school but we all sat through something like it PERIOD

The name of the weekly organizational meeting time was dependant on your schools mascot and the administrations affinity for alliteration PERIOD Patriot Period Wildcat Warmup Marmoset Meeting etc PERIOD You know what Im talking about PERIOD

And hats off to the East High Marmosets  you guys have been through a lot I assume PERIOD

Silly names aside the content of these homeroomesque meetings was probably similar just simple high school logistics like how lighting firecrackers daily outside her room is not the best way to celebrate Mrs PERIOD Stallbreckers retirement PERIOD Ethnic slurs denoting European ethnic groups are still ethnic slurs PERIOD Just because your civics teacher has a welldocumented drinking problem you know the longhaired one with the lazy eye doesnt mean his students need to head their tests 

But what I remember most vividly were the learning strategies surveys PERIOD There were three potential classifications which I suppose were worth knowing because Teacher said so PERIOD The visual learner distinction meant that PowerPoints and graphic aides enabled students to absorb information PERIOD An auditory classification meant that you were wellsuited for lectures PERIOD Kinetic I think was reserved for Alex D PERIOD Linz in   the old  learning strategy PERIOD

Loath though I am to admit it there was and is a certain merit to being cognizant of the media through which we best absorb information PERIOD In particular I think the distinction between auditory and visual or their potential combination is one that nicely applies to peoples taste or distaste for literature PERIOD It stands to reason that a staunchly auditory learner might not feel at home when handed a novel the size of a cinder block or a collection of poetry that deals in experimental form structuring on the page and shies away from sound flourishes and rhyme schemes PERIOD

Now who am I to try and account for our societys apparently growing depreciation of literature but I assume there are multiple explanations for why half our nations youth say  and under post  under the Favorite Books heading of their Facebook profiles PERIOD

For someone who doesnt completely detest the written word but sometimes finds it flat and uninteresting I might prescribe a live reading  a congregation of people who gather at a specified location to witness a writer give voice to that which otherwise sits on the page PERIOD

And believe it or not Im not referring to some semifictional anomaly PERIOD The No Name Reading Series is a biweekly affair at which University of NebraskaLincoln graduate student writers share their work free of charge PERIOD The Clean Part Reading Series brings wellrespected contemporary poets to Lincoln two or three times a semester PERIOD And it cant hurt to stay up to date on the event calendars of Indigo Bridge A Novel Idea or our local Barnes  Nobles PERIOD In promotion of new work authors often travel around the country for readings and signings PERIOD

For detractors of reading aides or purists who demand that people enjoy the written word because  when has  ever been an effective reasoning method of persuasion It didnt work for Juliets parents or the minister in  Why would it work now

Im simply saying that students and youth dont pop out of the womb less interested in literature than they were  years ago PERIOD Generating interest is contingent on good teachers  scholars who can make literature come alive for their students  instructors who can render texts relevant topical and dare I say it engaging PERIOD If value can be ascribed to literature then people will seek out ways to make it personally interesting PERIOD A reading might be one such method  an author rounding out their own work in a performance space with a voice a pace and an intimate knowledge second to none of the text in front them PERIOD
