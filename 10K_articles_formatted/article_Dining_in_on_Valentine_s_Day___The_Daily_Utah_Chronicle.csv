Salmon

 lb to  lb of salmon fillet

 Tbsp butter not margarine

 dash of olive oil

lemon juice to taste

salt to taste

Spade L Ranch Fish and Seafood Seasoning if you want it like my mom used to make and I promise you do

Skin the salmon and rub it with the seasoning of your choice PERIOD Heat a skillet over medium heat and add butter and olive oil to the skillet PERIOD After the butter has melted add the salmon to the skillet PERIOD Fry the salmon until the bottom  of the salmon looks cooked through then flip PERIOD My mother always breaks up the salmon into smaller pieces to ensure its cooked all the way through and that it gets properly seasoned but I must admit there is something visually appealing about an intact salmon fillet PERIOD Serve hot PERIOD

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries

 oz chocolate
 lb strawberries

Wash the strawberries and cut their stems off PERIOD Place wax paper or parchment on a flat surface PERIOD Cut the chocolate into small chunks and melt in a double boiler PERIOD If you do not have a double boiler place the chopped chocolate in a glass bowl and microwave for  seconds then stir vigorously PERIOD Repeat until all the chocolate is melted PERIOD Dip the strawberries in the chocolate and then place on the wax paper PERIOD Let the chocolate harden and then serve PERIOD

Drinks

White Wine
Tea I highly recommend Tea Grottos Citrus Mint Tea
Sparkling Cider

If you are looking for some mood music I recommend a Spotify playlist featuring mellow jazz and beautiful vocals that work wonders PERIOD
