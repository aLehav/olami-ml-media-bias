The Michigan wrestling team needed to flex its muscles this weekend PERIOD

Coming off an uninspiring performance against Ohio State last Sunday the Wolverines had the opportunity to go back over . in Big Ten duals against Wisconsin  overall  Big Ten and Indiana   PERIOD

No one showed greater toughness to get No PERIOD  Michigan   over the hump than fifthyear senior Max Huntley PERIOD He was one of seven Wolverines to earn victories in their matches against Wisconsin as the team went on to defeat the 17thranked Badgers  PERIOD

In addition to his win Friday Huntley earned a  victory in his match against Indiana PERIOD He watched his team rout the Hoosiers  on Sunday PERIOD

Huntley trailed  in his match against Wisconsins Timothy McCall a top10 wrestler in the 197pound weight class PERIOD But Huntley knew he had his opponent on the ropes after finishing the end of the second period with a twopoint takedown PERIOD He earned five more points in the third period on his way to a comefrombehind  win PERIOD

In the past Huntley has struggled taking on other highlytouted opponents PERIOD But since being named team captain Huntley has put rankings out of his mind PERIOD

I started saying I should be able to beat the guy in front of me  Huntley said PERIOD Thats a mental trap and a problem I had in the past PERIOD I stopped looking at that PERIOD Every match youve got to wrestle hard and with grit. sophomore heavyweight Adam Coon had a comeback of his own against Indiana PERIOD After suffering his first Big Ten defeat of the season to Wisconsins Connor Medbery Coon punished his Hoosier opposition pinning his fourth opponent of the past five matches PERIOD

I would have had a better shot at beating Medbery had I been more aggressive Coon said PERIOD I really should have been attacking more in that match and thats what I did today against Indiana. coons dominance heading into his match with Medbery may have given him confidence but the ease of his victories also made his strategy too conservative PERIOD Making an aggressive tactical adjustment helped Coon return to his winning ways Sunday PERIOD

One of the biggest surprises of the weekend was redshirt sophomore lightweight Conor Youtsey who earned two sixpoint victories PERIOD Youtsey wrestled the first match in both duals and his impressive performances helped carry the team PERIOD

Our team did a great job following me Youtsey said PERIOD The momentum set the pace PERIOD The team came behind me and wrestled just as tough PERIOD Its good for the guys to see us be on top early on. michigan came into the weekend knowing it had to show off its strength in the middle of the Big Ten dual grind PERIOD Nine of the Wolverines  wrestlers recorded wins over the weekend and six finished  PERIOD Michigan coach Joe McFarland credited this success to the aggressiveness his lightweight wrestlers like Youtsey showed PERIOD

Most importantly the Wolverines showed they can win close matches PERIOD Especially in the Wisconsin dual they were able to find an edge in matches that were decided by just a few points PERIOD

We had six or seven matches that were going to be tricky said Michigan assistant coach Sean Bormet PERIOD We had to keep wrestling where we wanted it and we did a good job of that PERIOD When we had to get really tough in tight matches where maybe we didnt wrestle quite as well but had to stay really tough and win by a point we did it. on both days Michigan needed to show it was strong enough to hang in the loaded Big Ten PERIOD The weekend proved the Wolverines have the guns to duel with the nations best PERIOD
