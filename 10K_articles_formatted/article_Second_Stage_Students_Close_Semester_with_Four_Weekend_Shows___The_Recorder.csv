The CCSU theatre departments Second Stage Productions opened their doors for plays produced and performed by students that were at moments dramatic and at others hilarious to create a fine equal balance between the two PERIOD

The first of the four plays to be performed was Compressed a play thats told through the words of a brother of an upandcoming rapper about his and his friends attempts to gain drugs money and women but fall short in the end after tragedy hits one of them PERIOD

The use of vulgarity was prominent within the play but was evened out by the comedic scenes between the characters making fun of each other PERIOD The standout comedic performance though was James FloresLombays portrayal of Donny one of the friends in the play who suffers from narcolepsy causing him to fall asleep at the worst moments PERIOD

Sergio St PERIOD Felixs performance of the overly confident rapper Wes was also wonderful and the role showed Felixs rapping chops with freestyle recordings which may have been written beforehand but perfectly spoken none the less of Wes and a rival rapper Tre PERIOD

The rendition of the short Julie Marie Myatt play Mr PERIOD and Mrs. showed the empty feelings behind people who marry for the wrong reasons PERIOD The acting of Zack Heidorn and Julia Idarola really fleshed out the heartless thoughts their characters had for one another and the fake attempts to put on a front for their friends and relatives PERIOD

The attimes complicated play Home Free by Lanford Wilson was given justice from the great job that was done by the plays director Gabbi Mendelsohn and stage manager Anna Legassie PERIOD The performances of Kyle Mencel as Lawrence and Amy Lavorgna as Joanna really brought to life their eccentric and frightened sibling characters who are stuck in a play world PERIOD

The turning of the set into a playroom that featured many props were put to full use by parts where Mencel would skate around the set on a scooter smashing into things and Mencel and Lavorgnas characters love for a toy Ferris wheel theyre working on PERIOD

Perhaps the play with the most expletives but most actionpacked and funny was the Quentin Tarantinoesque Murder for Hire and Other Similarly LightHearted Topics of Conversation PERIOD

The play featured a wide cast of cold heartless killers who see murdering people as all in a days work PERIOD The witty writing of Ben McLaughlin who also played the quiet hit man Parker King was highly effective and hysterical in making characters who find nothing wrong with what they do for a living PERIOD

Two of the performances that really shined through were that of Kate Bunce as the vengeful Delilah Jones and Fred Doms as the maniacal organ stealer Maxwell Dafoe PERIOD

The choreography of the fight scenes was also very well delivered with all of the characters making their punches and kicks seem as realistic as possible PERIOD

The performances of all four plays raised the bar high for future studentrun shows with all of the members of each cast giving all they had into the constructions and roles that were involved PERIOD
