8928,2023-02-02,"editors note This article was initially published in The Daily Gazette Swarthmores online daily newspaper founded in Fall  PERIOD As of Fall  the DG has merged with The Phoenix PERIOD See the about page to read more about the DG PERIOD

Looking back at my Why Swarthmore essay and seeing the nave idealism of my 17yearold self is nostalgic albeit a little cringeworthy PERIOD

Take this passage I want to be part of a community where everyone has a cause or an interest and is eager to learn about other peoples passions PERIOD While I know not everyone at Swarthmore is focused on changing the world I dont think there is a better college to find people with the skills and commitment to do so. a tiny bit cringeworthy yes but I dont think I was the only one to write something like this PERIOD And I actually still agree with the sentiment of my essay even if my views are now more nuanced PERIOD I think it is true that one of Swarthmores defining characteristics is its students commitment to improving the world PERIOD Students throw themselves into studying social problems in classes linger at Sharples to discuss a point of moral or political contention and devote their little free time to activist groups or other socially conscious extracurriculars PERIOD

Now entering my senior year the focus has shifted to starting our careers PERIOD Although our futures are now an annoyingly prevalent feature of conversation rarely do students evaluate job prospects in terms of how they can work towards an improved world PERIOD This social conscience that was central to our Swarthmore experiences seems lost PERIOD What happened



This article isnt going to argue what particular career one should choose but will argue that Swatties should greatly consider how their career choices will contribute to a better world.This argument is based on two core factors the state of the world and the potential influence ones career can have on it PERIOD

Some things are very very wrong with the world PERIOD Although I would pick the present if I had to choose any time in history to live I dont think anyones conception of a just world would look like this one PERIOD

In States of Denial Knowing About Atrocities and Suffering Stanley Cohen writes that denial may be neither a matter of telling the truth nor intentionally telling a lie PERIOD There seem to be states of mind or even whole cultures in which we know and dont know at the same time.There are injustices that we know about in our classes and in Facebook arguments but seem not to know in our job search PERIOD

Globally . million children under five die annually from vaccinepreventable diseases  million people are currently displaced by conflict and climate change threatens to transform the world as we know it PERIOD Just within the U.S. there are enormous racial disparities PERIOD One in five children live in households that are foodinsecure and a certain wildly unprepared white supremacist is coming perilously close to the presidency PERIOD Many Swatties have experienced significant injustices themselves PERIOD

The largest reason some people suffer more than others is the circumstances in which they happened to be born PERIOD And while people even in the most adverse circumstances do their best to get by and make things better and many do manage to live happy lives they have to overcome massive barriers created by a world stacked against them PERIOD Many people arent able to overcome these barriers and it means smart girls are married off at age  never get proper treatment for a disability or as adults suffer the daily indignity of having to ask their sons every time they need something read PERIOD We know all these things but as Cohen writes we often dont know them at the same time PERIOD

Our careers are the largest opportunity we have to lessen these injustices PERIOD For approximately  years we will spend at least  hours a week working PERIOD If we want to change the world thats a big chunk of time to give up PERIOD

Beyond the pure amount of time spent on ones career Swatties are uniquely prepared to use this time to create change PERIOD We have been fortunate enough to receive one of the worlds best educations PERIOD Id like to think this experience will make us good parents and good community members but above all it prepares us to be good at our jobs PERIOD If we position ourselves in jobs that allow us to impact the world for good these skills could improve peoples lives in ways that would not happen otherwise PERIOD

Calling on people to change the world can sound corny but how can anyone look at the state of the world and not want to change it There are nave selfindulgent and paternalistic ways to try to change the world but there are also ways to do it well PERIOD And it would take a romanticization of ordinary life or even a certain sense of nihilism to deny that a Swarthmore education makes one significantly more prepared to effectively improve the world PERIOD

I think everyone has times when they think about the worlds problems instead of pushing them out of their head PERIOD I tend to keep those moments to myself PERIOD Thats partially a product of my personality but its also because I know no one is going to be able to say anything to change the fact that the world is full of injustice PERIOD But thinking about immensely prepared creative and driven people spending the bulk of  years working to change things makes me feel a little more hopeful PERIOD



So back to the question I asked earlier what happened How did the passionate sociallyconscious Swatties I know come to decide on the biggest opportunity they will ever have to improve the world with little thought of the ethical implications How did people who wanted to fight climate change and integrate feminism with economics and use art to demonstrate injustice decide to be consultants bankers and programmers for corporations they dont believe in

For the record I picked easy targets in that all those professions are highly paid and few people are particularly passionate about them PERIOD However I think there is a much wider range of professions that Swatties gravitate to without thinking of the opportunity for social good that their career provides. as far as I can tell enjoyment is not the dominant factor in career choices PERIOD If it were I think wed see a lot more people trying to become soccer coaches and musicians PERIOD Actually I would guess many Swatties would find quite a bit more enjoyment and fulfillment in careers they chose based on their social consciences than the careers theyre choosing now PERIOD

I dont think money is the main factor either PERIOD Its a factor but I think it influences decisions between similar jobs more than it alters oneschoice of career paths PERIOD I believe the biggest factor is subtler and in some ways more dangerous PERIOD Rather than basing their decision on money most Swatties dont really make a decision at all PERIOD

In  Marina Keegan explored why a quarter of Yale graduates go into consulting in her article Even Artichokes Have Doubts. keegan wrote that some of us regardless of what we tell ourselves are doing this because were not sure what else to do and its easy to apply and it will pay us decently and it will make us feel like were still successful. similar to Keegan my sense is that Swatties tend to choose a path of little resistance PERIOD Many Swatties genuinely do want to do something to improve the world but they dont really know how PERIOD Where does one apply to improve the world Conventional careers have clearer career paths and Swatties are more likely to know people working in these fields PERIOD Career Services sends out far more emails about how to get into consulting than community organizing PERIOD

In their career search Swatties dont take a 180degree turn away from their social conscience PERIOD But at some point it starts to seem like everyone else is getting jobs or internships and their parents start to bug them PERIOD Theyre not really sure what they want to do with their life so they start to get a little less strict about the type of jobs theyre comfortable looking for PERIOD And their social conscience gradually slips out of the equation PERIOD Once they start down this path if they start to feel guilty they might halfheartedly think of a few ways it could contribute to society but no one pushes them on the issue PERIOD Instead everyone congratulates them for their job offer PERIOD

To be sure no ones career is defined by their first job and some people who overlook the social impact of their first job later pursue careers that are very socially beneficial PERIOD But just as many Swatties social conscience gradually slips out of the equation as they choose their first job whos to say it wont when they get offered a promotion



I dont know how the tradition of screening The Graduate started but I would guess the resonance of Bens uncertainty and anxiety for his future played a large role PERIOD Yet as real as those fears feel we will be fine PERIOD In the stress of the job search its easy to feel like one is an inch away from being broke or a failure PERIOD And securing a job whatever it is pushes away that feeling PERIOD But this is a terrible reason to decide against a socially beneficial career PERIOD

There are legitimate reasons for giving less weight to social good in a career choice PERIOD Swatties might have family they need to support serious mental health struggles or at least in the early stages of their career massive loans that mean making money has to come first PERIOD However the vast majority of Swatties do not face these constraints PERIOD

Most Swatties come from a position of unbelievable financial security PERIOD There isnt comprehensive data on the financial backgrounds of Swatties but you can draw a sketch from financial aid data PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD median household income is  PERIOD Just  of Swarthmore students come from beneath this threshold PERIOD Furthermore  of Swarthmore students receive financial aid  do not PERIOD Since students not on financial aid dont submit financial information there is no way to know exactly where they fall on the income distribution PERIOD

However I happen to be a useful data point PERIOD My family had a gross income of  last year placing us in the ninety-second percentile nationally PERIOD We dont have any unusual financial circumstances though by living in suburban midMichigan we may have slightly lower home equity than families of similar incomes in more expensive real estate markets PERIOD It should be clear that my family is extremely wealthy but about half of Swarthmore students receive no aid while I got  this year PERIOD All financial aid information available suggests my aid award is not a fluke PERIOD Although financial aid isnt based on income alone it is based on a rough measure of wealth PERIOD Based on my data point its fair to assume that about half of all Swatties come from at least the richest  of Americans PERIOD Given the amount of aid I receive it could very well be  PERIOD

Just as Swarthmore students tend to come from the richest segments of one of the richest countries on the planet theyre likely to end up there as well its worth mentioning that  per person per year or  for a household of four is the threshold for the global one percent in terms of income PERIOD The median midcareer pay for a Swarthmore alumnus is  PERIOD If this median alumnus forms a household with someone of an equal income their household income would place them in the ninety-sixth percentile of the national income distribution PERIOD

And its not like pursuing a socially beneficial career means living in destitution PERIOD For some careers like medicine theres almost no tradeoff between social good and earnings PERIOD While elementary school teachers dont have enormous financial security their average salary is  PERIOD If they marry someone with an identical income they would find themselves in the seventieth percentile of the income distribution PERIOD Highlevel staff in nonprofit organizations the type of positions Swatties will realistically end up in if they pursue that career path tend to make more PERIOD Remember how my family is in the ninety-second percentile of the income distribution My mom gives free legal counsel to lowincome elders while my dad is a sociology professor PERIOD

In nonmonetary criteria as well Swatties are extremely secure PERIOD A Swarthmore degree is a ticket into the American elite PERIOD Its easy to forget that only  of Americans between  and  have a bachelors degree PERIOD Were going to have a degree from one of the countrys top colleges PERIOD We are able to access careers shut to most people and whatever career we go into we are likely to rise to the top PERIOD

Choosing a career based on social good also doesnt destroy your chance of enjoying your job PERIOD Maybe you would decide against the exact job youd enjoy most but given the range of careers that contribute significantly to society theres no doubt you could find a job you enjoy going to each day PERIOD For some people it might just mean working as a public defender instead of working for a major law firm PERIOD

A Swarthmore degree is an extraordinary safety net PERIOD Barring exceptional circumstances Swatties will end up successful financially secure and able to find a job they enjoy PERIOD This isnt to say there wont be bumps in their socially beneficial career path PERIOD Especially early in their career they might live less comfortably than they are used to PERIOD When they tell people what they do for a living they might not receive the sort of respect they expect PERIOD There are also fewer jobs in socially beneficial sectors so its not inconceivable that they might have to move into their parents basement for a little as they keep applying for positions though given the financial circumstances of most Swatties its probably quite a nice basement PERIOD But if one takes a deep breath and a step back its not hard to see that these are ultimately minor reasons to pass up ones biggest opportunity to improve a world incredibly far from anyones conception of justice PERIOD



As I said Im not going to use this article to try to determine which careers qualify as socially beneficial and which dont PERIOD As one tries to identify a career path it is important to consider what one believes to drive change and this will be highly dependent on an individuals values and politics PERIOD While it is important to push oneself to analyze these questions in an effort to identify how to effectively change the world through ones career there is nothing wrong with people coming to different conclusions PERIOD

I also dont find it productive to seek out the single career that will be the most societally beneficial PERIOD Many different careers offer enormous opportunities to change the world for the better and people will do more good if they are in a job they are good at and passionate about PERIOD The point isnt just to complete a moral checklist by receiving a socially beneficial job but instead to use ones career to effectively create change PERIOD

Some people will settle on unconventional choices and if they seriously prioritized the social impact of potential career paths before deciding that is completely acceptable PERIOD Someone might come to the conclusion that helping people access hiking offers an exceptional opportunity to make a difference in peoples lives PERIOD On the other hand they might decide that the best way to improve finance is from the inside or that they just want to focus on money so that they can give to worthwhile causes totally legitimate but in  years they better still be remembering to give that money away PERIOD

Broadening the definition of jobs doing social good could lead one to the conclusion that since society relies on an enormous number of professions a decent individual will inevitably benefit society in their career and thus one doesnt really need to weigh it in their career choice PERIOD I reject this PERIOD I accept that society needs bankers corporate lawyers and consultants PERIOD But does it need  of Swarthmores graduating class going into financial services consulting and business

I dont think many Swatties would argue that it does PERIOD I also think proponents of this line of argument are far more likely to use it as a halfhearted justification after theyve chosen a career path than come to that decision from deliberate introspection about how to use their career for good PERIOD Above all its difficult to deny that some jobs do more good than others and by having exceptional people in those jobs the world will be better off for it PERIOD

As you make decisions about your career after Swarthmore I think its worth remembering that Im not asking you to be a saint PERIOD I am making the case that you should make your careers ability to improve the world a central factor in deciding your path forward PERIOD As you make this choice its important to take the time to genuinely remember the worlds problems PERIOD Climate change could cause suffering beyond anything we face today and the largest reason you go to Swarthmore while others have a fraction of your opportunities is the lottery of birth PERIOD Im sure there are far more injustices that strike you as unbearably unjust PERIOD Dont just push them out of your head PERIOD

I commend those that are willing to make enormous sacrifices to change the world and I would urge you to consider whether you should but I dont think theres a direct correlation between ones sacrifice and their contribution to improving the world PERIOD For the most part making social good a central factor in your career choice will mean having a drawnout job search instead of finishing in October or really liking your job instead of loving it or ending up in the eighty-sixth percentile of the U.S PERIOD income distribution instead of the ninety-sixth PERIOD Right now whether by intention or oversight many in a group made up of the worlds most financially secure most educated and most capable people are passing up their chance to improve the world for these marginal differences PERIOD

I didnt write this article out of disdain for Swatties far from it PERIOD The reason is much closer to profound admiration and respect PERIOD If Im confident in anyones ability to help fix a spectacularly unjust world its ours PERIOD But I wonder how many of us will let the chance slip away PERIOD

For some people working  earning a salary can have a bigger impact than working directly on causes for good just look at what our fellow Swattie does with his income from Google httpswww.jefftk.comdonations  PERIOD  of his familys annual earnings are donated 150k which probably have a more significant positive effect if used wisely than his time PERIOD

Was just about to post something like this PERIOD

The underlying assumption behind this article is that the only way to use your career for good is to directly create some social good e.g PERIOD teaching medicine nonprofit advocacy etc. check out the Effective Altruism movement around the world which challenges this very assumption PERIOD  A good introductory book to this is Doing Good Better by William MacAskill Philosophy Professor at Oxford PERIOD He cofounded  Hours a nonprofit that aims to find careers that can have high social impacts PERIOD

I used to spent my summers in high school teaching at an educational nonprofit PERIOD All the teachers wages and a good portion of the program costs are paid by a rich hedge fund manager that understands educational equality and wants to close the achievement gap PERIOD

Dont count out the hedge fund manager that donates millions for social good PERIOD While most hedge fund managers are probably not like that note that a highpaying elite career does not mean you cant invoke social good PERIOD In fact you can often have a larger effect if you have the right mentality PERIOD

Do you really think charities and NGOs are capable of bringing about truly significant development in the third world I dont mean to sound incredulous its an honest question PERIOD If youre interested in these matters I found this very wellresearched book
httpswww.amazon.comAmericanFoundationsInvestigativeMarkDowiedp0262541416
to be an interesting read though Im skeptical of many of its conclusions PERIOD

As to whether or not ones donations are more effective than ones time thats a highly subjective question dependent on many exigencies not the least of which is how one chooses to measure effectiveness PERIOD Sure donating a bunch of money to foundations that do good work might have a more immediate impact on peoples living situations but this is far from the only measure one should consider PERIOD In all I think the effective altruism argument is at best reductionist and at worst a tacit endorsement of massive accumulation of private wealth as long as its counterbalanced with the appropriate level and sort of discretionary spending PERIOD

The fact also remains that most people who make large amounts of money do not tend to donate large portions of it PERIOD Also worth considering is the fact that Kaufman the fellow whose website Miles posted and his partner seem to after having given over half their salaries away still emerge with close to three times the median national household income PERIOD One can only imagine how much the hedge fund managers youre referring to come home with even after their donations PERIOD Whether or not its ethically justified at all to privately hoard such massive sums of cash is up for debate to say the very least PERIOD

Your assumption seems to be that accruing huge amounts of wealth is justified if you have the right  mentality PERIOD But whos to say what the right mentality is Ultimately such decisions come down to the massively wealthy person in question PERIOD To actively pursue power through wealth rather than working towards the dream of a more egalitarian society is pretty morally dubious in my view PERIOD

To illustrate what I mean consider a recent example American farmers dumped  million gallons of milk down the drain this year due to a surplus PERIOD If starving masses all over the world had any say in the decisions of these farmers I suspect they wouldnt have allowed such a thing to occur PERIOD I understand that in the near future a scheme where the disenfranchised might have such a voice is unfeasible to understate things but I find the thought of a future where they might to be comforting and worth fighting for PERIOD More so than a future where their fates are left in the hands of altruistic software engineers and hedge fund managers with the right mentality PERIOD

It depends on what you think education is for PERIOD As a lowincome student whose family is at poverty line Im more concerned with getting a job soon one that pays decently and that feeds me and helps support my family back home PERIOD That is my priority PERIOD You can call that the path of least resistance but in the end of the day providing for myself and my family is of more immediate relevance than some vague greater good that I should be contributing to in order to be fulfilled PERIOD That isnt to say that I dont plan on following my dreams but dreams have to have some kind of practical foundation to get off of the ground first and that is what an easy postgrad job is PERIOD This is also written under the assumption that people sell their souls and compromise their values if they dont go into a job field immediately related to public service of some kind PERIOD Theres more to what you do than your job PERIOD

I have a non swattie friend who works for a large banking company in IT PERIOD He enjoys earning lots of money with the goal of donating most of it to charity he spends an insane amount of time researching charities and thus funding those who do good PERIOD Someones gotta fund ya my friend PERIOD The important thing is keeping the sense of responsibility and giving PERIOD

Doing good and changing the world requires money and power PERIOD If anything we need more Swatties going into business and finance seize power and deploy that social and environmental conscience they developed at Swat to make decisions and push agendas that are for the greater good PERIOD
For example I know a consultant who works with labor ministers in the Middle East and pushes female employment agendas and a banker who donates 1M a year to good causes PERIOD They will do more good than what the author seems to want to give credit for just because their professions are not ideologically pure PERIOD
The impact you have on the world is what decisions you make with the power and resources you have at your disposal not what the nature of your profession is PERIOD

Im not going to have time to respond to a ton of comments but since Im in a procrastinating mood I just wanted to respond quickly to some of the comments that have been typed out PERIOD First thank you for taking the time to read my article PERIOD As for the criticism that I ignore how making money to fund worthwhile causes is a positive use of ones career I agree with you PERIOD In fact I agree with you so much I put it in my article I wrote that people might want to use their careers for good and as a result of this decide that they just want to focus on money so that they can give to worthwhile causes totally legitimate but in  years they better still be remembering to give that money away. i didnt try to use this article to say which specific careers are good and which are bad but that people should really evaluate how they think their careers can contribute to improving society and people will come to different conclusions on this PERIOD To the extent that I did target highpaying careers it was because its a vast overstatement to say most people going into them are doing so because they think its a really effective way to do good PERIOD I think a lot of Swatties gravitate to them because they follow inertia and never really get around to thinking about how to pursue a socially beneficial career PERIOD Some definitely might have evaluated this and would still have decided to pursue profitable careers but I think quite a few people wouldnt and as it stands I think relatively few people in highly profitable careers are giving away large chunks of their earnings PERIOD As for effective altruism Ive actually really quite a bit on it PERIOD Id quibble with its focuses on quantitative measurability neglect for political and systemic change and failure to discuss the harm one might cause in certain careers but it definitely influenced this article PERIOD

As for lowincome students I did fear that some nuance might get lost in the article and Im sorry that it did PERIOD I included a sentence or two that tried to make clear that for Swatties with significant financial hardship and they definitely do exist it might make sense to give less weight to social good in their careers especially soon after college PERIOD Being able to do good without serious consequences is a privilege PERIOD It is one I and most Swatties have but some dont and they shouldnt be thought of any lesser because of it PERIOD
