Audience members laugh at Donald Trumps rebutal to a question reguarding his tax information during the Presidential Debate Monday in Lumpkin Auditorium PERIOD Addison Bounds grey Adidas shirt a senior marketing major said he thought this part of the debate was especially laughable because Trumps response was just very off topic. samuel Nusbaum Administration ReporterSeptember  



The first presidential debate was full of policy and personal attacks as well as plans for the future PERIOD

Students gathered Monday night in the Roberson Auditorium in Lumpkin Hall to watch the two presidential candidates discuss topics includingthe economy national security and race relations in the United States PERIOD

Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee talked about investing in the peoples future to create jobs PERIOD She said she wants to close corporate loopholes which will help get money into the economy and invest in renewable in order to make the United States the clean energy powerhouse PERIOD

Donald Trump the Republican nominee said jobs are fleeing the country and heading to countries such as Mexico China and countries in the Middle East PERIOD He aims to make sure America looks good enough that companies will not outsource their jobs to other countries because he sees other countries as using outsourced U.S PERIOD jobs as rebuilding China PERIOD

Trump also said he would renegotiate the U.S.s trade deals PERIOD

Clinton said her economic plan would create jobs while Trumps would cause the U.S PERIOD to lose jobs PERIOD

When discussing taxes Trump said he would get rid of taxes which hurt the wealthy stating those are the people who create the jobs which fuel the economy PERIOD

Clinton responded by saying Trump is advocating for trickledown economics similar to what President Ronald Reagan had advocated for during his presidency PERIOD

Debate moderator Lester Holt asked questions on the controversies surrounding each candidate including the refusal of Trump to release his tax returns and Clintons email scandal PERIOD

Trump said he is under an audit which he claims is a common occurrence for him and he cannot release his tax returns PERIOD

He said in a show of spectacle he would release his tax returns against his own lawyers advice if Clinton would release all of the emails she has kept hidden during the investigation against her personal email server PERIOD

Lester interjected saying it is possible for a person to release their tax returns while under an audit PERIOD

Clinton said Trump should release his tax returns because all other presidential nominees whether they have won or not have done so PERIOD She said because Trump has kept his to himself he must be hiding something PERIOD

When it came to race relations the two candidates did agree on one topic PERIOD

They both agreed the relationships between communities and the police departments of the country have deteriorated and part of fixing the problems of gangs and gun violence in the country is to heal those wounds PERIOD

Clinton said there must be better training for the police in scenarios where force will be necessary PERIOD

Trump said many people are living in horrible conditions and cited the number of deaths in Chicago since President Barack Obama has taken office as an example of people living in horrible conditions PERIOD He also said many of the gang members were in the country illegally PERIOD

A point Trump made stirred some controversy in the auditorium of Hofstra University where the debate was held PERIOD

He said the police practice of stop and frisk worked and should still be used PERIOD Stop and frisk was used by the New York Police department as a way to make sure a pedestrian was not armed while they were talking to an officer PERIOD

The practice was ruled unconstitutional and the practice was abandoned PERIOD

As far as the email scandal Clinton was part of she said she regrets setting the server up and she would not make the server again if she could go back in time PERIOD

Trump said setting up a private email server is not something that is done on accident and was upset how many of her people pleaded the fifth during the hearings PERIOD

Jay Abell a political science major said he wished Trump could be more descriptive on certain topics such as the economy PERIOD Abell said he would have wanted to hear how Trump would create jobs PERIOD

Abell thinks Trump won the debate by a slim margin though is not the biggest fan of him PERIOD

He was not my first choice during the primaries Abell said PERIOD

Abell said he liked Jeb Bush but is sticking with his party and voting Republican PERIOD

Abell said he agreed completely with Clinton in regards to her comments on race and the police PERIOD

Kelli Halfman a graduate student and communication studies major said she thinks the debate as a whole was interesting and that Clinton won the debate PERIOD

She said the constant personal attacks were interesting and comical PERIOD

While she thinks Clinton told the audience what they wanted to hear she had a different view of Trump PERIOD

I feel like he deflected a lot Halfman said PERIOD

She also said Trump was rude and interrupted a lot PERIOD

After the debate had ended a vote was held as to who had won the debate with Clinton winning soundly among those present PERIOD
