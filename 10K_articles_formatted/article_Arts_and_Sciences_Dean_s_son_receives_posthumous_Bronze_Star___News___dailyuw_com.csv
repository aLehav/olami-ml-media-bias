They were fixing bayonets because thats all they had if the Taliban came up the hill said his father Robert Stacey dean of the College of Arts and Sciences PERIOD

Stacey said his sons final deployment brought him back to the province in Afghanistan known as Now Zad PERIOD By then Sgt PERIOD Stacey was a section leader for a weapons company PERIOD

After four years Now Zad transformed from a freefire zone to a peaceful town full of civilians PERIOD However there were still some members of the Taliban left in the outskirts of the town PERIOD

Robert Stacey said his son went ahead of his section to survey an area for improvised explosive devices IEDs when he set off a device and was killed instantly PERIOD

Sgt PERIOD Stacey was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star for multiple acts of bravery between September  and his final deployment in January  PERIOD Stacey and his wife Robin a history professor at the UW traveled to Camp Pendleton in February to receive the award PERIOD

Sgt PERIOD Staceys original orders would have kept him back at base camp but he chose to go to the front line to eliminate the remaining Taliban PERIOD

He insisted on being on the front lines to lead the guys that he had trained Robert Stacey said PERIOD Thats just how Marines are. his award citation describes an incident in December  when  to  enemy fighters were firing at his troops for hours PERIOD

Realizing his ammunition was running low he skillfully directed that his remaining rounds be used for obscuration as he maneuvered his squad out of the kill zone and back to the patrol base unquestionably saving the lives of his Marines the citation reads PERIOD

Sgt PERIOD Stacey was the only fatal casualty in his section PERIOD

His goal was to bring every one of the guys that he led home again Robert Stacey said PERIOD And he did. cole Zuckerman former president of the Husky United Military Veterans HUMV organization at the UW went to Roosevelt High School with Sgt PERIOD Stacey and got to know him better while they were both in the Marines PERIOD

Zuckerman organized an effort to place a plaque at the Duchess Tavern a popular UDistrict Pub which has a wall dedicated to Roosevelt alumni PERIOD

As you exit the service you are given a plaque to signify all that you accomplished and the gratitude that people who served with you shared for you Zuckerman said PERIOD Being that Will never made it out I wanted to make sure that he got a plaque made as a memorial to him. he said Sgt PERIOD Stacey was a hero of the Roosevelt community PERIOD

Before Sgt PERIOD Stacey was deployed he wrote a letter to his parents in case he was killed PERIOD His story received national attention when the letter was published PERIOD

Perhaps I did not change the world Sgt PERIOD Stacey wrote PERIOD Perhaps there is still injustice in the world PERIOD But there will be a child who will live because men left the security they enjoyed in their home country to come to his. robert Stacey said he contributes to the veteran community in any way that he can because his son would want other service members and veterans to be recognized for their service PERIOD

Its easy for us to feel like this war is not only happening somewhere else but it is affecting  people we dont know he said PERIOD It does affect people we know. robert Stacey spoke at the Memorial Day celebration on campus this January and will speak at a Student Veteran Panel in April PERIOD

Susan Terry director of the Career Center at the UW is organizing the panel to help faculty and staff recognize Veterans and Service Members on campus PERIOD She remembers hearing the news that Staceys son had died and the effect it had on the University community PERIOD
