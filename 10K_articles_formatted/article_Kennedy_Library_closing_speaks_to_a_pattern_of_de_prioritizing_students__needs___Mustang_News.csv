Shelbi Sullawayis a mechanical engineering junior and Mustang News opinion columnist PERIOD The views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Mustang News PERIOD

Theres no place quite like the library when youre in college PERIOD The library is my home base when I dont have classes PERIOD The first three floors are a goto for studying or hanging out with friends and when I need complete silence the fourth and fifth floors are places I can completely zone in on what I need to do PERIOD

At a school with more than  students it can be hard to find your desired study spot even in a huge library PERIOD Other buildings with study spaces such as Baker can fill up quickly and are out of the way for many PERIOD There are several outdoor study spots but the wind and glare from the sun can make studying there impractical PERIOD The library seems to have it all  a relatively central location both quiet and loud zones computers a coffee shop and tech help PERIOD

Which is why it came as a surprise to me that the library is scheduled to close in  for renovations and it is set to take until Fall  PERIOD This multimillion dollar renovation was initially supposed to go into effect in  but it got pushed back PERIOD

University spokesperson Matt Lazier told Mustang News in September that construction on Kennedy Library was set to begin Summer  and wont be completed until late  PERIOD

During construction library services will be housed in the Crandall Gym building temporarily PERIOD

In its constant aim for gentrification and revamping of the old to appeal to prospective students and families Cal Poly fails to take into account the needs of current students PERIOD The decision to close down the library exemplifies how Cal Poly prioritizes its image over the experience of the students who go here PERIOD The library is not just a resource students use in college but a need PERIOD There are so many individuals who rely on that space the freshman who wants to stay up late studying but not keep their roommates up the person who simply cannot focus at home the group that needs a study room to work on a class project PERIOD

With the renovation happening so soon it begs the question of how necessary it is PERIOD It isnt uncommon to hear complaints from students about the current state of the library PERIOD Many people feel that it is overcrowded with not enough seating in preferred areas and it has an outdated unappealing look PERIOD The renovation aims to address these problems with plans to add  seats expand the 24hour study space to the whole first floor and modernize many features of the library including adding an adaptable glass roof PERIOD

While there is definitely much room for improvement of the current state of the library it seems rash to close the facility without backup study spaces for students PERIOD During talk of the library closing in  the plan outlined closing zones of the library while leaving space to still be used for studying PERIOD It was not clear how large or small these zones would be and it is also unclear if this still applies to the  plan PERIOD Also they proposed that the new building the Frost Center will open in the near future as a hub for study spots PERIOD However this building is primarily for classrooms so without dedicated study spaces it seems unlikely that there will be enough room to support all the students that are being redirected from the library PERIOD

It sounds cliche to complain about how tuition money is being used but it is hard not to complain when Cal Poly is funding  million toward a project which will leave current students with no study spaces for two years PERIOD Ultimately money only comes into play for students when it affects Cal Polys reputation PERIOD College life can already be stressful enough as it is but forcing students to search even harder to find study spaces can make them feel even more lost in their environment PERIOD Many colleges have more than one library but Cal Poly does not have that to fall back on PERIOD Not only is this project displacing students from a place to study but it is displacing staff who work in the Kennedy Library PERIOD

It seems that on campus as soon as one renovation ends another starts PERIOD But when is the school finally good enough I think it is time Cal Poly starts investing in the wellbeing of its own students rather than lofty projects PERIOD
