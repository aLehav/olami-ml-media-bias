7647,1970-01-01,"jackofalltrades master of none PERIOD Thats me PERIOD The journeywoman athlete whos played more sports than you can count on your fingers and toes combined but whose overall winloss column reads like Anna Kournikovas career record before she decided she sucked at tennis and would make more money and get more ass out of modeling PERIOD

Visions of failed tennis players aside I stepped into my room last night and tripped over the softball mitt that Id forgotten Id left by the door then cursed and halffell over the abandoned bike helmet that Id dumped on the floor when Id torn up my room earlier that day to find new grip tape for my tennis racket PERIOD

I have a myriad of sports equipment littered all over the place PERIOD And I have this compulsive obsession with sports stuff that compels me to feed the addiction by adding to the growing collection every time something strikes my fancy PERIOD

Theres another problem which is part of the reason why I can play many different sports but cant consider myself proficient at any one of them I have a short attention span and go through phases PERIOD

Oh sports PERIOD How do I love thee Let me count the ways PERIOD

I was obsessed with the Ninja Turtles and karate when I was about  years old PERIOD I took tae kwon do lessons until I hit green belt then decided that it was too static and boring PERIOD

I went through a Mighty Ducks hockey phase when I was a kid PERIOD The problem was that in Singapore ice rinks are few and far between so that idea didnt last long either PERIOD

I tried track in my prepuberty days when I was a rangy skinny kid with zero muscle mass and little to no endurance PERIOD Even at age  my typeA personality asserted itself and I decided that coming in last every time was bad for my ego PERIOD

My softball phase at age  was fueled by a desire to be Dottie Hinson from A League of Their Own. i had a mitt and a bat and my sisters cousins and I would play pickup games in my grandmas front yard PERIOD But again I was limited by geographical constraints Noone plays softball in Southeast Asia PERIOD

So instead I played netball a combination of ultimate frisbee and basketball The onestep rule from ultimate applies but its played on a court with two posts and nets you cant dribble the ball and its all about quick passing PERIOD

That I was actually good at PERIOD Netball consumed seven years of my life before I got here and realized that hey guess what no ones heard of it let alone played it PERIOD

No matter PERIOD I picked up lacrosse PERIOD Which I wanted to believe I was somewhat good at but have since realized otherwise PERIOD It was fun for a while but now my lacrosse sticks sit in a corner of my room gathering dust PERIOD

Now that Im earning a meager salary for my daily toils at the campus newspaper that money goes toward feeding my sports addiction with bigger better toys than ever before PERIOD

I read Robert Kursons Shadow Divers two summers ago and decided that I wanted to learn to scuba dive so that I could go explore wrecks PERIOD Hence I took scuba lessons bought my boots fins goggles and snorkel got my PADI certification then decided that having to rent oxygen tanks and a wetsuit and drive to find bodies of water was just too much of a hassle PERIOD

I found basketball fun last winter even though I huck it like a watermelon was fascinated by soccer this fall even though I have two left feet and have since decided that I want to start road biking PERIOD A bike I ordered off the Internet is en route from Florida to Eugene as we speak PERIOD

My room is a veritable museum of my numerous quickfix sports obsessions PERIOD The only constant thats stood the test of time is tennis PERIOD Ive played since I was  and Im still playing and learning  years later PERIOD Its frustrating sometimes like last night when I lost  to someone whom I knew for a fact had an inferior serve and an inexistent forehand PERIOD But thats the one sport I turn to in between phases when Im antsy raring to go and waiting for my next phase to creep up on me PERIOD

The bottom line Im a sports junkie throughandthrough PERIOD But Im the kind that likes to play sports PERIOD

After all I cant sit still long enough to watch them unfold on TV PERIOD
