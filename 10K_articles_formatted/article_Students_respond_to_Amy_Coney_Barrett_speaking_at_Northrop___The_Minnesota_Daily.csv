United States Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett will be featured at the University of Minnesota Law Schools annual Robert A PERIOD Stein Lecture the school announced Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Students for a Democratic Society SDS a studentled grassroots organization plans to host a protest against Barretts appearance PERIOD

The lecture is moderated by Robert A PERIOD Stein a former law school dean and executive director for the American Bar Association and has highlighted Supreme Court justices every year since its inception in  PERIOD

Barrett joined the majority in Dobbs v PERIOD Jackson in  a ruling that eliminated the constitutional protections for abortion that were established in the  Roe v PERIOD Wade decision.Barrett also voted to end affirmative action programs in June which meant universities could no longer use race as a factor in their admissions processes PERIOD

The decision to feature Barrett for the lecture on Oct. at Northrop Auditorium came with strong opinions from students and the community PERIOD

Gillian Rath a member of SDS said it is important for students to be able to express their opinions PERIOD

As soon as the lecture information became public we had several student groups and community organizations in Minneapolis reach out to us Rath said PERIOD We have to use our voice and do what we do best to make sure that not only the University but Barrett knows that that kind of forces are not welcome here. rath added the protest is designed for students to express their opinions and to gain the attention of University officials PERIOD

People feel so strongly about this issue and it makes me think that the University does not listen to us Rath said PERIOD They dont care about our thoughts and feelings and they really dont care about our rights. interim Dean of the Law School William McGeveran heard student concerns through a meeting held on Sept PERIOD  with the Law Council the law schools student government PERIOD He said some students were excited about the opportunity to hear a different political perspective while others were unhappy with the decision PERIOD

My role and the law schools role is to support our faculty and students when they want to exercise speech rights McGeveran said PERIOD Whether thats bringing speakers responding to speakers or engaging in nondisruptive protests we want to see lots of different perspectives. one student who hopes the SDS protest does not interfere with Barretts appearance is Olivia Oldenburg a thirdyear aerospace engineering student PERIOD She said she is a fan of Barrett and plans to attend the lecture wanting to enjoy the event without any interruptions PERIOD

You cant agree with everybody and if youre going to have a political discussion with somebody youre going to have to respect their views and theyre going to have to respect mine Oldenburg said PERIOD

Oldenburg acknowledges the emotional toll some of Barretts decisions have had on people PERIOD She said she heard about the upcoming protest and was afraid it would affect her safety at the event PERIOD

I feel like coming up and screaming at Barrett is not going to help Oldenburg said PERIOD The decisions have already been made and theres no way she can overturn them. mcGeveran said he spoke with the University of Minnesota Police Department and Northrop Auditorium security to ensure that attendees are safe inside and outside the building PERIOD

They are going to have plans in place for any potential disruptions and particularly any disruptions that would cause physical harm to anybody McGeveran said PERIOD

Young Democratic Socialists of America at the University of Minnesota YDSA a student group on campus created a petition to educate students about Barretts stances on previous court cases such as Roe v PERIOD Wade PERIOD

Sahra Jilaow communications director for YDSA said the decision to bring Barrett to campus goes against the Universitys commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion PERIOD

Barrett has harmed every single marginalized community in some way with her policies and her continuing that rhetoric on campus creates more of a divide Jilaow said PERIOD

Jilaow added she wants to educate students about political issues as students may not be informed about the significance of Supreme Court cases such as Roe v PERIOD Wade which was a case Jilaow said she has heard lots of students have questions about PERIOD

I think it is important for people to have an understanding of what she has done and what she continues to do in the Supreme Court PERIOD I know a lot of people on campus would be against her beliefs Jilaow said PERIOD Its important for college students to realize who is coming onto their campus and what they have been representing. paul Batastini DellOvo a fourthyear sociology student who hopes to go to law school plans to attend the SDS protest in hopes of being heard by University officials PERIOD
