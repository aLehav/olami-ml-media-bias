Carter Young ended his match in a manner different than any in his infant college career PERIOD

On his belly PERIOD His opponent on top PERIOD

And for the first time since November the referee didnt raise Youngs hand PERIOD

No PERIOD  Oklahoma State dismantled Columbia  Sunday afternoon at GallagherIba Arena in Stillwater PERIOD

But for at least one bout the Lions   EIWA dominated OSU   Big  PERIOD

No PERIOD  Young entered his 141pound bout seeking his first ranked win of the season PERIOD But No PERIOD  Matt Kazimir a bearded senior with NCAA tournament experience ensured Young would have to wait PERIOD

Kazimir pressured Young with an early takedown in a first period that was wrestled mostly in the neutral position PERIOD

Then things changed PERIOD

Kazimir deferred to top position for the second period and began to wear Young down with a punishing style of offense that will run rampant in March PERIOD Kazimir continued to shove Youngs head to his mat and bullied the freshman PERIOD

Kazimir ended the bout with a  win and  of riding time PERIOD A warning of the work Young has yet to accomplish PERIOD

He needs to get a little closer vision closer to my vision of where he needs to go Cowboy coach John Smith said PERIOD Listen hes gotta be tough PERIOD He didnt respond much PERIOD He ended the match on his belly and to me that doesnt look good PERIOD You need two takedowns in the third to win this match PERIOD There was no thought process there of getting one. youngs potential is clear to Cowboy fans PERIOD Its evident to his teammates and Cowboy coach John Smith PERIOD

Carter is really really good man Kaden Gfeller OSUs  pounder said PERIOD He can win it all PERIOD Forsure AllAmerican PERIOD He is that good man PERIOD Ive wrestled Nick Lee PERIOD Ive wrestled Jaydin Eierman PERIOD He is just as good as those guys. but a loss Sunday afternoon served as a reminder PERIOD A reminder that Youngs development in a weight class that has been viewed as a weakness is vital in a search for a thirty-fifth national title PERIOD

A freshman with national title aspirations must exhibit signs of physical and mental dominance PERIOD

And Gfeller can contribute with that PERIOD Gfeller has experienced the same thing throughout his career PERIOD

And it starts in practice PERIOD

You just cant go in there acting like were friends Gfeller said PERIOD When its time to scrap we gotta scrap PERIOD Pushing each other into the wall PERIOD Sometimes those guys coming right out of high school this is a different level of intensity PERIOD Whenever you come in there intensity needs to be sky high PERIOD Well get that with Carter PERIOD I have no doubt. at  No PERIOD  Trevor Mastrogiovanni dominated No PERIOD  Joe Manchio of Columbia PERIOD  leaving no doubt about his ranking PERIOD He controlled Manchio and finished with nearly three minutes of riding time PERIOD

I thought Mastro did a nice job of separating the score Smith said PERIOD Kind of sending the message out there that if youre ranked No PERIOD  in the country youre not wrestling with me PERIOD

A bout later No PERIOD  Daton Fix handled Columbias Angelo Rini  with more than four minutes of riding time PERIOD It was one of six Cowboy bonus point victories in the dual PERIOD

Gfellers first bout in over a month ended early PERIOD He accumulated  near fall points including a nearside cradle attempt in the second period PERIOD He finished Dan Fongaro of Columbia with a  technical fall just over  seconds into the third period PERIOD Gfeller was sidelined last week due to the flu and still exhibited a hoarse throat in the press conference PERIOD

Going that long without making weight is never something you wanna do he said PERIOD So its good to make weight and wrestle good because were about to start hitting some guys that I need to beat PERIOD That I know I can beat. at  Wyatt Sheets continued his sevenmatch win streak at  PERIOD He scored a pair of takedowns to beat Andrew Garr  PERIOD

For the second week in a row Jalin Harper trotted out onto the mat PERIOD This time at a different weight PERIOD  PERIOD Travis Wittlake was introduced as OSUs 165pound starter prior to the dual but an unspecified minor injury kept him off PERIOD

Its nothing serious but you just didnt want to go backward Smith said PERIOD I didnt want to see him maybe get into a situation that may take him out for three days because its a new injury. harper remained on his feet for the majority of the bout something he didnt do a week ago PERIOD But that didnt matter PERIOD No PERIOD  Joshua Ogunsanya used two takedowns to beat Harper  PERIOD

Despite trailing  after the first period Dustin Plott defeated Nick Fine  at  pounds PERIOD But it was that thin margin that left Smith frustrated PERIOD

You watch Dustin Plott and what are we doing in the match Smith said PERIOD I mean we have to get a takedown late in the third period and a rideout to win. at  Dakota Geer continued his recent by crushing Brian Bonino  PERIOD It was Geers sixth bonus point win of the season PERIOD

AJ Ferrari also earned his sixth bonus point win with a third period pin over Sam Wustefeld PERIOD

At heavyweight Luke Surber collected his second pin of the season PERIOD But this one didnt last a minute PERIOD Surber turned Columbias Jalen Stephens who weighed in at  pounds and pinned Stephens in  seconds PERIOD

Im getting better each match Surber said PERIOD I never wrestled above  until this year PERIOD Everything is just a learning experience right now for Big 12s and nationals PERIOD Im just getting ready for that. but even with the win Smith and his Cowboys expect more PERIOD

I just need to really focus on making sure we continue to separate scores and maybe get back to what I thought where we were in late December he said PERIOD
