If youve heard the saying Dont eat it if you cant pronounce the ingredients then you may be surprised that allnatural bananas contain 3methylbutyl 1ethanoate which sound like chemicals from Breaking Bad PERIOD

Processed foods are typically seen as a nono for healthy diets but this view is terribly nearsighted PERIOD

Truthfully processed foods include wholewheat bread frozen fruit and nuts PERIOD These are foods that most people would consider healthy but theyre also processed PERIOD You see the problem here already  making food choices based on its processed status can be misleading PERIOD

Judging foods on a health continuum is an important step to eating better PERIOD For example thinking processed foods are always unhealthy is an example of binary thinking PERIOD Its easy to fall into this trap of black and white terms PERIOD Critical thinking is required to differentiate between a minimally processed food and a heavily processed option with added ingredients but in doing so youre setting up for better dietary decisions PERIOD

Minimally processed foods include bagged spinach canned tuna and frozen vegetables PERIOD Processing in this sense is more a matter of convenience PERIOD You want to actively add these into your diet PERIOD

Cereal milk and yogurt  like they serve in the Hornets Nest  are good examples of moderately processed foods PERIOD Once again these shouldnt be avoided or thought of as bad even though they do contain added ingredients PERIOD Dairy products are fortified with vitamin D mainly because of the synergistic role of vitamin D and calcium to promote good bone health PERIOD Cold cereal products are often fortified with several vitamins and minerals as its often the goto breakfast for children PERIOD Moderately processed foods dont need to be sought out but assuming a healthy diet theres nothing wrong with eating them on a daily basis PERIOD

Finally there are heavily processed foods like salad dressing cookies and frozen pizzas PERIOD They typically contain added sodium sugar and fat to enhance the taste and increase the shelflife PERIOD Such foods should not be made a habitual part of your diet PERIOD

As you can see processed foods include more than just Cheetos and basing your food choices on avoiding them will surely have you running in circles PERIOD Some processed foods you should eat every day while others should be consumed rarely PERIOD

Instead of going mad avoiding processed foods choose foods based on calories macronutrients fat carbs and protein vitaminsminerals and most importantly your personal preference PERIOD
