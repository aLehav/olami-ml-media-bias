2633,2023-11-04,"in case you missed the banners that are up all around campus UC Irvine is celebrating its fortieth birthday this year PERIOD Having some free time this summer I browsed through some of the old rustic New University archives in the office to see what UCI was like  years ago PERIOD The headline of the first New U PERIOD article immediately jumped out of the page PERIOD
Students are niggers PERIOD When you get that straight our schools begin to make sense. in its early years the New U PERIOD primarily published critical activist editorials that were typical of student papers at the time across the nation The first story by the way talked about how students were getting screwed over by the public education system. by the 1980s the New U PERIOD had turned itself into what you might consider a more typical newspaper with a traditional journalistic format PERIOD
The New U PERIOD has changed a lot in the  years since our first issue was published on Oct PERIOD   with that headline printed on the front page PERIOD And yet the New U PERIOD has remained unchanged PERIOD
In fact some of the stories published back then are eerily similar to some that we publish today albeit in a different context PERIOD Students in  like students today reported on the shortage of oncampus housing the difficulty of finding parking spaces and in particular complained about the UC Regents decision to increase tuition
