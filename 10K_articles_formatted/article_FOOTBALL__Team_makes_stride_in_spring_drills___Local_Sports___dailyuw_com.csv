E.J PERIOD Savannah LB  Savannah took the starting WIL position away from fellow junior Chris Stevens and continues to be one of the biggest hitters and playmakers on the defense PERIOD

J.R PERIOD Hasty RB  It isnt so much that Hasty has played terrible as much as it is that Louis Rankin has increased his lead as No. pERIOD The coaches meanwhile are waiting for the player who broke almost every state rushing record to show up PERIOD

Anthony Russo WR  Russo has been dealing with nagging injuries all spring and may have been passed by the impressive Marcel Reece as well as Corey Williams who came out of nowhere this spring and worked himself back into the rotation PERIOD

Robert Lewis TE  Lewis had trouble separating himself from his competitors and as a senior may be forced to watch Johnie Kirton and Michael Gottlieb play ahead of him PERIOD

While the Huskies saw vast improvement from the  and  seasons in  and  coach Tyrone Willingham was emphatic during the spring season saying that the time to become a bowl team is now PERIOD

When asked what the players got most out of the spring practices Willingham said 

Much of the burden in becoming a winning program falls on the quarterback and Jake Locker the heralded recruit from Ferndale Wash. has assumed the role of No PERIOD  quarterback PERIOD

The youngster has shown immeasurable promise but also the inconsistency of inexperience PERIOD

 Locker said PERIOD 

While many on the team are excited with the talent and leadership the firstyear quarterback brings quarterback Carl Bonnells play has spoken for itself PERIOD

 offensive coordinator Tim Lappano said PERIOD

Another standout offensive is junior transfer student Marcel Reece PERIOD The 6foot3inch 240pound man had three touchdown receptions in the spring game and at times he looked unstoppable PERIOD Other offensive players that made names for themselves are guards Casey Bulyca and Morgan Rosborough and wide receiver Corey Williams PERIOD

On defense the strength appears to be at the linebacker positions PERIOD Senior Dan Howell leads the group but Donald Butler and E.J PERIOD Savannah have more than held their own in the spring season PERIOD

 Savannah said PERIOD 

With only eight defensive backs on the roster right now Baer admitted that the Huskies will need help from some of the incoming freshmen PERIOD Other defenders that stood out this spring are defensive end Caesar Rayford and safety Jason Wells PERIOD
