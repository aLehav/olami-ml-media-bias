Calling the trends a modern demographic revolution Becker stressed the possible economic ramifications of the observed decline in fertility rates across all global regions PERIOD  Among other things payasyougo social programs such as social security and Medicare and research and development efforts stand to suffer Becker said

Many countries may even see their population sizes fall PERIOD  Without influxes of immigration the low fertility rates seen in the majority of European countries as well as China and Japan among other countries will cause decreases in their populations

Becker pointed to an unprecedented expansion in benefits to higher education as playing a crucial role in the decrease in average family size claiming that higher education and fertility are inversely related PERIOD  The rise in womens educational attainment in particular has upped the value of a womens time outside of the household thereby decreasing fertility rates PERIOD

Becker also drew on his own groundbreaking quantityquality theory of children to argue that parents are increasingly opting to improve their childrens quality by assisting them in their pursuit of higherlevel degrees as a result parents can afford to have fewer children and the quantity of children per household has dropped PERIOD  These educational trends are not unique to the U.S. and in fact Becker stressed that the U.S PERIOD is no longer a worldwide leader in higher education PERIOD

Instead of attempting to provide an exhaustive discussion of current population research and politics Becker stated I hope that this will stimulate some research on the topic. he also left open to debate the question of whether economic forces can prove successful in returning fertility rates to their former higher levels PERIOD
