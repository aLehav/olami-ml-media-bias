2654,2023-11-04,"well its done PERIOD
This morning I went down to the print shop and faxed in my absentee ballot PERIOD Surrounded by high school students printing their final projects I filled in some blanks on a paper pressed a button and sent off one of the most important decisions in my life PERIOD
The results of this election are crucial PERIOD I know that we are told this every four years PERIOD It is a clich of civic life in America PERIOD However this time I believe that it is actually true PERIOD
America is at a turning point PERIOD  In the last eight years the wars the economy and the lack of leadership have taken a toll not just on America but also on the world PERIOD
The world cares about this election PERIOD It cares about American politics PERIOD I have spent many an afternoon here in South Africa answering peoples questions about both over a cup of coffee PERIOD The interest in the current campaign is overwhelming PERIOD Details significant and trivial are reported and consumed PERIOD
Every American election is news abroad PERIOD As the worlds only remaining superpower the president that the American people choose affects the lives of people who have never and may never set foot within our countrys borders PERIOD Small details that most of us dont know about impact their quality of life in profound ways PERIOD This means that sometimes as the only American in the room people will hold you responsible for something you had never even heard of PERIOD Once during a seminar at the school of Public Health at the University of Cape Town the professor lectured me about the harm that the Global Gag Rule has caused to South Africas fight against HIV and AIDS PERIOD Apparently the rule which cuts funding to any organization that provides refers or advises abortions had closed down a clinic that she was involved with PERIOD While this was frustrating for me I could understand why South Africans take such an avid interest in American politics PERIOD For them the results have personal consequences PERIOD
This year though mostly due to the candidacy of Senator Barack Obama the interest is even more intense than usual PERIOD It would be a huge understatement to say that he is popular here PERIOD His image is ubiquitous PERIOD I saw my first Obama image painted onto the side of a telephone pole the day after I arrived in Cape Town PERIOD
Since then he has popped up on trashcans walls and random nooks and crannies PERIOD I have seen his portrait both sprayed as graffiti in an alley and rendered in oil paint on the walls of a gallery PERIOD His books are bestsellers PERIOD Internet popups ask Obamas IQ is fill in a high number what is yours The University of Cape Towns speech and debate team recruits aspiring Obamas. i even saw Obama tshirts for sale in a onestreet town in Zambia during spring break PERIOD
This son of a Kenyan captures the imagination of a country sadly lacking in political heroes PERIOD While Nelson Mandela is greatly beloved and respected his successors are not PERIOD Mbeki the denier of HIVAIDS and his replacement Zuma best known for his rape trial have taught South Africans to be cynical about politics and made them particularly susceptible to Obamas appeal PERIOD
Yet the response Obama provokes is not uncomplicated PERIOD On one hand the idea that an African is on the verge of becoming the commanderinchief of the United States is a source of great pride PERIOD Many hope that an Obama presidency will benefit Africa PERIOD At the same time especially towards the beginning of my stay many South Africans expressed skepticism that Obama could win PERIOD As one guy put it Ill believe it when I see it. others asked why it has taken so long PERIOD And still others were openly skeptical about how much of a difference an Obama presidency would mean to them PERIOD After all he has so many other issues and areas that would demand his attention PERIOD
Following the election and voting from abroad has been an interesting experience PERIOD There have been moments when I have felt frustrated by the way everyone seems to feel obligated to offer his or her opinion PERIOD There have been times when I resented being held accountable for the actions of people I did not vote for PERIOD But then I am reminded that there are others who are affected by the way we vote PERIOD Whether we like it or not as Americans we have the privilege and the responsibility to vote carefully and with consideration PERIOD
