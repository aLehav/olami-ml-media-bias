So far this season the Massachusetts womens crosscountry team has faced a plethora of challenging teams week after week PERIOD Tomorrows meet at the Albany Invitational in Albany New York will add to that pattern PERIOD Teams like New Hampshire Binghamton Connecticut and Syracuse are all schools that gave the University of Massachusetts trouble in the past and will be tough to beat this time around PERIOD 
When we ran against Syracuse in September we had them beaten coach Julie LaFreniere said PERIOD We had some key changes and lost to them by a few points but it proves that we are close to Syracuse and have the ability to beat them. the Albany Invitational is a fairly large meet consisting of  teams and  women runners PERIOD Like the New England Championships last Friday the Albany Invitational is made up of teams from all divisions including division III Middlebury College which is a threat even at its low division level PERIOD 
Against these strong opponents LaFreneire and the team will depend on their usual top runners to perform as they have all season PERIOD Freshman Christina Derosa who received Atlantic10 Rookie of the Week honors last week will be the number one runner once again for UMass PERIOD Derosa finished twenty-fifth out of  runners last week and has finished first among UMass runners in all of the meets this year PERIOD Seniors Alexis Anzelone and Amanda Dahlberg have been the leaders this season as well as consistent runners for UMass PERIOD Along with Derosa the other freshman standout is Cuisle Kierans who has been a reliable second and third runner for the team PERIOD Kara Gillette Tricia Silva and Ashely Davidson will all be factors in helping UMass against the topranked teams tomorrow PERIOD
During the previous week the team continued with its fastpaced rigorous practices to prepare for these opposing schools PERIOD Along with the usual  a.m PERIOD practices twice a week LaFreniere has been stressing the importance of running fast in practice to train for the meets PERIOD She feels the team has done a good job adapting to the fast practices but understands that there is always room for improvement PERIOD 
They have all been working hard during this weeks practices and were trying to practice straight through this upcoming meet LaFreniere said PERIOD I have a sense that theyre a little flat from New Englands and didnt fully recover from that meet PERIOD I am pleased but just looking for a little more. thus far UMass has finished seventh first second and eleventh place in their first four meets respectively PERIOD Facing topranked teams UMass will have to carry out a toplevel performance PERIOD LaFreniere will look to guide her team to another successful meet tomorrow at  p.m PERIOD in Albany PERIOD
The Massachusetts mens crosscountry team will travel to New York to compete in the thirty-eighth Annual Albany Invitational tomorrow too PERIOD 
 This meet is not as big or competitive as our last meet coach Ken OBrien said PERIOD The fivemile race will consist of  teams from New England and New York PERIOD
The Albany men will attempt to win the race for the second straight year PERIOD Last year the Minutemen finished sixth finishing behind Albany New Hampshire Marist NYU and Syracuse PERIOD 
The Minutemen will try to get their season back on track on Saturday after their poor showing at New Englands PERIOD 
There are a lot of things to put together OBrien said PERIOD We come one step at a time PERIOD There is a lot of stopping and starting. but OBrien said this was to be expected with a younger inexperienced team PERIOD
We underperformed last week and Im glad that we dont have a week to sit around OBrien said PERIOD  Its good that we have a meet so we can regain the forward motion we had prior to last meet. captain Matt Clark was in agreement PERIOD 
Hopefully last week will wake us up so we will perform well on Saturday Clark said PERIOD
