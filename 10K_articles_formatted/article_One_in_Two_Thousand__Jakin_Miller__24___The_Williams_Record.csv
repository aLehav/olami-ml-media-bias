9570,2023-10-30,"each week we randomly select a unix from a list of all current students at the College for our One in Two Thousand feature PERIOD As long as the owner of a selected unix is willing to be interviewed and is not a member of the Record board that person becomes the subject of our interview PERIOD This week we decided to draw a name from a list of firstyear students and the computer using a script in R chose Jakin Miller  who discussed seeing a cow on Rte PERIOD  speaking English with Aristotle and speaking Norwegian with Norwegians PERIOD This interview has been edited for length and clarity PERIOD

I looked you up on WSO Williams Students Online and I saw youre from Williamstown PERIOD

I am PERIOD

Tell me about how you ended up at Williams PERIOD

I am on the Nordic ski team and the ski team is awesome here and that was a big part PERIOD And its a good school obviously PERIOD And Ive never really felt the need to escape Williamstown PERIOD Like many people dont want to go to school in their hometown PERIOD But I figured because I had a tip for skiing that would help me get in and I figured its a great school  I might as well PERIOD

Is Nordic skiing doing anything as a team this fall given that sports arent officially happening

Yeah we cant officially train PERIOD A couple of us have just been running together informally PERIOD We currently dont have a training plan or anything PERIOD

And I suppose no snow PERIOD

Right PERIOD We can rollerski but yeah PERIOD

Has your perspective on the College or the town changed since youve been a student

Yeah its kind of interesting to see it from the other side because  one example is Williamstowners always grumble about Williams students just stepping out into the road without looking PERIOD And I complained and now I do it all the time just because its what you do when youre a Williams student PERIOD So its fun to see both sides of it PERIOD

Interesting PERIOD So Im from New York City so I cant drive PERIOD I cant believe Im putting that on the record PERIOD But I assume you drive in Williamstown PERIOD

Yes PERIOD

So was that something that you had to deal with students running past your car

Yeah PERIOD

On a completely different note do you think aliens exist

No PERIOD

Why not

Well I think that life probably exists on the planets but I dont think intelligent life PERIOD

OK PERIOD Why

I think we would have seen evidence of them PERIOD

Do you have an idea of what you want to major in

Not really PERIOD Maybe physics but not really sure PERIOD

Do you think about physics while youre doing Nordic skiing

No PERIOD

Other than Nordic skiing are there any socially distanced extracurriculars that youre thinking of getting involved in

I signed up for rugby so Im excited for that PERIOD I signed up for a lot of things because the Purple Key Fair is easy  you just sign up for a lot of things PERIOD But rugby is kind of the main thing PERIOD And rockclimbing too PERIOD

Do you have any experience with rockclimbing

Some PERIOD

What does that mean

I have climbed on maybe a dozen occasions inside PERIOD

If you could get Snar  well wait PERIOD Do you know what Snar is

No PERIOD

Snar is the Williams abbreviation for Snack Bar the late night food PERIOD If you could get Snar with any person living or dead who would it be

Thats a hard one PERIOD Probably  Pauses. i dont even know where to start thinking about that one PERIOD Can we come back to that one

Yeah sure PERIOD I want to hear more about what its like to grow up in Williamstown PERIOD I know its a quiet place in many ways  perhaps in other ways not PERIOD But whats the weirdest thing youve seen here

There was a cow on Rte PERIOD  PERIOD

What Really In the middle of the road

In the middle of the road PERIOD I was biking and there was just a cow in the middle of the road PERIOD

What did you do

Well there were other people taking care of it so I just biked by PERIOD But yeah there was a cow in the middle of the road PERIOD Probably dont get that in New York City PERIOD

No not so much PERIOD What are you most excited about about being here as a student

Probably just access to everything the College has to offer because Ive always lived here but I havent been really able to be part of the Outing Club or  Ive been to soccer games but its different when youre a student  or be on the Williams team and study in the library and take classes and stuff PERIOD

You mentioned you were maybe interested in studying physics PERIOD What drew you to it

Ive always kind of been interested in machines and how things work  science math PERIOD

What are you least excited about with being a student with being a student in COVID times

Well before I came to Williams I could just go around Williamstown without a mask and there werent really many restrictions PERIOD And now I cant do that obviously and I cant go see my family like I would normally be able to PERIOD So not excited for kind of living only in the bubble PERIOD But there are good things about that too PERIOD

What was it like moving in from like 

Two miles away It was a little funny PERIOD It was like Yeah Im going to college. my parents were like Yeah well be back in ten minutes just drop you off. and one of the professors who was greeting everybody came in  he was my soccer coach for six years PERIOD Like Oh hi PERIOD Hi Coach. so Im sure it was a little different from most peoples experience PERIOD

To go back to my earlier question who are you getting Snar with

Who am I getting Snar with Ive been having to read a lot of Aristotle for my classics class and figure out what he was trying to mean PERIOD So Id probably get it with him and ask him PERIOD

Do you think he speaks English

Probably not but if Im getting it with him then well pretend he speaks English PERIOD

I assume this is your Record debut

Correct PERIOD

So is there anything that you want the Williams community to know about you that I havent asked you about

I speak Norwegian PERIOD

You speak Norwegian

I do I studied abroad in Norway last year PERIOD

Why How Was it a gap year

Gap year PERIOD

Cool PERIOD What were you doing there

I was at a oneyear school quoteunquote studying sports training PERIOD I had Norwegian class and then I trained the rest of the day PERIOD

Was the sports training stuff in Norwegian Do you now know how to say all the tendons in Norwegian

I think its even a lower level of study. i just trained PERIOD I didnt study training  I just trained PERIOD

Oh you did Nordic skiing training

Yeah PERIOD

Do you ever get Pete Buttigieg references

No PERIOD I dont know who that is PERIOD

He ran for president and famously spoke Norwegian and people thought he was really cool for that PERIOD Whats your favorite Norwegian word

This word hyggelige higliya but its spelled like higaliggy. i read it in a book and someone asked me the very same question and I said Higaliggy And they laughed at me because thats not how you say it PERIOD

What does it mean

Like pleasant PERIOD

What do you miss most about Norway

Probably my friends because I lived with them at a boarding school for a year and then Im not really going to get to see them again PERIOD

Did you get sent home

Yes PERIOD

Oh thats too bad PERIOD Well is there anything else I should know about you other than your secret ability with Norwegian

Not that I know off the top of my head PERIOD
