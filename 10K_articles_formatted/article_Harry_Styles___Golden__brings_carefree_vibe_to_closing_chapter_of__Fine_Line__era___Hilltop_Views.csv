Last week Harry Styles released the music video for his hit song Golden. golden features Styles signature pastel color scheme contrasted against the Amalfi Coast where the video is shot with a fitting dash of bright yellow PERIOD As usual his style is impeccable the music video features a fair share of buttonups and tweed with a particularly striking blue blazer PERIOD The video exemplifies the carefree androgynous outlook that Styles has displayed throughout Fine Line. throughout the video Styles embraces a childlike energy which even if you arent a fan of his music is pretty endearing PERIOD As he runs through town he salutes passersby breaks into dance on a bridge and mimes the notes being played on his fingers PERIOD The whole video feels like youre watching a child frolic on vacation and you cant help but smile as you watch PERIOD

The video is simpler in nature than that of Watermelon Sugar or Adore You. the only character who appears is Styles the entire focus is on him PERIOD

By creating such a simple music video Styles opened its interpretation up to his fans PERIOD This allows anyone to connect with it PERIOD

No matter how you interpret Golden there is no doubt that the carefree joy it exhibits is the perfect antidote to any bad day PERIOD
