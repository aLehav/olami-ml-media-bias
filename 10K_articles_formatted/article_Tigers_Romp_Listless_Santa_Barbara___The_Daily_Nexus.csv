4111,2004-01-30,"away from the comfort of Rob Gym for the first time this season the UCSB mens volleyball team fell to University of the Pacific  in Stockton last night PERIOD

We didnt play a very good match Head Coach Kenny Preston said PERIOD They outplayed us. at the net UCSB  overall  in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation showed its blocking strength with  total team blocks whereas the Tigers had only six PERIOD Junior middle blocker Michael Kennedy and sophomore opposite Evan Patak led the Gauchos in blocks with six and seven respectively but that was not enough to stop Pacific junior opposite Brian Zodrow who finished the night with a matchhigh  kills PERIOD

We couldnt stop him Preston said PERIOD We werent in a very good spot on him blocking. pacific dominated on offense and in the back row hitting . on the night and recording  team digs PERIOD Junior libero Mike Gawlik had  digs for the Tigers PERIOD

They dug way more balls than we did Preston said PERIOD Their libero was very good. although the Gauchos have been serving consistent matches in recent weeks  errors were made at the service line against the Tigers PERIOD While UCSB had four service aces they gave up twice as many to Pacific PERIOD

We didnt serve an exceptionally good match Preston said PERIOD

Offensively freshman outside hitter Jake Wiens led Santa Barbara with  kills hitting . on the night PERIOD Kennedy hit . pERIOD However all other regular attackers hit below . in Stockton PERIOD

We werent in very good rhythm offensively Preston said PERIOD Our outside hitters werent very good and were not going to win a whole lot of games with one middle and one outside. with a host of topten teams in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation the Gauchos will have to improve their game to hang with the top PERIOD

I dont think we can find the major answer right away PERIOD Were still a very young squad Preston said PERIOD I think we can try to get a little steadier offensively PERIOD We can start by keeping the ball in play a little more. santa Barbara will travel to the Stanford Maples Pavilion to take on the Cardinals at  p.m PERIOD tomorrow night PERIOD

Stanford is a good team Preston said PERIOD Its going to be hard to bounce back but if we can come out with a split it will have been a good road trip. print
