One of the most interesting ways to better understand a person is by hearing their answer to this question Who was your favorite character in The Lion King Clearly how they respond will provide splendiferous insight into who they are as a human being why they do what they do and other necessary philosophical queries that if we simply took the time to ask and subsequently listen would greatly enhance the connections we have with one another thusly augmenting the holistic quality of our society with ferocious fervor PERIOD

Whether they say Simba Nala Mufasa Timon Pumbaa Scar Zazu or one of the hyenas youll be able to extract several key points of reference you can utilize in an empathetic manner when it comes time to ask more serious questions that you may disagree on such as what was your reasoning for voting for Donald Trump what do you make of his bizarre relationship with Vladimir Putin or what does the fox say

This may seem like a comparatively basic question PERIOD There are plenty of other questions that are simple yet elegant mundane yet insightful etc PERIOD Maybe rather than have them choose from a limited spectrum of fictional characters you want to discover what animal said person believes is the best manifestation of their personality PERIOD Note If we were you this comparison should be restricted to personality PERIOD Although it may seem impossible we have decided scientifically that you are able to totally remove considerations of aesthetics in deciding what animal best serves as a manifestation of your personality. additional Note Do not confuse this thoughtful query with its more banal cousin If you could be one animal what would you be We must do better. two questions may prove to be insufficient PERIOD If we are to see the world from our political enemies point of view or the point of view of a small child raised in a fundamentally different society in a region ravaged by war we need to be able to ask contemplative personal questions PERIOD

For example you can ask him or her How would you describe the color blue Admittedly this is a tricky one PERIOD Such a query dives into the somewhat suffocating limitations of language and how your dialogue partner handles it may offer you unforeseen knowledge as to their motivations and what they ultimately hold dear PERIOD Guard yourself  they may try to avoid the question altogether by answering an imagined question that you didnt ask PERIOD It is quite possible that by the time theyve finished providing you with this answer to the imagined question you may be too tired to tell them that they didnt answer your question  or maybe youll have forgotten the details of your original question PERIOD No matter PERIOD You see some of the world needs to be asked questions by others of the world PERIOD It is the most important PERIOD
