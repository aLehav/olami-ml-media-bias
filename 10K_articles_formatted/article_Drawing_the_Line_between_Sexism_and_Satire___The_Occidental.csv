There has been a significant amount of controversy surrounding the Xxxtra Credit short film on CatAList PERIOD It is problematic that such a liberal enlightened campus can watch one comedic short film that features an Asian woman and interpret the film as representing all Asian women or women in general PERIOD Some students are offended by this short some thought it was funny others were neither offended nor entertained PERIOD In light of the controversy people should remember that every piece of media depicting a minority or a woman is not a reflection of a racist or sexist climate and entertainment should be taken for just that  entertainment PERIOD

The students offended by this short film have expressed the opinion that it was both racist and sexist PERIOD It is said that the video portrays Asian women as hypersexual and depicts women as using sex to succeed in the professional world PERIOD The video however simply showed a female teacher who was trying to have sex with a student during an exam PERIOD The male student had no idea that she was trying to have sex with him and only wanted to finish his exam PERIOD In addition to claims of sexism it does not make any sense that a female professor needs to use sex to succeed in the professional world PERIOD The only way this claim could possibly make sense is if a female student were trying to have sex with a male professor PERIOD

The larger issue is the argument that the short portrays Asian women as hypersexual thus reinforcing a stereotype PERIOD Many are sick of seeing this age old depiction of Asian women PERIOD It is important to be aware of such feelings and recognize the stereotype as annoying and perhaps even harmful to the Asian female community PERIOD

However the role does not require that the professor be Asian and according to Matthew Salus junior a producer of Chili Flakes the actress was simply the best actress that auditioned for the role. as for the accent The actress was from China thats how she talks PERIOD The script was not written for any particular race. people do not see white male actors as portraying all white males so the idea that an Asian actress portrays all Asian women seems a bit racist PERIOD This line of reasoning implies that all Asian women act the same way PERIOD Regardless of whether a person is white black Asian or a purplepeople eater the person that actually believes stereotypes represent an entire class of people or that a comedic short film represents an entire class of people is the real racist in this story PERIOD

In the world beyond the Occidental bubble the media makes jokes about race religion political affiliation gender hair color and anything else that distinguishes one human from another PERIOD Saturday Night Live made ruthless jokes about the blind governor of New York David Patterson PERIOD Naturally the blind community was offended while others thought the skit was funny PERIOD I am blonde and there are stereotypes that blondes are stupid PERIOD I am a woman and there are stereotypes that we want to get married and have babies and if we dont we are cold bitches or feminazis. but in the real world people make jokes out of stereotypes PERIOD In the real world people dont change their last names to initials because their name is offensive PERIOD Many students at Occidental have made a habit of turning every piece of print film clothing etc PERIOD into a largescale racist or sexist issue when that was never the intention PERIOD If comedy is going to exist then people have to be prepared to be objects of humor PERIOD
