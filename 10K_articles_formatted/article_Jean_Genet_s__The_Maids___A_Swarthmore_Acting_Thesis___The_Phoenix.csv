8926,2013-03-07,"this past weekends performances of The Maids served as reminders that Honors Theater theses are one of the bestkept secrets within Swarthmores arts scene PERIOD These projects in acting and directing present an opportunity for Swatties to put on challenging and often deeply intellectual works as a culmination of their four years of work in theater study and often amount to great performances of plays outside traditional university theater repertoire PERIOD

The Maids which ran in LPACs Freer Ensemble Theater for four performances this past Friday Saturday and Sunday was not perfect but was one of the more interesting artistic performances oncampus this past year PERIOD It featured performances that were at once bombastic and nuanced and its  minutes remained tense in spite of its limited action PERIOD

The play a work of French existentialism by Jean Genet that premiered in  is based on the infamous Papin sisters two maids who killed their employers wife and his daughter in  PERIOD Much like the way the Dreyfus affair heavily influenced Proust this murder entered the French zeitgeist before Genet channeled it and its themes into his work PERIOD

The plays simple plot finds two eponymous characters Solange Sophia Naylor  and Claire Jeannette Leopold  plotting to kill their employer Meryl Sands  PERIOD Yet this simple plot only serves as the structure on which Genet hangs the plays major concerns class otherness and filth PERIOD

When looking at plays we decided this was the perfect thing for a thesis Naylor said PERIOD It has a lot of layers is very intelligent and offers three challenging roles. naylor Leopold and Sands initially had difficulty choosing a play for their thesis project restricted by the dearth of plays with written for three actresses PERIOD

There arent many plays like that Naylor said PERIOD We could have done Three Tall Women but then they did that for a thesis just a few years ago. i think there are about six plays written for three women and we read them all said Leopold PERIOD Though she acknowledged that last years allfemale production of American Buffalo was incredible she says that she Naylor and Sands didnt want to do a drag production of a play for three men PERIOD

For me Ive played a man in about half the productions Ive done at Swat she said PERIOD Which is silly PERIOD I dont look like a man. at the advice of their director Emmanuelle Delpech the three theater majors chose The Maids for its complex roles and themes PERIOD

And the three actresses made wonderful work of their complex characters actualizing Genets multifaceted women PERIOD During her limited time on stage Sands played a wonderfully twisted woman of the house conjuring an odd mix of privileged naivety and callous imperiousness PERIOD Her character the plays sole embodiment of the entitled upperclass is one the audience is designed to loathe and such isnt an easy task PERIOD Sands allows for her lines to beg for just enough sympathy from viewers that she doesnt come across as a facile caricature but a character too PERIOD One that if only for a few moments throughout seems to deserve as much empathy as the maids themselves PERIOD

Though the maids even as the plays protagonists arent straightforwardly empathetic characters either PERIOD Before they switched roles Delpech had originally cast Naylor as Claire and Leopold as Solange but the switch was a wise decision PERIOD

Though Leopold said that shed never been able to play a character so vulnerable before she really excels at it PERIOD Though like all else in the show this vulnerability is complicated by several other layers and emotional obfuscations it shines through during the entire play and becomes one of the most compelling parts of the performance PERIOD

Genet  a criminal and homosexual who felt othered by society  intended for the play to be a mediation on otherness PERIOD Though the oddity of these characters is easy to achieve its their vulnerability that makes them interesting and sympathetic characters PERIOD Thus its the vulnerability that Leopold is able to present through her character that makes her character work and makes the audience stay with her throughout the show PERIOD

Naylor however doesnt bring the same sympathy to her character and doesnt need to PERIOD Her acting plays with the same dichotomy of helplessness and disturbing malice that Leopold presents but leans much more toward the former PERIOD

She closes the play with an eeire monologue of significant length that ends the oftdisturbing play on an appropriately dour note PERIOD Naylor admits that she was initially intimidated by the lengthy and emotionally complex monologue but its delivery belied none of this PERIOD Delivered with the balance of menace and nave sincerity that makes that menace all the more menacing the monologue is the crux of the play and though it  like bits of the play throughout  do get a bit muddled  its performance is in control of multiple layers at once achieving a level of nuance well representative of four years of theater study PERIOD



RETRACTION The print version of this articleerroneouslylists Alexandra HuberWeiss as playing the part of Madame PERIOD While HuberWeiss was responsible for the productions costumes the maids employer was played by Meryl Sands  PERIOD
