9608,2020-12-12,"the audience rose for a standing ovation with nearly five minutes of applause PERIOD Hushed words of praise from audience members could be heard as they exited California Lutheran Universitys Samuelson Chapel PERIOD

The faculty recital on Friday Nov PERIOD  featured Yoshika Masuda assistant professor of music and director of string studies at Cal Lutheran PERIOD Masuda is the conductor of the string orchestra he teaches private cello lessons and music courses and is an awardwinning cellist PERIOD

Masuda closed his eyes periodically while playing practically hugging his cello with his head down and his ear close to the instrument like he was lost in the sound PERIOD His breathing could be heard over the instruments PERIOD

He just kind of captures the room PERIOD Its just really powerful to see someone play with that much emotion and its really inspiring too sophomore Rachel Counihan said PERIOD His cello becomes like an extension of his body. counihan has played viola in the string orchestra for two years PERIOD She is also in Masudas Music and Culture class and Chamber Music class PERIOD

For the recital Masuda performed two compositions Frdric Chopins Sonata in G Minor Op PERIOD  and Sergei Rachmaninoffs Sonata in G Minor Op PERIOD . he was accompanied by pianist Wojciech Kocyan PERIOD

Masuda said that he enjoys performing but his true passion is for teaching PERIOD

Its just a satisfying thing really when you sort of pass on what you learned to the next generation Masuda said PERIOD

Masuda said that he hated the hierarchy between teachers and students and the condescension he received from a lot of teachers PERIOD

He genuinely cares about each and every single one of his students PERIOD Theres a mutual respect and appreciation between the ensemble and him Counihan said PERIOD

Mark Spraggins a professor and chair of the music department said that Masuda has a lot of experience performing but not as much teaching so thats something he is developing right now. i think that because he performs music at a high level as a conductor hes very sensitive to some of the more subtle musical aspects Spraggins said PERIOD

Spraggins said that Masudas positive demeanor and patience are important qualities in a director because music is difficult and it takes time. he just has a really good understanding of our group and of our abilities and he knows how to get us to listen to each other which is so important in a small string group like us Counihan said PERIOD

Spraggins said that Masuda was Interim Orchestra Director and Professor of Cello last year until he was offered the fulltime job after a nationwide search last spring PERIOD

I think our committee our department felt very strongly that having the best performing musician would be the best for our department Spraggins said PERIOD

Counihan said the three other final candidates for the job besides Masuda test taught a class and conducted the orchestra PERIOD She said that they did not have Masudas conducting presence and confused the class on topics they had already learned PERIOD

I think of him as the epitome of when words fail music speaks because when hes trying to explain how he wants something phrased or how he wants us to play he will grab his cello and hell just play it Counihan said PERIOD

Masuda was born in Japan and has lived in Hong Kong Australia the UK and now lives in the U.S PERIOD

I was studying with Ralph Kirshbaum in Manchester and he basically got this endowed position at USC and asked if I wanted to follow him here Masuda said PERIOD

Masuda followed Kirshbaum to the University of Southern California USC for his doctorate because he said he still had more to learn from him PERIOD Masuda is also a founding member of SAKURA a unique and versatile cello quintet hailed as brilliant and superb by the Los Angeles Times according to the groups website PERIOD

We all studied with Ralph Kirshbaum at USC PERIOD Sakura in Japanese means cherry blossom and Kirshbaum in German is cherry tree. also if you look at a flower of a sakura it has five petals Masuda said PERIOD

Masuda said he feels that he is part of a cello family with his mentors and fellow students PERIOD

I feel like his love for classical music and for playing the cello hopefully is rubbing off on me because that is the level Id like to be at one day Counihan said PERIOD
