Remember Me



Stony Brook Baseballs freshman starting pitcher Brian Herrmann does not get nervous PERIOD He hardly ever puts himself in a difficult situation but when he is he refuses to let the heat of the moment derail his focus PERIOD

Herrmann tries to keep the good vibes going on the mound as he said after Sundays win against Hartford PERIOD

How good have Herrmanns vibes been The Northport New York native has a . earned run average the lowest among America East pitchers with a minimum of four starts this season PERIOD He had the pitching performance of the Seawolves season on Sunday shutting out the Hawks in seven innings while allowing three hits and striking out five batters PERIOD

The way he performed for us on Sunday is the way he has performed all season head coach Matt Senksaid PERIOD

He ranks second on the team in strikeouts and has the fewest walks among Stony Brooks starting pitchers PERIOD His seamless transition from playing high school baseball to Division I baseball comes at an opportunistic time PERIOD

Sophomore starting pitcher Bret Clarke has struggled in his first six starts of the season despite winning the America East Rookie of the Year award last season PERIOD He has a . eRA and has already allowed  earned runs after allowing just  in  innings in  PERIOD He began his freshman career in dominant fashion just as Herrmann is doing this season PERIOD

Fellow freshman starting pitcher Sam Turcotte has been rattled in recent starts despite showing glimpses of dominance PERIOD The 19yearold consistently hits  or  miles per hour on radar guns with his fastball PERIOD His high speed has helped him reach a teamleading  strikeouts PERIOD However he has also struggled with his command walking a teamleading  batters PERIOD

Herrmanns emergence as one of the best pitchers in the America East has helped distract from an otherwise disappointing start to the season for the teams starting pitching rotation PERIOD
