The prelude is a piece of music which has fascinated me for a long time Botes said in a press release PERIOD

Cello performance major Ryan Phipps said he really enjoys going to the lectures because he loves music history and the heart of his degree has an emphasis in music history PERIOD

All of our professors here have specialties in these different areas historically so its cool that we get to come see these things for free as students Phipps said PERIOD

The atmosphere at MUsic Mondays is very relaxed Phipps said and heenjoys having lectures outside of the classroom by history professors that he currently has or has previously had PERIOD

Its a step outside of what we learn in history academically and we get to take a closer look at certain subjects that we maybe touch on in the class but dont necessarily get to delve into Phipps said PERIOD

The MUsic Mondays series allows an opportunity for students faculty and community members to discuss and experience lectures on various music topics PERIOD
