4123,2010-02-23,"the UCSB mens tennis team dropped two matches in the San Diego rain this weekend losing  to the University of San Diego on Saturday and  to  San Diego State after a threehour rain delay on Sunday PERIOD

With an overall record of  the Gauchos finally play their first home games of the season against conference foes UC Davis on Feb PERIOD  and Pacific on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD The home environment will be good for the Gauchos according to Head Coach Marty Davis because they have been struggling with nerves since their close  loss at UC Irvine PERIOD

Its nice to be home Davis said PERIOD Its tough to win on the road PERIOD Weve learned some lessons and taken some lumps but provided we can stay positive about it we can be in great shape for the rest of the season. in college tennis the team that wins at least two of three doubles matches earns a doubles point that gets tallied in the total for the match PERIOD A win in each of the six singles matches counts as a full point for a players respective team PERIOD

Against SDSU the rain delay forced the Gauchos to play their singles matches first instead of doubles PERIOD Once again the team lost their three matches at the top of the order but took two out of three matches in the bottom half PERIOD Junior Philip Therp returned to the first singles slot for the first time in over a year after being sidelined with injuries PERIOD He lost both matches   but things are looking up for the Gauchos who now have only one starter on the bench in senior team captain Josh Finkelstein PERIOD

We need more production from the top half of our lineup Davis said PERIOD Philip is just now working his way back into it PERIOD We wouldnt expect him to play his best tennis out of the block but if he can improve again before this weekends matches then hes going to win. finkelstein is likely to sit out this coming weekend as well PERIOD

Josh is a strong leader PERIOD Hes a vocal leader Davis continued PERIOD He adds a lot of energy to the match environment for us PERIOD We miss that. on Saturday against the Toreros the Gauchos swept the doubles point and won the first singles set in the bottom four spots of the order but only freshman Benjamin Reckagnel managed a win PERIOD

It would be healthy for us to win a close match Davis said PERIOD We were a little bit nervous a little bit tight PERIOD We need to put those skeletons in the closet for this weekend. both matches begin at  p.m PERIOD at the Rec Center courts PERIOD
