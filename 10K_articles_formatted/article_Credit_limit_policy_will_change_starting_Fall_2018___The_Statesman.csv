Remember Me



Come the  school year students interested in taking more than  credits will no longer have to wait two weeks from the start of classes to enroll in all of their classes PERIOD

Right now when you register for classes the first two weeks after the enrollment term beginsthe credit limit is  USG Vice President of Academic Affairs Nicole Olakkengil said PERIOD The Friday before classes start the credit limit increases to  and then the week of classes on that Wednesday the credit limit increases to  if you have a GPA of . and above. next semester the limit will be increased the day before classes begin PERIOD Those with a GPA below . will be able to take up to  credits and those with a . and above will be able to take  PERIOD The one stipulation is that students with a . or above GPA must be in good academic standing i.e. they may not have a Q for academic dishonesty on their transcript or an I for incomplete from the prior term PERIOD

For students who balance multiple majors single majors with minors andor a hefty course load supplemented with work and familial obligations this credit change means having a set schedule earlier in the semester PERIOD It also means removing some of the stress that comes with enrollment each term and preventing students from missing as many days of classes as they may previously have had to PERIOD



Starting the Fall  semester you will be able to actually pick a course based on what you like instead of fighting for credits Olakkengil who has been lobbying for the policy change said PERIOD With the help of Richard J PERIOD Gatteau Ph.D. associate provost for academic success and faculty director for the Higher Education Administration Program Olakkengil managed to push the policy forward and get it approved by the Office of the Registrar PERIOD

When I was running for USG last spring my platform was to only have double majors be able to bypass the credit limit without any bureaucracy in filling out paperwork PERIOD After speaking with Dr PERIOD Gatteau I realized this was counterintuitive because it placed an unfair bias on double majors Olakkengil said PERIOD

Gatteau explained that in addition to wanting a level playing field a logistical concern warranted equal access to the new policy PERIOD

If this was an advantage given only to double majors you may have people declaring double majors just to get the credits for advanced registration where they dont intend to complete them Gatteau said PERIOD For me I thought from a fairness standpoint give the opportunity to everybody PERIOD You could have somebody in a major and two minors PERIOD There could be other reasons their work schedules and commuting where they need to be in certain times and classes. fatema Noor a junior biology and sociology double major at Stony Brook said she has faced difficulty fitting the required classes into her schedule before PERIOD Not only does she havetwo majors to worry about but likeall students she has to fulfill her Stony Brook Curriculum requirements PERIOD Starting out with a 17credit limit she said is fair but having to wait two weeks until the limit increases and in the meantime struggling to find a twocredit class or miss days is no easy feat PERIOD

In previous semesters I had to swap major classes that I knew would not fill upI had to let go of them to pick something else up Noor said PERIOD But it also kind of put stress on me what if I didnt get that seat

Olakkengil a junior biochemistry and sociology major has a similar story PERIOD

The problem is my two majors really have two different course requirements and you end up having to choose which course you take based on the credit limit like which one is more important she said PERIOD It sucks placing an importance on a course because that course may be valuable to you in another way but the problem is you have to put that importance on it if you want to graduation in time in four years PERIOD Increasing the credit limit actually helps with this. olakkengil credits Gatteau USG President Ayyan Zubair and her peers for helping move the project along PERIOD

Advanced registration will function as it currently does with seniors enrolling first followed by juniors sophomores and freshmen PERIOD New students will be kept at a 17credit limit throughout their first semester Gatteau said so as to curb the number of students enrolling in more classes than they can handle PERIOD

The average credit count for most of our students is about  credits Gatteau said but some students will take so many credits that theyll sacrifice their GPA PERIOD We dont want them to do that PERIOD The goal is to take the amount of credits that will maintain the GPA. he added that typically students enrolled in above  credits have a number of those credits dedicated to internships research andor independent study PERIOD

So few students ever take even beyond  or  credits but again the option is there if you can handle it PERIOD We dont say no to that. gatteau who helped institute the current policy at the university years ago said an important factor to keep into account is the registration of nearly  new students each year PERIOD We have to make sure everyone has a chance to register he said PERIOD

I am just always very focused on you know lets do what makes sense so that operationally students dont have to jump through an unnecessary hurdle to get to what they think is reasonable Gatteau said PERIOD

Specific enrollment dates for the Fall  will be published on the academic calendar in early March PERIOD
