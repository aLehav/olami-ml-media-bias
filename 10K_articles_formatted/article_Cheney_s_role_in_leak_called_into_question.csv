WASHINGTON AP  The White House yesterday sidestepped questions about whether Vice President Dick Cheney passed on to his top aide the identity of a CIA officer central to a federal grand jury probe PERIOD

Notes in the hands of a federal prosecutor suggest that Cheneys chief of staff I PERIOD Lewis Scooter Libby first heard of the CIA officer from Cheney himself The New York Times reported in yesterdays editions PERIOD

A federal prosecutor is investigating whether the officers identity was improperly disclosed PERIOD

The Times said notes of a previously undisclosed June   conversation between Libby and Cheney appear to differ from Libbys grand jury testimony that he first heard of Valerie Plame from journalists PERIOD

This is a question relating to an ongoing investigation and were not having any further comment on the investigation while its ongoing White House press secretary Scott McClellan said PERIOD

Pressed about Cheneys knowledge about the CIA officer McClellan said I think youre prejudging things and speculating and were not going to prejudge or speculate about things. mcClellan said Cheney is doing a great job as vice president PERIOD The spokesman also said Cheneys public comments have always been truthful PERIOD

The New York Times identified its sources in the story as lawyers involved in the case PERIOD

Libby has emerged at the center of Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgeralds criminal investigation in recent weeks because of the Cheney aides conversations about Plame with Times reporter Judith Miller PERIOD

Miller said Libby spoke to her about Plame and her husband Bush administration critic Joseph Wilson on three occasions PERIOD

Libbys notes show that Cheney knew Plame worked at the CIA more than a month before her identity was publicly exposed by columnist Robert Novak PERIOD

At the time of the CheneyLibby conversation Wilson had been referred to in The Times and on the morning of June   on the front page of The Washington Post PERIOD

The Times reported that Libbys notes indicate Cheney got his information about Wilson from thenCIA Director George Tenet but said there was no indication he knew her name PERIOD

The notes also contain no suggestion that Cheney or Libby knew at the time of their conversation of Plames undercover status or that her identity was classified the paper said PERIOD

Disclosing the identify of a covert CIA agent can be a crime but only if the person who discloses it knows the agent is classified as working undercover PERIOD The Times quoted lawyers involved in the case as saying they had no indication Fitzgerald was considering charging Cheney with a crime PERIOD

The paper said any efforts by Libby to steer investigators away from his conversation with Cheney might be viewed by a prosecutor as attempt to impede the inquiry which could be a crime PERIOD

According to a former intelligence official close to Tenet the former CIA chief has not been in touch with Fitzgeralds staff for more than  months and was not asked to testify before the grand jury even though he was interviewed by Fitzgerald and his staff PERIOD

The official told the Times that Tenet declined to comment on the investigation PERIOD

Libbys lawyer Joseph Tate did not return phone calls and email to his office PERIOD

Fitzgerald is expected to decide this week whether to seek criminal indictments in the case PERIOD Lawyers involved in the case have said Libby and Karl Rove President Bushs senior adviser both face the possibility of indictment PERIOD McClellan said both Rove and Libby were at work on yesterday PERIOD

Fitzgerald questioned Cheney under oath more than a year ago but it is not known what the vice president told the prosecutor PERIOD

Cheney has said little in public about what he knew PERIOD In September  he told NBC he did not know Wilson or who sent him on a trip to Niger in  to check into intelligence that Iraq may have been seeking to buy uranium there PERIOD

I dont know who sent Joe Wilson PERIOD He never submitted a report that I ever saw when he came back Cheney said at the time PERIOD   I dont know Mr PERIOD Wilson PERIOD I probably shouldnt judge him PERIOD I have no idea who hired him. asked yesterday whether Cheney always tells the truth to the public McClellan said Yes. frankly I think its a ridiculous question he said PERIOD The vice president like the president is a straightforward plainspoken person. the CheneyLibby conversation occurred the same day that The Washington Post published a frontpage story about the CIA sending a retired diplomat to Africa where he was unable to corroborate intelligence that Iraq was trying to acquire uranium yellowcake from Niger PERIOD The diplomat was Wilson PERIOD

A year after Wilsons trip President Bush cited British intelligence in his State of the Union address as suggesting that Iraq was pursuing uranium in Africa PERIOD
