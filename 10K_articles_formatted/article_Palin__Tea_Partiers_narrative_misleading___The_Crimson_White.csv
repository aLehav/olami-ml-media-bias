7958,2023-10-23,"at fist glance Tea Party participants seem like perfect vessels to the past PERIOD A sea of gray hair jean shorts long socks flannel and unironic trucker hats they march to the tune of Lee Greenwoods God Bless the U.S.A. a song so tired and undeniably campy that most Baptist churches are starting to retire it PERIOD They maintain a prurient bizarre obsession with the stock issues of the 80s and 90s like abortion and welfare mothers PERIOD If anyone can enlighten us about exactly how things used to be it should be them PERIOD

Last weekend Sarah Palin elucidated eloquently and neatly how Tea Partiers think things used to be and will soon be again PERIOD By that I mean she spoke in poetic abstractions and zingers for an hour sprinkling God freedom and tax cuts like so many commas PERIOD She created a onedimensional narrative primarily using it to caustically mock Obamas attempts to promote something beside a onedimensional narrative PERIOD American exceptionalism is the only protagonist plagued constantly by that big creepy bridgesustaining industrysubsidizing hospitalbuilding leviathan called government. palin has accused liberals of romanticizing an undeserving Obama and shes largely correct PERIOD Saturday she demonstrated the conservative version of this by calling for a return to the policies of neoconservatisms Hercules Ronald Reagan PERIOD This echoed Tea Partiers plea in October to develop a purity test whereby any Republican seeking Republican National Committee funding had to score  percent on a litmus test echoing Reagans philosophy of low taxes small bureaucracies and social conservatism PERIOD Democrats arent the only ones who can project onto a hero PERIOD

For starters Reagan did lower taxes in  PERIOD But he then raised taxes in    and  PERIOD This included raising payroll taxes and the capitalgains tax which Palin claims Reagan ended the recession in the early 1980s by lowering PERIOD

The deficit almost tripled during Reagans time in office PERIOD Yes it was mostly weapons spending and cutting taxes for the Gordon Gekkos of the country but note that the bureaucracy also expanded during Reagan PERIOD And I thought the whole idea behind the Tea Party Movement was that nothing was worth going into debt over  debt is debt PERIOD One way Reagan tried to compensate was attempting to cut Medicare the singlepayer program that so many protesters accuse Obama of wanting to eviscerate in the name of giving other people the benefits of socialism PERIOD

U.S PERIOD public debt as a percentage of GDP had actually been on a long aggregate fall since the 1950s PERIOD From  to  it shot up from  percent to  percent PERIOD It could be argued that Reagans raise on payroll tax which Alan Greenspan recommended was the most fiscally responsible move he made PERIOD Many claim that it saved the Social Security trust fund which to this day runs a hefty surplus contrary to the claims of budgetary alarmists PERIOD

First Tea Partiers like hardcore Obama apologists need to make a distinction between the idealism their god was elected on and the pragmatism that every public official must adopt when in office PERIOD

Second they need to pick up a history book PERIOD This country has been in various levels of debt since the Revolutionary War PERIOD The justification for government doing things not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution goes back at least as far as Alexander Hamilton during Washingtons first term and the legal justification goes back to  PERIOD

And while were on the subject the Founding Fathers were mostly Voltairereading deists who routinely championed religious tolerance PERIOD Jefferson once compared the Virgin Birth to the Greek myth of Minerva PERIOD Stop trying to brand these guys as fundamentalist Christians PERIOD

Hopefully one of two things will occur to Tea Partiers PERIOD The first is that their commitment to the past will go both ways and theyll say something like Man healthcare premiums are a good deal higher than they used to be PERIOD I wonder why. the second is that they consider that the splendid past they exalt may just be the medias afterthefact construction of the past and that politics is never the struggle between good and evil that the TV makes it out to be PERIOD
