524,2023-10-23,"mockingjay Part  the most recent Hunger Games film is a dark crowdpleaser that sets the stage for the fourth and final installment of the widely popular teen dystopian fiction series PERIOD More somber than its predecessors the movie is about protagonist Katniss Everdeens forays into political propaganda aimed at stirring up rebellion against the tyrannical Capital PERIOD The themes of media as a form of manipulation mass murder of innocents oppressive dictatorships and torture of political prisoners demonstrate director Francis Lawrences commitment to author Suzanne Collins grim subject matter PERIOD



Going into the movie I was worried that director Francis Lawrence would downplay some of the more macabre events in the books storyline PERIOD My worries were unfounded PERIOD From the makeshift hospital in District  to the ruins and human remains in District  the movie is full of harrowing visuals PERIOD These scenes depicting war atrocities even extend to an air raid on an underground bomb shelter and several scenes of revolts with immense casualties PERIOD

The acting in Mockingjay Part  is exceptional PERIOD Unlike her sedated performances in the previous films Jennifer Lawrences Katniss was much more emotionally evocative this time around PERIOD Phillip Seymour Hoffmans penultimate appearance on the big screen as Plutarch is remarkable but I was unsatisfied with the fact that many major characters from the other movies such as President Snow Donald Sutherland Effie Elizabeth Banks Haymitch Woody Harrelson and Finnick Sam Claflin play relatively minor roles in this film PERIOD This is due in large part to the constrictions imposed by the book but I cant help but think the film could have greatly benefitted by giving them more screen time PERIOD

The plot is slow but not boring PERIOD I suspect many fans will be disappointed that the movie doesnt have as much action as the first two installments but Francis Lawrence does a good job dressing up the minor scuffles that do happen PERIOD The films dialogue is uninspired but the books isnt any better PERIOD

The movies backdrop is superb easily on par with its impressive predecessors PERIOD The ruins were especially well done and make the movie look as if it was filmed in wartorn Gaza PERIOD The District  base also feels surprisingly realistic PERIOD Unfortunately one of my favorite parts of the past two films the flamboyant fashion of the Capital isnt as present PERIOD All of the imaginative outfits were relegated to Peeta Josh Hutcherson and Caesar Stanley Tucci PERIOD The reinventions of the tie that Peeta wore were particularly interesting though PERIOD

Mockingjay Part  is not an actionpacked thriller like the rest of the series PERIOD Its more of a melancholy contemplation on manipulation the horrors of war and the morality of inciting revolts PERIOD Although this less sensationalist focus should give the movie more weight there is no commitment to developing these themes PERIOD Whats more the film has the regrettable tendency of reiterating rather straightforward occurrences in a way that feels condescending PERIOD Despite this the movie is entertaining and ends on a dark cliffhanger that will make audiences hungry for Mockingjay Part  next November PERIOD
