MONDAY Aug PERIOD   HealthDay News  Black Americans diagnosed with a second primary cancer after their first one are more likely to die than their white peers PERIOD

Thats the takeaway from a new study by the American Cancer Society ACS PERIOD

Specifically it found that these Black patients have a  higher cancerrelated death rate than their white counterparts PERIOD Death rates due to heartrelated causes are  higher PERIOD

The researchers also found disparities for Hispanic patients hit by a second new cancer PERIOD Their cancerrelated death rates were  higher than those of white patients PERIOD

The disparities owed in part to later diagnosis among Black and Hispanic populations especially for breast cancer uterine cancer and melanoma lead author Hyuna Sung said in a society news release PERIOD Shes senior principal scientist of cancer surveillance research at ACS PERIOD

The findings highlight research priorities to address survival disparities among the growing population of multiple primary cancer survivors she said PERIOD

For the study the researchers used data from  U.S PERIOD health registries that included adults diagnosed with common second primary cancers representing more than  in  adultonset cases PERIOD

Among more than  people with second primary cancers more than  died of cancer and more than  of heartrelated causes during a median  months of followup PERIOD Median means half were studied longer half for less time PERIOD

The investigators looked at  types of second primary cancers PERIOD They found that compared with white individuals Black people had a higher risk of cancer death for  second primary cancer types PERIOD The widest gap was seen for survivors of second uterine cancers and for seven second primary cancer types among Hispanic people notably melanoma PERIOD

The risk of heartrelated death was higher among Black individuals with  second primary cancer types but generally lower among AsianPacific Islander and Hispanic populations than for white individuals PERIOD

Researchers looked at county attributes including household income and whether people lived in urban or rural environments PERIOD They also examined patients clinical characteristics including stage at diagnosis tumor subtypes and treatment PERIOD

When all those factors were taken into account racial and ethnic disparities narrowed substantially PERIOD

They said this highlights opportunities to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in survival rates PERIOD

Persons with multiple primary cancers may face unique challenges such as limited treatment options multiple chronic illnesses complexity in navigating health care systems and exacerbated financial hardship Sung said PERIOD Issues of financial hardship may be particularly relevant. lisa Lacasse president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the organization continues to push for health disparities to be addressed PERIOD It is seeking increased federal and state funding for early detection of breast and cervical cancer passage of federal prostate cancer screening legislation and advancement of proven tobacco control measures PERIOD

This also includes efforts to increase access to testing expand Medicaid coverage in  remaining states that have not yet adopted expansion support states to increase the reach of breast and cervical early detection programs and to remove financial barriers to prostate breast and cervical cancer screening for highrisk people PERIOD

Ending cancer as we know it requires public health interventions that ensure everyone has equitable access to quality affordable and timely access to prevention and early detection Lacasse said in the news release PERIOD

The study findings were published online Aug PERIOD  in JAMA Network Open PERIOD
