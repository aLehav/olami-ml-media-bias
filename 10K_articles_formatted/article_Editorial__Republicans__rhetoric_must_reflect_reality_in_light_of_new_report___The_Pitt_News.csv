Forget the Fugitive Slave Act of  Obamacare is the most dangerous piece of legislation passed in congress according to Republican Congressman John Fleming PERIOD

This is the kind of rhetoric from the Republican Party that we have become accustomed to since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare PERIOD Yet according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office a nonpartisan government agency that researches and provides economic data to congress the forecast outlining the effects of the bill do not match the perils Republicans say it will bring PERIOD

In fact according to the report the bill will cost the government far less over the next decade than previously suspected  about  billion less actually PERIOD The CBO projects that federal spending will fall by  billion in  on insurance premium subsidies and by  billion over the next ten years PERIOD Furthermore within three years Obamacare will apparently cut the number of uninsured Americans in half while at the same time decrease deficits and government healthcare spending as a percentage of gross domestic product PERIOD

So that means Republican rhetoric is set to cool off right Not necessarily PERIOD The party has already built campaigns upon demonizing Obamacare and has long anticipated that the presumed failure of the bill will allow them to retake the senate and gain even more seats in the house PERIOD It may seem hard for them to stop the train they have put in motion but hitting the breaks is necessary PERIOD

Their once supposedly foolproof political strategy in taking over congress will most likely be forcibly derailed by this report PERIOD That is if Republicans do not change the way they frame the bill and acknowledge the social benefits Obamacare will bring there will be longterm adverse political consequences for the partys public image and the American publics understanding of important legislation PERIOD

Of course thats not to say that the right wing ideologues will not continue to support campaigns against Obamacare but rather to say that Republicans should be worried about a constituency who will according to the CBO report be positively effected by the bill PERIOD The benefits that the bill is predicted to bring have the potential to ignite an enthusasim in constiuents to go vote against those trying to take said benefits away PERIOD And furthermore the bill also has the potential to sway moderates who were once wary of Obamacare towards the left PERIOD

Republicans made the mistake of using devilterm rhetoric to categorize social security something that legislators would never dream of getting rid of today PERIOD The Obamacare debate is leaving Republicans on a dangerous path toward repeating history PERIOD

Obamacare is not shaping up to be the weapon Republicans wanted it to be PERIOD After all polls in senator races in Louisiana Arkansas and Alaska are already showing augmented support for incumbent democrats PERIOD

That being the case Republicans need to have their rhetoric match the numbers because the numbers also happen to be a portion of their voters  the people gaining from the Affordable Care Act PERIOD If not the party will not only lose support but the public will also lose a party acting productively for its best interests PERIOD

Therefore Republicans must change their message PERIOD The last thing the party and public need is a greater voter disillusionment and confusion as a result of antigovernment and antipolicy rhetoric PERIOD
