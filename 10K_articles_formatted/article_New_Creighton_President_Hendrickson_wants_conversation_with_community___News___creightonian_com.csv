The Rev PERIOD Daniel S PERIOD Hendrickson S.J. creighton Universitys twenty-fifth president returned to his Nebraska roots seeking conversation adjusting to new responsibilities and exploring the Universitys potential PERIOD

On July  Fr PERIOD Hendrickson stepped into office as president succeeding the Rev PERIOD Timothy Lannon S.J. who stepped down from his presidency in January because of health concerns PERIOD

Fr PERIOD Hendrickson explained the transition between Dec PERIOD  when he was named president and July  as very thorough and instructive PERIOD During that time he traveled between Creighton and Marquette University where he served as associate provost of academic initiatives PERIOD

While Fr PERIOD Hendrickson was anxious and excited to get rooted in one place he said the most exciting part has been the start of the new school year PERIOD

To have the university in full motion alive with its teaching and learning and living is just absolutely thrilling Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD

However this isnt Fr PERIOD Hendricksons first time seeing Creightons campus in action PERIOD In fact he has experienced life at Creighton through three different perspectives as a student an instructor and a trustee PERIOD Now returning as president Fr PERIOD Hendrickson recalls the familiar hospitality of campus PERIOD

Its the friendliness I remember from my time as a student here  years ago and a faculty member here  years ago Hendrickson said PERIOD The Creighton family is still so good to be part of. each insertion into the university has given Fr PERIOD Hendrickson a unique perspective of being part of the Creighton family PERIOD

It was Creighton where he spent a year as a student and where he said he came alive as a philosopher and as a working Jesuit PERIOD

The kind of teaching I received at Creighton during my time as a young Jesuit is the teaching Ive tried to emulate in my own career of teaching in other places Hendrickson said PERIOD

As a trustee Fr PERIOD Hendrickson reconnected with staff and faculty from years past but he also met the leadership team at Creighton PERIOD He said he saw firsthand their investment in the future and the life of the institution PERIOD

Good Conversation

As the president of a Jesuit university Fr PERIOD Hendrickson seeks what he considers a crucial component to higher education discussion PERIOD

I ask for good conversation from people about their experience of Creighton University  both what they want from the University what their concerns are and the kinds of issues they think are important Hendrickson said PERIOD I want to know what are the concerns the hopes the struggles and the dreams of the students but also the faculty and staff. one way Fr PERIOD Hendrickson has been able to jumpstart this conversation is through social media PERIOD In just two months Fr PERIOD Hendrickson has gained more than  followers on Twitter and more than  fans on Facebook PERIOD

With students in particular I want to connect in very genuine ways and I want to be accessible PERIOD There will be limitations about how I can be accessible because of the demands of the job Hendrickson said PERIOD But I think Creighton is a very personal experience and higher education should be a personal experience. fr PERIOD Hendrickson hopes that social media will only complement this personal experience PERIOD

I want it to be a way of connecting with people but only as a way to start conversations Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD I think Twitter in particular if I can showcase where I am and whom Im with it offers one dimension of transparency. arts  Sciences senior Marc Cubrich was a Welcome Week executive PERIOD According to Cubrich Fr PERIOD Hendrickson was involved in many capacities of the new student orientation PERIOD

During movein he greeted many students  It was great to see him interact with so many students on a personal level Cubrich said PERIOD

Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said people at his former institution remember him for good listening and for good questions and he wants to continue this as president of Creighton PERIOD

Marquette Universitys Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Gary Meyer was a colleague of Fr PERIOD Hendrickson in the Office of the Provost and worked closely with him on a project PERIOD

Fr PERIOD Hendrickson was a very good listener and made it a point to personally connect with students faculty and staff Meyer said PERIOD He always found time to engage others and very much seemed to enjoy those interactions. new Responsibilities

With a new title comes new responsibilities PERIOD Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said that while he was aware of the complexity of a college presidency he was surprised by the good amount of public energy that has been involved PERIOD

I love meeting people and being in crowds but I also love to read and to think and this job leans into the public realm so much Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD Its been a balancing act and Ive had to work hard to get that kind of time for reading and thinking and praying. the typical day for Fr PERIOD Hendrickson is filled with meetings and conversations most are oneonone with faculty and staff PERIOD Many evenings involve external engagements with friends of the university and people who are interested in learning more about his vision as president and the needs of the institution PERIOD According to Fr PERIOD Hendrickson days are long full and very rewarding PERIOD

A busy life always offers one the opportunity to be mindful of good and meaningful prayer PERIOD But this job is also letting me function as a priest by saying mass and speaking meaningfullyFr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD

According to Fr PERIOD Hendrickson the Jesuit community has offered him tremendous spiritual support PERIOD Many of Fr PERIOD Hendricksons Jesuit brothers he has known for most of his life as a Jesuit PERIOD

Looking Ahead

While Fr PERIOD Hendrickson hopes Creighton continues to be an institution of higher education that is strong in teaching and allows for personal experience he also sees room for growth PERIOD

I think there are ways we can grow with global perspective Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD Creighton has a remarkable presence on the global stage but I think its time to take another step Im not sure what that means yet but I hope the students faculty and staff and I can talk about some possibilities for global perspective and engagement. in addition to this Fr PERIOD Hendrickson hopes to see the humanities recognized as a vital part of Creighton University PERIOD

We have great fields of experience in the health sciences law business Fr PERIOD Hendrickson said PERIOD But the humanities represent something essential of

Jesuit education. the study of philosophy and history language and literature he added PERIOD These are something that make a lawyer a Creighton lawyer a businesswoman a Creighton businesswoman a dentist a

Creighton dentist. arts  Sciences junior Peter Goeckner also worked alongside Fr PERIOD Hendrickson during Welcome Week and said Creighton has a lot to look forward to PERIOD
