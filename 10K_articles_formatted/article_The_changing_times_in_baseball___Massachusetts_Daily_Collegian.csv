Sitting on my fathers lap watching the  World Series between the New York Mets and the Boston Red Sox is one of my earliest memories PERIOD We yelled at the TV and jumped up and down as the ball rolled under Bill Buckners glove and the Mets took Game  and a game later the Series PERIOD
 I dont think Ive ever been as excited about a baseball game as I was that night PERIOD Maybe its because I was four and everyone else was excited or maybe its because baseball just isnt that much fun anymore PERIOD
 It seems that rivalries are now being created for controversy rather than the actual quality of the matchup PERIOD Games between topnotch teams are overshadowed by the possibility of a benchclearing brawl PERIOD Both the media and the fans spend more time covering and talking about fights and fines than the actual game PERIOD
The Red Sox have a chance to go to the World Series for the first time in  years PERIOD They have a solid set of starting pitchers and their relievers are finally settling down and coming into their own PERIOD On a good day their lineup is devastating as everyone in the order can hit one over the fence some are even known for doing it in clutch situations PERIOD
But if the Sox dont make it to the World Series this season it wont be because the Yankees are better or because of  the curse. itll be because theyve forgotten what its all about PERIOD
 It isnt about baseball anymore PERIOD It seems that the only things that are important to many of the players are their paychecks their pride and their precious egos PERIOD
Saturdays ALCS game at Fenway Park was set to be a battle between Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens arguably two of the greatest arms in baseball PERIOD Unfortunately it turned into a brawl of costly proportions PERIOD
My dad and I were in our usual spots parked in front of the TV ready for what we anticipated to be a pitchers duel PERIOD It was definitely a pitchers duel but not the type we had envisioned PERIOD Because of the attention this infamous rivalry has been getting in recent years the players are looking for reasons to fight PERIOD
Karim Garcia had some words with Martinez when a pitch flew over his back and popped up off his bat PERIOD In retaliation Garcia took out Sox second basemen Todd Walker igniting the flame PERIOD Words were exchanged as Pedro threatened to hit Yankee catcher Jorge Posada in the head PERIOD
The tension remained high into the bottom half of the fourth when Manny Ramirez overreacted to a high pitch from Clemens and stepped toward the mound  the fire began to spread PERIOD The benches cleared and 72yearold Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer charged at Martinez PERIOD Zimmer took a swing and Martinez grabbed his head and threw him to the ground PERIOD
Amazingly nobody was ejected from the game PERIOD My father and I kept watching as Clemens struck out Ramirez and the Sox blew every chance they had at a comeback PERIOD
Baseball Americas pastime has remained strong through tremendous amounts of turmoil PERIOD The sport has thrived through two World Wars segregation and numerous strikes and protests PERIOD Avid supporters and lifelong fans are giving up on their teams and in some cases the sport in general because short of a fight theres no thrill anymore PERIOD
Ive never been as disgusted as I was Sunday night when I turned on Sportscenter to see Zimmer a former Red Sox manager crying while he apologized for his embarrassing behavior during Saturdays game PERIOD Thats what baseball has become an abundance of apologies fines and brawls PERIOD A sport that has been there through a century worth of problems has always given Americans something to rely on something to be proud of PERIOD
After the past few seasons my interest in a sport that Ive spent my entire life watching has begun to dwindle PERIOD I cant support and appreciate a sport where the players lack heart PERIOD Id rather spend my time watching a little league game than a major league one PERIOD Little leaguers play because they love it because every time they step on that field theyre happy PERIOD I cant say that the guys in the majors dont feel that way but if they do I cant tell anymore PERIOD
Those little boys play each game with everything they have hoping to one day make it in the pros like their idols PERIOD What are they supposed to think when they sit down to watch a game and they all the see are their idols swearing and throwing punches at other players
Baseball has altered over the years evolving with an everchanging society sometimes for the better but recently for the worse if things continue in the direction theyre headed Americas pastime will become just that  a thing of the past PERIOD
I miss that feeling I had in  I miss how exciting it was to sit in front of a game and really care about the outcome PERIOD I miss how much fun I had watching each game pitchbypitch never once turning my attention away PERIOD I knew every statistic there was to know about my team and I loved watching the same players do great things year after year PERIOD
Its different now PERIOD Baseball is something I put on while Im doing other things PERIOD I keep it on the other channel so I have something to click to when the show Im watching goes to commercial PERIOD I wish I could sit down in front of a game with the same butterflies and anticipation I once had PERIOD Maybe things will change and the focus will go back to the game and how amazing it is and maybe Ill click back PERIOD
