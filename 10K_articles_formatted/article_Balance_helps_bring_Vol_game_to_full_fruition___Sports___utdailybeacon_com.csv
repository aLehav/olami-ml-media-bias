Be led by your dreams not pushed by your problems PERIOD

Jerry Green couldnt have chosen a more appropriate statement to use in

rallying his team this season PERIOD As Tennessee stood at  the dreams of an

NCAA bid were being overshadowed by a plethora of problems questions and

unmet expectations PERIOD

Now at  the Vols are all but a lock for the big dance and the only

question remaining is how much this team can accomplish before then PERIOD

Take care of small opportunities and they may lead to bigger ones PERIOD

The Vols have taken that advice as well and after compiling a fivegame

winning streak including a threegame road tear Tennessee finds itself in

its biggest game in recent history a Sunday showdown against Kentucky

Noon CBS for the SEC Eastern Division title PERIOD

 Green

said explaining that the game has been completely sold out PERIOD Hes right PERIOD It

would probably be easier to find someone who still thinks the earth is flat

than one empty seat in ThompsonBoling on Sunday PERIOD

So how in the world did this team get here anyway Thats a good question PERIOD

It seems like yesterday that I was writing about how this squad couldnt

win on the road couldnt come from behind and couldnt get it all

together PERIOD

Over the last couple of weeks the Vols have won three on the road come

from behind twice and have consistently shown up to play PERIOD Im not sure I

have all the answers but it all has to do with a balanced and steady

offense according to Green PERIOD

 he

said PERIOD 

Rashard Lee could lead a step aerobics class what with the number of times

hes stepped up over the last couple of games PERIOD He sparked the Vols with 

against South Carolina last week and poured in  more against Georgia in a

 win Tuesday PERIOD

Brandon Wharton and Tony Harris have resurrected the strong back court play

of a year ago by taking over recently PERIOD Wharton had  secondhalf points in

a comeback win over Ole Miss PERIOD Harris went 4for4 from 3point range with

 points against the Gamecocks PERIOD The duo each scored  points in the win

at Georgia and kept the Bulldogs on their heels all night PERIOD

Meanwhile C.J PERIOD Black has stepped up his production in the interior and

Isiah Victor has continued to contribute giving UT one of the best

insideoutside games around PERIOD Mix that with possibly the best defense in the

conference and it makes a lot of sense why the Vols have made a turn for

the better PERIOD

But before we all join hands and sing   or some other motivational feelgood song lets consider whats to

come PERIOD Sundays game is huge colossal monumental well you get the

picture PERIOD

Tennessee doesnt have the luxury of savoring its recent accomplishments PERIOD

If the Vols are to beat Kentucky again they have to come in hungry PERIOD This

shouldnt be a problem if UT brings the attitude it first showed in that

onepoint win at Rupp Arena and has since developed over the last five

games PERIOD

 Green

said PERIOD

Relatively competitive Thats pretty much the outlook of the national

media who still dont have any intentions of returning their preseason

praises to the Vols PERIOD

Not that UT has to care about that kind of thing but Sunday is a great

opportunity to regain that respect and solidify the team as a contending

force in the SEC and NCAA tournaments PERIOD

With two wins over Kentucky in the same season Tennessee could do just

that which leads to one final piece of wisdom for the Vols as they try to

establish themselves You may have to fight a battle more than once to win

it PERIOD
