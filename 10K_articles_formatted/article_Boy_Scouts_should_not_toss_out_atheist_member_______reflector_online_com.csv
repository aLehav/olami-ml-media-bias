Updated November     pm



The Boy Scouts of America is exercising its right to ban or toss out certain members of its group again PERIOD Darrell Lambert is a 19yearold from Seattle who has devoted  years to serving in the BSA PERIOD His accomplishments include becoming an Eagle Scoutthe highest rank in scoutingand attaining  merit badges PERIOD He has been given an ultimatum  The BSA is a private organization so it is entitled to cut members for various reasonsnamely homosexuality and atheism PERIOD Lambert is guilty of the latter PERIOD

Brad Farmer the executive of the Chief Seattle Council of the Boy Scouts said 

The Boy Scouts require potential members to fill out an application denoting religious preference be it a structured religion or simply belief in a greater presence PERIOD

It seems ridiculous to condone virtually all religions which could lead a persons moral behavior in countless different directions but forbid atheism which relies on the use of a personal moral compass PERIOD

I reason that the BSAs requirement for belief in a higher power is meant to teach humility and servitude but Lamberts service record speaks for itself PERIOD It boasts over  community service hours his senior year of high school alone and several leadership positions with the BSA PERIOD Lambert illustrates that an atheist is capable of serving a cause and making moral decisions PERIOD

Lambert has stated adamantly that he would not change his beliefs which he has held since his freshman year of high school PERIOD

If Lambert decided to remain a member of the Boy Scouts he would be one of two things a liar or someone who is very easily persuaded to compromise their beliefs PERIOD

The idea of compromising beliefs stands in stark contrast to BSA ideals which list mental awareness and selfreliance as two of their most emphasized principles PERIOD By affording Lambert the opportunity to change the BSA is in reality compromising its moral beliefs PERIOD

The religious requirements of the BSA teach closedmindedness and conformity to young members PERIOD By imposing its will on Lambert the BSA extends the message that conformity to a common idea will be rewarded with acceptance PERIOD As long as Boy Scouts personal beliefs are condemned and threatened with the possibility of expulsion they will not be able to achieve openmindedness PERIOD

The BSA shouldnt be forced to maintain Lambert as a member PERIOD Legally they have the right to admit or exclude certain people PERIOD The BSA should however respect Lamberts achievements as a Boy Scout commitment to serving others and advocacy of what he believes PERIOD Maybe the BSA will realize what an asset Lamberts intellect and selfless attitude are to its organization and allow him to stay despite his lack of spirituality PERIOD
