AntiWalMart activists are at it again PERIOD Their latest target is a WalMart store set toopen in Sherman Heights PERIOD The antiWalMart activists claim they dont want the store replacing the historic Farmers Market building PERIOD Yet the protest seems to be more about con deming WalMart using misleading information than disputing the actual construction site PERIOD

Similar to many other WalMart protests the rally on Sept PERIOD  was filled with activists holding propaganda signs portraying the company as the root of all evil PERIOD This included signs reading The top  percent hurts the other  percent. other than being old theres nothing historic about the Farmers Market building PERIOD Its not a major landmark of any sort and the building doesnt have eyeopening architecture PERIOD In fact it was vacant before WalMart began construction PERIOD Given the buildings age its better to tearit down and replace it PERIOD Furthermore Sherman Heights needs a grocery and retail store PERIOD The new WalMart will offer fresh produce meat dairy and frozen and dry foods PERIOD This will save gas money for local residents who would otherwise drive longer distances to the nearest grocery store PERIOD It will also save residents the hassle of going through downtown traffic to get to Horton Plaza for their other shopping needs PERIOD

Most WalMart critics point to the companys labor policy specifically low wages poor health care benefits for employees outsourcing jobs overseas and antilabor union tactics PERIOD Many of these claims are exaggerated and misleading PERIOD Labor unions for example love to complain about WalMart only insuring  percent of its employees yet they dont men tion only  percent of employees in the retail industry receive health benefits from their employers PERIOD However according to the Washington Post95 percent of WalMart employees have some form of health insurance through the company a family memer or the government PERIOD

Hypocritical WalMart opponentsdont tell you the companys major competitors use the same policies PERIOD I used to work for Target WalMarts primary competitor PERIOD In the brief time I worked there as a retail sales associate I was paid minimum wage had no health benefits and was shown a biased antilabor union video twice PERIOD In fact WalMarts pay scale which ranges from . to . per hour is higher than Targets range of . to . pERIOD Despite treating em ployees in a way no better than WalMart Target gets a free pass from critics on its labor policy because its viewed as the good corporate citizen PERIOD

This double standard is even extended overseas PERIOD Other retail com panies such as Sears Kmart and J.C PERIOD Penney employ workers from sweatshops in China PERIOD Some provide worse pay and work conditions than WalMart PERIOD Workers in a J.C PERIOD Penney sweatshop work as many as  hours per week for as little as  cents per hour PERIOD For the same sweatshop job WalMart pays  cents per hour with a workload of  hours per week PERIOD These stats are nothing to brag about for either company but critics dont mention Chinese wages prices and the cost of living are much lower than in the U.S PERIOD

I would love to see labor unions attack the entire retail industry as aggressively as they do WalMart instead of just trying to pick on the easiest target PERIOD Perhaps then we could have good paying jobs at all major retail stores PERIOD None of WalMarts competitors will instantly reform their labor policies if the unions attackjust one store PERIOD Labor unions grumble about WalMarts antiunion policy without making a legitimate effort to unionize its workers PERIOD

Labor unions and other critics seem to miss the point about the lowwage jobs WalMart and other retail outlets provide PERIOD There are homeless people squatting acrossthe street from the construction site who would benefit from having a job in the industry PERIOD Any job they could get would be better than the position theyre in now PERIOD Firsttime job seekers and college students benefit from the job experience and flexible schedules PERIOD People who arent qualified or unable to get other jobs such as high school dropouts and the elderly rely on jobs in the retail and fastfood industries to make a living PERIOD

WalMart is by no means a model corporate citizen but dont buy into the antiWalMart hysteria just because its the loudest PERIOD",Wal-Mart protests cheapen real labor issues â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
