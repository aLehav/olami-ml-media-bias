Living in a college town where neighbors can be loud and obnoxious it might be tempting to march over and confront the offending party or just call the police and have them deal with it PERIOD Often students ask themselves is it time to call the cops or is it time to emulate Queen Elsa from Disneys Frozen and just let it go

Griffin Uchida coordinator for leadership academic and diversity initiatives at WSU said that in residence halls and university apartments the biggest complaints that usually arise are violations of community expectations primarily noise PERIOD

The ideal situation is for the person with the concern to talk to their neighbor Uchida said PERIOD

Uchida said the most direct solution is to discuss the problem with the neighbor PERIOD However if students feel uncomfortable or unsafe doing that the best bet is to contact their RA apartment manager or landlord or in the worst case scenario call the police PERIOD

What we do not want is for you to go over to the offending apartment thats having a loud party and cause a confrontation said Police Operations Cmdr PERIOD Chris Tennant PERIOD If you are uncomfortable contacting them then call the cops with a noise complaint PERIOD We go on noise complaints every day all times of the day and contact neighbors for you. tennant said even if the noise complaint or situation turns out to be trivial calling the police may be the safer option PERIOD

If you are a reasonable person and you call for a reasonable belief you are fine Tennant said PERIOD If you repeatedly call  for nonemergency stuff that is a crime. if a student is suspicious that there may be something illegal occurring or a domestic abuse situation next door calling the police is the best option PERIOD

If you dont know who they are you dont know what the situation is and you dont know how youre going to be received thats the time to call the police Tennant said PERIOD

Leaving an anonymous tip with an RA or the police is always an option as well PERIOD

If they do call either party theres no judgement that we give like you should have addressed it yourselves said Edwin Hamada director of Residence Life PERIOD

Hamada said the best long term solution to solving conflicts with neighbors is discussing the issue with the landlord or apartment manager but in the short term calling the police or having a discussion with the neighbor is the most appropriate response PERIOD

If it turns out to be something like a drunken argument over whose turn it is to shoot the pools thats fine too Tennant said PERIOD The police dont care that it turned out to be something else PERIOD If you suspect something is going amiss and violence is involved thats when you call the cops. news
