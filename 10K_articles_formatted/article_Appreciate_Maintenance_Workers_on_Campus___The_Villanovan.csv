7766,2023-10-04,"how often were you doing laundry when you realized that either a dryer or washer was broken Did you decide to come back later and hope that they would be working again or did you take the time to put in a maintenance request Most of us can agree that taking the time to find the form and fill it out is annoying especially if you are busy or are trying to finish errands PERIOD

However this is something that somebody has to do or maintenance will never know there is an issue PERIOD Maintenance requests usually happen at the beginning of the school year when most students are moving into new dorms PERIOD

According to one of Austin Halls RAs maintenance tries to complete room checks before students move in to complete requests as early as possible PERIOD Most of these early requests will involve visible issues like ceiling tiles or broken towel rods PERIOD For the smaller details that get missed students are encouraged to fill out the form as soon as possible so maintenance can tackle many requests at once PERIOD

Although most students are willing to put in requests for their own room how often do they put in requests for outside issues Having broken washers and dryers for a few days is a common occurrence in most dorms PERIOD The Villanovan spoke with Gerremy Ferguson an RA from Alumni Hall about how often students ask him to put in requests PERIOD He said that most students tend to handle requests themselves and do not ask him too often especially in dorms with older students PERIOD However he noticed that students would wait until it became a large inconvenience PERIOD Once there was a bigger issue they would come to him for the request PERIOD This observation was shared by Austin Hall RA Isabella Quatela as well PERIOD

Why do students wait to put in outside maintenance requests One possibility is the inconvenience of the form itself PERIOD Maintenance can only fix known issues so making it easier to submit requests could improve the process PERIOD Would putting the form as a link on the NovaNow app encourage students to submit requests faster

Another issue is the mindset that somebody else will put in the request eventually so why put in the effort PERIOD If the problem is related to something used by many students like laundry or showers somebody will eventually submit a request PERIOD This has allowed many students to put off making requests which forces everyone to wait longer PERIOD

This occurrence stems from not having the request form easily accessible so fixing that issue could encourage students to submit requests faster PERIOD Finally what requires a maintenance request varies by student PERIOD For some they can survive with a broken thermostat or ceiling tiles but others would want those issues addressed PERIOD Between these different reasons many requests do not get submitted PERIOD

In conclusion maintenance requests are an important aspect of campus life that often gets overlooked PERIOD The maintenance team is an incredible group that wants to see students safe and successful and are often not appreciated PERIOD

Next time you put in a request make sure you acknowledge that somebody must come to fix all the problems that occur in a dorm so you can have the best dorm and college experience PERIOD Finally if you usually wait for something to get fixed I encourage you to be the one to submit a request PERIOD

Not only will your issue be solved faster but youll also know when it gets fixed PERIOD Additionally it gives you the chance to take care of your dorm PERIOD Maintenance requests are a simple solution to the neverending problems that occur with dorm life so take advantage of the system to improve your Villanova experience PERIOD
