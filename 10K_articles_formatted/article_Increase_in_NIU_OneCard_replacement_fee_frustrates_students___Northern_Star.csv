By  Jermaine PigeeFebruary  

DeKALB  Some NIU students are expressing their dismay for the recent price increase of the NIU OneCard from  to  PERIOD

I think the price should be whatever it costs to make the card plus whatever it costs to hire a desperate unemployed computer science student to change the code in the computer said Alice Stoicescu a senior electrical engineering major PERIOD

They claim the price comes from the fact that they must change the number but I know some lawyers who dont make  every  minutes PERIOD The argument is kind of null Stoicescu said. to obtain or replace a OneCard students must go to the OneCard office on the ground floor of the Holmes Student Center PERIOD

If students have never obtained a OneCard the first card is free PERIOD

Otherwise students can pay for the card by cash check or by charging it to their bursars account PERIOD

I was never thrilled about the price to begin with PERIOD I was mad at myself because I constantly lost the OneCard and had to pay to get it replaced said senior English major Carolyn Storer PERIOD I know it is meant to be a punishment but it is just a piece of plastic PERIOD Other pieces of plastic like my drivers license are more valuable PERIOD It only costs five dollars to replace that PERIOD I think five dollars would be a fair price. you would still be getting punished for losing it and NIU would still make money off of your forgetfulness. kinga Mauger of the NIU Bursars Office said the raise in the OneCard price helps make the card PERIOD

This charge is related to the increased costs of producing new cards Mauger said PERIOD

This increase became effective in July PERIOD Last spring semester prior to the increase going into effect notices of the pending increase were posted on our Web site and at the OneCard office. mauger also said there hasnt been an increase in more than  years PERIOD

The fee has not previously been increased since the inception of the OneCard program in  Mauger said. advertisement
