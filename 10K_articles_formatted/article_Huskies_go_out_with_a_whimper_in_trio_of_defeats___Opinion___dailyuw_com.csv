Showers early then partly cloudy overnight PERIOD Low around 50F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD Chance of rain  PERIOD

Updated November     pm



One year after winning  of their first  games the Huskies arent off to quite so hot a start PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Washington softball team underperformed for the second time in as many tournaments this weekend losing three of its five games at the Campbell Cartier Classic in San Diego Calif PERIOD Now sitting at  the Huskies are off to their worst start since  and have lost five games earlier than any team in school history PERIOD

The UW scored just two total runs in its losses last weekend to No PERIOD  Kentucky No PERIOD  Oklahoma and unranked Cal Poly PERIOD The teams pitchers surrendered no more than three runs in any game but the Husky offense couldnt find its stride against outstanding opposing pitching PERIOD

We had chances to win but its a fine line between achieving the winning runs and not taking advantage of opportunities head coach Heather Tarr said PERIOD We just didnt get the hits when we needed them. fridays matchup with Kentucky  was the start of a threegame skid PERIOD Kelsey Nunley  manned the circle for the Wildcats as the Huskies couldnt complete their comeback from a threerun deficit losing  and leaving a runner stranded in the final inning PERIOD

Sophomore starter Kasey Stanchek  allowed all three Kentucky runs while her Huskies struggled to convert offensively in their second of what is now three losses this season to ranked opponents PERIOD

On Saturday the UW proceeded to go scoreless across both games of its doubleheader managing just six total hits in a pair of  losses at the hands of Oklahoma  and Cal Poly  PERIOD

Again the Husky pitching wasnt at fault PERIOD Junior Bryana Walker  held her own on the mound against the Sooners giving up two earned runs in six innings pitched PERIOD Classmate Kaitlin Inglesby  yielded one earned run to the Mustangs while pitching all seven innings PERIOD

Tarr identified her teams performance in the batters box as crucial heading into the weekend and the Huskies lack of firepower led to a disappointing tournament PERIOD Inglesby first baseman Hooch Fagaly and center fielder Kylee Lahners  the third fourth and fifth hitters in the UW lineup  combined to go 4of23 at the plate in the teams three losses PERIOD

For a lot of the upperclassmen they know your career is short and you have to have a sense of urgency about how you compete at each atbat Tarr said PERIOD Were all frustrated that we couldnt make it happen in the clutch. there were however some positives to take away from the weekend PERIOD On Friday the UW won  against Notre Dame PERIOD And in their weekend finale the Huskies easily handled UC Riverside  behind the arm of Walker on Sunday PERIOD

Amid all the frustration at the plate was consistent pitching from Walker and the rest of the UW staff PERIOD The Huskies allowed less than two runs per game for the weekend which gives Tarr hope her group can recover from its slow start to the season PERIOD

Were getting good pitching performances and having opportunities with runners in scoring position Tarr said PERIOD Anytime you face good pitching and have chances to win thats all you can ask for. but it wont get any easier for the Huskies PERIOD Before the UW delves into the loaded Pac12 schedule in late March it still must face No PERIOD  Texas No PERIOD  Georgia and No PERIOD  Michigan PERIOD

Weve already faced a tough schedule and were going to continue with that tough schedule Tarr said PERIOD But thats what we need PERIOD We need to learn our lesson early on. reach reporter Justin Lester at sportsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter JLsmooth23
