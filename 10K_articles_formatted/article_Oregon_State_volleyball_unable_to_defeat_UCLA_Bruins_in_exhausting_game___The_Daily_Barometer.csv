Audrey Anderson Sports ContributorNovember  

The Oregon State Womens Volleyball team fought against UCLA Bruins Sunday afternoon at Gill Coliseum eventually losing in four sets  PERIOD

With it being the last home game of the season the Beavers were hoping to pull off a win and gain some momentum before facing off against No PERIOD 8ranked Stanford and No PERIOD 12ranked Oregon PERIOD

The Beavers started strong implementing mindblowing techniques and exhibiting incredible prowess PERIOD Kinley Swan the freshman middle blocker for OSU from Orem Utah had the Bruins running every which way expertly switching between tip power spike and fake PERIOD

A long break occurred during the first set due to an error with the scorecard PERIOD During the break Oregon States Keira Herron the freshman libero from College Station Texas decided to pump up her teammates and the crowd by whipping out some incredible dance moves PERIOD

With volleyball paused the battle between the Beavers and the Bruins continued uniquely with a backandforth of dance moves PERIOD Benny the Beaver made a guest appearance shutting down the Bruins with a cartwheel and the infamous worm move PERIOD

Even with the encouraging dance moves from Keira Herron and the rest of the OSU team the UCLA Bruins found their drive at the end of the first set coming back and ultimately winning PERIOD The leaping saves from Mackenzie Cole the Libero from Long Island New York and the zooming spikes from Iman Ndiaye the outside hitter from Dallas Texas proved to be too tough of a match for the Beavers PERIOD

The second set proved a challenge to the Bruins with multiple mistakes including fouls from touching the net and confusion about who should get the ball PERIOD Meanwhile the Beavers found their footing and with a joint effort from the team were able to win the second set PERIOD

Kateryna Tkachenko the sophomore outside hitter from Lubny Ukraine struck fear within the Bruins by firing the ball just out of reach of the players hands PERIOD Tkachenko made a host of blocks along with her vicious spikes inspiring her team to continue with their pointwinning streak PERIOD

The third set gave way to long volleys between the two teams with both teams fighting to their wits end PERIOD Cries of frustration and cheers of jubilation rang out amongst the players as points were won and lost PERIOD With both teams refusing to give up a single point the set continued past the regular twentyfive points PERIOD

The crowd was on their feet roaring for the OSU Beavers as the third set continued into the 30s point range but the UCLA Bruins ended up clinching the win exhausting the Beavers PERIOD

Although the Bruins struggled with serving throughout the fourth the Beavers could not gain momentum from the grueling thirdset loss ultimately giving the Bruins the win PERIOD

Unable to bounce back from Fridays loss the Oregon State Beavers are heading into the two final games of the season on a ninegame losing streak PERIOD
