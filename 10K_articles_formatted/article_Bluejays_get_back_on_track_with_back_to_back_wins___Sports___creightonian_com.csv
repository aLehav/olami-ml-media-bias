The Creighton baseball team poured on the runs over the weekend as it bested the Minnesota Golden Gophers in a threegame series PERIOD After losing the first game  the Jays won the next two  and  PERIOD With the victories the Jays improved to  on the season PERIOD

Our level of play was much improved against Minnesota over the previous weekend at Little Rock head coach Ed Servais said PERIOD Our effort energy and execution were noticeably better especially Sunday PERIOD I think we showed the type of team that we hope to be throughout the season. the Jays came out hot on Friday afternoon scoring four runs in the first inning PERIOD An RBI triple from junior infielder Jake Peter followed by three RBI singles gave the Jays the early lead PERIOD In the third inning the Jays added another run as sophomore outfielder Brett Murray singled to score sophomore infielder Reagan Fowler PERIOD

The Jays held a  lead until the bottom of the fifth inning when the Gophers scored six runs off of two hits and five walks PERIOD Down  the Jays rallied in the top of the seventh but could not capitalize leaving the bases loaded PERIOD The Gophers added three insurance runs in the bottom of the eighth inning en route to the  win PERIOD

Murray Fowler and senior outfielder Brad McKewon each finished with two hits Murray led the team with two RBIs PERIOD Fridays game was McKewons third multihit performance of the season PERIOD The Jays finished with nine hits and seven walks while striking out eight times. sophomore starting pitcher Taylor Elman went   innings allowing three earned runs off of three hits and four walks while recording three strikeouts PERIOD

On Saturday the Jays earned their first win of the season trouncing the Gophers  PERIOD The Jays struck in the first inning again plating two off of Peters home run PERIOD Up  in the second inning McKewon singled to right field scoring Murray to take a  lead PERIOD In the fourth inning the Jays piled up four runs off of three hits including a threerun home run from sophomore infielder Tommy Clouthier and jumped ahead  PERIOD

The Gophers plated two runs in the bottom of the fourth to shrink the lead to  but they were unable to gain any more ground on the Jays PERIOD Murray scored in the sixth this time off of a wild pitch and the Jays added three more insurance runs off of four hits and an error in the ninth to seal the victory PERIOD

Offensively we had a number of twoout base hits that is something we did not do well in Arkansas head coach Ed Servais said PERIOD Our defense improved greatly as well making only one error despite playing on dirt played on turf at ArkansasLittle Rock for the first time. the Jays had  hits and six walks in the victory with five players recording multihit games PERIOD Peter finished  with two RBIs and two runs PERIOD McKewon Fowler Murray and senior outfielder Mike Gerber finished with two hits apiece PERIOD The Gophers managed nine hits and three walks PERIOD

In the rubber match on Sunday the Jays dominated getting hot offensively while shutting out the Gophers as they cruised to an  victory PERIOD A threerun fifth inning and a fiverun ninth inning were all the Jays needed as the pitching staff only allowed four hits and zero walks in the game PERIOD

Freshman starting pitcher Jeff Albrecht went three innings while allowing two hits and striking out three PERIOD Sophomores Austin Groth John Oltman and Nick Highberger pitched the next five innings allowing only two hits combined PERIOD Sova pitched another scoreless ninth to seal the victory PERIOD Groth earned the win improving to  on the season PERIOD

Starting  was a wakeup call that we were not playing at the level we wanted to be at McKewon said PERIOD No one really was outstanding in the first weekend and I think we started to move in the right direction against Minnesota. the Jays will look to carry their momentum into their next series with the Charlotte 49ers PERIOD The 49ers are  on the season and will play two more games this week before taking on the Jays PERIOD The first game of the series is Friday at  p.m PERIOD in Charlotte PERIOD
