5308,2012-10-25,"faculty Senate action on the Alternative Review Process ARP cannot be taken until the ASSU legislative bodies pass a bill on it University officials confirmed Wednesday PERIOD

About  undergraduate students attended Wednesdays town hall on the ARP the second of two sessions cohosted by the ASSU Executive and the Office of Community Standards OCS which oversees ARP proceedings PERIOD

Senior University Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler also confirmed that the ARP was currently operating on University President John Hennessys power to intervene in judicial affairs in extraordinary circumstances. however she maintained that although the ARP does violate the rightsoftheaccused provision of the ASSU Constitution any contract is unenforceable if the contract violates federal law PERIOD The University has interpreted a failure to extend the ARP as a violation of the Dear Colleague letter thus making the constitutional provision unenforceable PERIOD

Were compelled by law to disregard the ASSU Constitution Schoenthaler said PERIOD Actually I would turn the question around and say Gosh ASSU arent you worried that the federal government is going to come talk to you about the fact that your constitution conflicts with Title IX

Both forums were entirely informational beyond what was implied by the intonation of questions no student directly expressed an opinion about any of the ARPs provisions PERIOD

It was a very educational night and I think that was the right way to go ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff  said PERIOD Im glad it didnt turn into strictly voicing whatever opinion you came in the room with because I think there were a lot of questions that might have helped people form more informed opinions. only one graduate student who was not affiliated with ASSU legislative bodies attended the graduate community forum on Tuesday PERIOD Also in attendance were three representatives from the University one member of the Graduate Student Council GSC and three representatives from the ASSU Executive PERIOD The forum lasted  minutes PERIOD

I think graduate students are generally harder to get to a physical location Zimbroff said PERIOD Graduate representatives were telling me  that we can do a better job soliciting input by email which we will do. wednesdays undergraduate forum lasted for well over an hour featuring a full presentation about the ARP by OCS Associate Director Jamie PontiusHogan PERIOD

PontiusHogan confirmed that the ARP will continue in its current form until it is approved or rejected by the Faculty Senate PERIOD However the Undergraduate Senate and GSC must pass a bill on ARP before it can be submitted to the Faculty Senate for review PERIOD Last years Undergraduate Senate deferred their decision to this years senators who have in turn delayed discussions until after this weeks town halls PERIOD

When a student asked what would happen if the Faculty Senate rejects the ARP PontiusHogan said she wasnt prepared to answer that question yet. previously Zimbroff had stated that he hoped the town halls would engage people in discussions about the ARP who would not have otherwise shown interest in the process PERIOD

We did try to reach out to people across campus in every corner and I hope that they came Zimbroff said PERIOD

Several students who attended said they appreciated the chance to ask questions and learn more about the process PERIOD

Im really glad to see so many people here because a lot of the debate around this hasnt seemed informed Leanna Keyes  said PERIOD For example I didnt know the extent to which Title IX impacted this and the fact that its not even an option to go back to the standard we used before we used preponderance of the evidence  really informs this debate for me. sarah Roberts  who works at the Womens Community Center said she believes the ARP is important because it is both less traumatizing for victims and brings assailants to justice PERIOD

Twothirds of rapists will rape again so its really a matter not of my personal safety but also of community safety she said PERIOD

Zimbroff and PontiusHogan encouraged students to give feedback via the online forms on the ASSU and the OCS websites PERIOD
