Infielder Melody Coombs  throws a ball she caught back to the pitchers mound before St PERIOD Francis can steal a base duringthe Penn State Softball vs PERIOD St PERIOD Francis on Tuesday Mar PERIOD   at Beard Field in University Park Pa PERIOD Penn State won  over the visiting team

Penn State is currently in the midst of a sevengame win streak following its  Tuesday victory over St PERIOD Francis PERIOD

The Nittany Lion defense stole the show throughout their latest contest with a fantastic diving catch by senior center fielder Lilia Crouthamel standing out as a particular highlight PERIOD

However perhaps the most interesting development from the game against the Red Flash was the way coach Clarisa Crowell utilized her pitching staff PERIOD

Crowell gave the starting nod in the game to senior Kylee Lingenfelter but after Lingenfelter allowed St PERIOD Francis lone score of the game in the second inning she was pulled in favor of junior Vanessa Oatley PERIOD

For Oatley this was only her third game back this season after coming off the injured list PERIOD Crowell seemed to take note of this and made sure to get Oatley some time on the field PERIOD

She hasnt thrown as many innings so I decided to get her a few innings in there Crowell said PERIOD

Oatley would see two innings before senior ace Bailey Parshall came in for the remaining three PERIOD

When asked about her thought process behind all these substitutions in the circle Crowell noted the schedule as the main reason for her changes PERIOD

Tonight you know its a midweek game its really more about getting our three kids who we need to get going Crowell said PERIOD This was more about making sure everybodys getting work in before the weekend. while Crowell seemed to focus mainly on her pitching rotation against St PERIOD Francis seeing the Nittany Lions use three pitchers has become a more routine sight recently PERIOD

The game against the Red Flash marked the sixth time in the month of March that Crowell went three deep into her bullpen PERIOD

Pitcher Bailey Parshall  pitchesduring Penn StateSoftballs double header against Rutgers on Saturday April tenth at Beard Field in University Park Pa. the Nittany Lions won the first game  and the second  against the Scarlet Knights PERIOD

And while the most recent two times the Nittany Lions utilized three pitchers ended in victories the earlier four contests ended in defeat PERIOD

Now its worth noting the beginning of the month proved much more difficult in terms of competition for Penn State compared to the past seven games PERIOD

However its also possible this midgame revolvingdoor approach is cause for some concern PERIOD

Penn State has been outscored  in games where they use three different pitchers PERIOD

And if you remove the teams 12run showing against UMassLowell that margin decreases even further for the blue and white PERIOD

Going forward the Nittany Lions season is approaching arguably its most important section PERIOD

As Big Ten play finally arrives this weekend against Maryland the question of if this bullpen flexibility is sustainable begs to be asked PERIOD

While Crowell didnt formally address that issue she nonetheless expressed confidence in her team as a whole ahead of the upcoming schedule PERIOD

Weve been battletested over and over this season Crowell said PERIOD Obviously you want to have a lot of momentum going into conference play and I think we have that right now. mORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE
