Dave Keplinger is a senior majoring in English and a columnist for The Daily Collegian PERIOD His column appears every other Friday PERIOD

My Opinion

As children we inevitably found them in our classrooms at the ballpark on the television PERIOD They were men women sometimes animal sometimes superhuman PERIOD They were our heroes PERIOD

As we changed so did they PERIOD Some of us saw our heroes fall to a sex scandal a common end to many celebrities today PERIOD The demise of Gary Hart and his promising presidential campaign serves as an example PERIOD

Some of us saw our heroes fall to other temptations PERIOD Pete Rose succumbed to gambling PERIOD We even saw some heroes heightened to the silver screen but put on such a pedestal against such hype even Batman couldnt survive a pop explosion PERIOD Now hes an album PERIOD A potential sequel PERIOD

Our nation seems to have lost the definition of or rather the ability to sustain a hero PERIOD A hero does not need media backing PERIOD His contribution can be as small as a gift to a needy person PERIOD A selfless act PERIOD

He does not need to dress in a uniform or wear a cape PERIOD But a hero does need to be consistent PERIOD He must never falter for if he does we will despise him PERIOD

When I was  I spent the summer in a small town outside Copenhagen Denmark PERIOD A friend from high school lived there and I had the opportunity to meet his family and friends PERIOD

I also had the opportunity to frequent the many bars around town one in particular Den Lille Cafe was a popular hangout for workers most of them mill and machine shop operators PERIOD

At eight oclock every night they shuffled in from the shop and drank off their day PERIOD My friend and I joined them sometimes and by the end of the night fairly drunk we walked back to the village together PERIOD

I became friends with one particular worker Isben PERIOD He had a young son and a wife but rarely spoke of them at the cafe PERIOD I thought he was heroic in every sense he worked hard for his family and though he was poor he found it in himself to laugh at his poverty PERIOD

One night before closing Isbens sixyearold son appeared from nowhere stepped up to our table and began dragging him from the stool PERIOD Isben kept yelling  but his son continued pulling until the stool toppled over smashing on the floor and bringing Isben down with it PERIOD

I realized then Isben was very drunk PERIOD But the most striking part of the picture was the boy PERIOD He had a sullen face like an old man PERIOD I could tell he had done this before PERIOD

Everyone in the bar was drunk I knew that PERIOD But I had never stopped to think every one of these men had a family and this was happening everywhere in the world PERIOD

At that moment I experienced the most enlightening and depressing moment in my life PERIOD A billion fallen heroes PERIOD Not just one baseball player or one crusader PERIOD A billion men PERIOD

Ive thought a lot about who my heroes are since then PERIOD Ive chosen them carefully like the best candy in the box sometimes Ive had to take half a taste before I throw them back PERIOD

I suppose picking a hero means choosing someone who reflects the best qualities of myself PERIOD Consistently the best of me PERIOD

Unfortunately thats led me to the conclusion there is no constant in a human world every Elvis could take to drugs every Ben Johnson could disappoint his fans PERIOD So Im forced to confront myself maybe change a little create a lesser version of the perfect me PERIOD

There are no heroes in America today PERIOD We only have people here the same as in Denmark or South Africa or Uganda PERIOD Men and women with ideals and weaknesses and fears PERIOD

So what shall we call these people What do we call a Rev PERIOD Tutu or a Mother Theresa We must call them equals for if we hold them too high we can never expect to reach that point ourselves PERIOD

A world without heroes is not a loss of innocence in fact we are gaining each other PERIOD We are gaining the knowledge that people are all we have that we must correct our own problems and strive to be our own supermen PERIOD

And though we may never be perfect if that knowledge means we must finally look ourselves in the mirror maybe it will do us good PERIOD

Maybe if we set our minds to it there might be a Batman we could really sing about PERIOD
