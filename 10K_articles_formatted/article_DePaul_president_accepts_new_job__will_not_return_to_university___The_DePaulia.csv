I was so disappointed to hear about Holtschneiders departure Manafova said PERIOD I know its my first year so I dont know him that well but when I met him at orientation he seemed like such a nice guy very caring about the students here and just the community in general. in spite of his personal disappointment Vekina said he is looking forward to seeing what Holtschneider does next in his new role PERIOD Still he wishes he could have accomplished one last goal before leaving DePaul for good PERIOD

All he wanted to do was make DePaul a welcoming place for everyone so I think that is what hes going to do in his next position Lekina said PERIOD But the selfish part of me is always going to be like what if I got to shake Father Holtschneiders hand when I graduate next year And I wont get to do that PERIOD Even thinking about that kind of gets me emotional. the Student News Site of DePaul University","DePaul president accepts new job, will not return to university - The DePaulia",DePaul University
