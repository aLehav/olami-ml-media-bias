Rahm Emanuel became Chicagos next mayor with a blowout victory in the Feb PERIOD  election taking  percent of the vote compared with a mere  percent by runnerup Gery Chico PERIOD However in a disheartening display of voter apathy only  percent of registered Chicago residents participated in that decision PERIOD

At a time when millions of people across the Middle East take to the streets and fight for a right to vote its sad to see the majority of Chicagoans take that same right for granted especially in such an important election PERIOD It was a momentous event in Chicago history marking the first time in decades longterm Mayor Richard M PERIOD Daley did not seek reelection and the first time in recent memory anyone other than a Daley had a realistic chance at office PERIOD After hearing Chicagoans complain for years about Daleys unending reign as the King of Chicago it was truly disappointing so few people were willing to come out to the polls once the opportunity to elect a new mayor finally arose PERIOD

Emanuels celebrity factor during the campaign probably played a big role in creating voter apathy PERIOD He dominated all election coverage particularly after his residency controversy PERIOD Emanuel managed to be the center of attention throughout the campaign without ever taking much of a solid stance on anything PERIOD It seems clear he will make some sweeping changes to city government PERIOD But beyond a few vague promises to cut spending and reduce the deficit its unclear what any of those changes will be PERIOD He had an overwhelming advantage in terms of campaign funds having raised more than  million for his mayoral bid while Chico and Carol Moseley Braun raised just above  million and  respectively PERIOD Many people assumed he had the election in the bag PERIOD

However the mayoral race was not the only thing decided on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD As of press time  new aldermen were elected to the City Council PERIOD Fourteen more aldermanic races will be resolved in the April  runoff elections giving Chicago voters one more chance to cast their ballots PERIOD These elections will give voters the chance to create some enormous changes in the City Councila chance they should not squander a second time by neglecting to vote PERIOD Aldermanic elections can impact specific neighborhoods and wards far more than the mayoral race so Chicagoans should pay close attention to these races and make their votes count come April PERIOD
