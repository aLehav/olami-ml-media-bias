5353,2013-01-18,"been sitting in your room wearing three pairs of socks and a ski coat We are suffering together PERIOD Miserable weather loves miserable company PERIOD Here are the top five worst things about January PERIOD



Clothes

Everyone always says the one good thing about winter is the clothes PERIOD This isnt even remotely true because no one sees the outfits PERIOD No one wants to take off their warm jackets so that cute outfit you spent so much time Not appreciated PERIOD Boys I know this is your numberone worry. darkness

The shorter amount of daylight does not induce happiness for anyone especially because most of us have classes during the few glorious hours of sunlight PERIOD This means most of us are just sitting inside on a campus where we all LOVE being active PERIOD It also makes it harder to get a good run in outside  although many would consider that a good thing PERIOD



Mornings

They become harder and harder PERIOD It is so difficult to get out of bed knowing that as soon as we move the cold will strike our bodies PERIOD For me this generally induces tears because I hate the cold so much PERIOD This just makes mornings that much more dreadful PERIOD



Temperature

Well PERIOD Its a nobrainer PERIOD But its cold PERIOD We chose Stanford for a number of reasons generally one of them was that California sunshine. i find myself repeating This is not what I signed up for Stanford as I whimper when I walk outside PERIOD



Class

The numberone reason why winter sucks definitely has to be those morning bike rides PERIOD I know I have made the mistake of leaving my gloves in my room too many times leading to numb fingers PERIOD At the same time tears are slowly leaking out of your eyes because of the crisp morning. all the tourists must think morning bikers are incredibly sad to be going to class PERIOD
