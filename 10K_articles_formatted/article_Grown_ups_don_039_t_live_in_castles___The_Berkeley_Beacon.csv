7878,2023-11-01,"i spent spring semester of last year gallivanting around Europe shacking up in various horrifying hostels on weekends and retreating to Emersons very own castle during the week PERIOD

Our largest stressors were trains planes and finding time to Skype with family and lovers a continent away PERIOD

We spent very little time worrying about our careers unlike Emersonians in Los Angeles where making inroads on a career is the point PERIOD Most castle dwellers as the program director Dulcia Meijers affectionately dubs us are sophomores and are not yet thinking about the rest of their life PERIOD And besides such a serious undertaking would have been out of place in between Bruges trips and bong hits the semester was a fantasy PERIOD

Yes metaphysically it happened but the experience is impossible to explain or relate to PERIOD Ask a Castle kid were easy to find we cant go more than three minutes without mentioning how amazing the Castle is how the semester was and we cant explain it PERIOD It was so dreamlike so different from a conventional college semester you cant know what its like unless youre there PERIOD

A year hence dozens of my Castle friendsdozens of my best friendsare planning to enter the Los Angeles program PERIOD But not me PERIOD

What the hell guys How will I have fun What about our parties Who will tell me what movies to see Who will lend me their Netflix to watch them

Looking at the program though I see it will be no frivilous West Coast jaunt PERIOD I wish them Godspeed PERIOD

When youre in L.A. you dont merely play castle you enter the rat race for a semester PERIOD Shortly thereafter you graduate PERIOD

Thats a whole lot scarier than windmills and tulips PERIOD
