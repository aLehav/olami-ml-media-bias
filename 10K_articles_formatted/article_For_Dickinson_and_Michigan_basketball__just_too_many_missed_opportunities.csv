SAN ANTONIO  All things considered it was a quiet night for Hunter Dickinson PERIOD

The sophomore center didnt really make any shots to send Michigan fans into a frenzy and transform him into a maize and blue showman PERIOD

Dickinson still talked of course  he always does  but he just didnt quite have it on Thursday night PERIOD No one on Michigan really did PERIOD Thats why Michigans season ended in the Sweet Sixteen PERIOD Thats why he wasnt his normal talkative self at the podium after the game PERIOD And thats why when Dickinson was asked about whether or not he felt that he and the rest of the team left a lot of points on the floor due to poor layup making he didnt say much PERIOD

Yeah I think it just wasnt our night out there. is there really much else to say The Wolverines shots just didnt fall and Villanovas  at least more so  did PERIOD Dickinson knows that firsthand PERIOD Ten of his  shots missed the most on the team PERIOD Most werent even jumpers a lot of them were actually right at the rim the spot he usually dominates PERIOD

Just not tonight PERIOD

The Wildcats knew Dickinson was coming their coach Jay Wright gameplanned for him and had nothing but positive things to say about him after the game PERIOD

We didnt run into anybody anywhere like Hunter Dickinson Wright said PERIOD Man this dude is a handful I think hes the best weve run into this year. on film Wright saw what everyone in the Big Ten saw all year and probably shuddered PERIOD A sevenfooter with elite postmoves a deep understanding of the game and the smooth touch of a guard PERIOD The type of player that could almost singlehandedly will Michigan to victory PERIOD Dickinson could be that good PERIOD

Just not tonight PERIOD

Its an especially surprising circumstance given that Dickinson was supposed to dominate this game PERIOD He stands five inches taller than the tallest member of Villanovas starting lineup PERIOD

To counter this Wright mentioned that a large part of his gameplan was to get the Wolverines off their rhythm especially in the post with Dickinson PERIOD The Wildcats spent most of the game fronting him and trying to deny him the ball PERIOD The plan succeeded in making it difficult for Michigan to find its star big man in an advantageous position PERIOD

In short Villanova did throw Dickinson out of his rhythm PERIOD Maybe thats why the shots that are normally so easy for him just didnt fall PERIOD

As Michigan coach Juwan Howard sat at the podium face stoic he also tried to find the reason his team struggled so much where it usually didnt PERIOD But just like everyone he too couldnt quite place it PERIOD

Yes some of the spots that he was pushed off the block Howard said PERIOD But overall we got some good looks at the basket PERIOD Unfortunately it just didnt go our way. as Howard spoke Dickinson sat to his right PERIOD He held his head high but looked beyond into the room occasionally moving his head up and down as if to nod in agreement PERIOD But for the most part his eyes stared straight ahead PERIOD

His season was over and if hes still insistent on trying to make it to the NBA this offseason so too is his time with the Wolverines PERIOD

When asked to Dickinson tried to sum up his feelings toward the season never an easy thing to do when the emotions are so fresh but he still tried PERIOD He talked about the preseason expectations the fall from that pedestal how the team couldve easily given up after their rocky start PERIOD But then he pivoted PERIOD

We fought as hard as we could and to be able to make the Sweet Sixteen and be one of the last Sixteen teams standing Dickinson said PERIOD We obviously didnt reach our ultimate goal but Im just proud of how we fought back and battled through adversity. the fact that Michigan was even in this position after all that had happened in the season is still something of note PERIOD Especially when in order to get here Dickinson helped lead the Wolverines to two of their best wins of the season PERIOD A strong performance in a comeback win against Colorado State and a truly dominant showing in an upset victory over Tennessee PERIOD

Two of Dickinsons best showings of the season came in backtoback games when his team needed him the most PERIOD

Dickinson had made a habit of dominating the biggest stages of performing when he was required to no matter what was thrown at him PERIOD He had done it so many times before and he had shown that he was capable of leading Michigan to victory PERIOD

Just not tonight PERIOD
