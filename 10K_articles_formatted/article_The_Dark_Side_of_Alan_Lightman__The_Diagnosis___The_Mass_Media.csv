Lightmans lecture sponsored by the UMB English Department took place on December  where he answered questions students put forth by students on the meaning behind his books and questions about the creative process itself PERIOD

What Lightman brings to the literary table is different from most authors who seek to entertain PERIOD Mainly he wants to leave the reader thinking PERIOD A good novel is one that does not have answers. he went on to describe essays as being the best vehicle for getting a view across if that was the writers intention PERIOD Lightmans background in the sciences grouped with his creative capabilities has brought a certain aesthetic quality and attention to detail where he has more emphasis on structure than most PERIOD

A good novel is one where Im haunted PERIOD Im left in that state PERIOD I keep going back to that novel PERIOD I aspire more to the second than the first. in  Lightman started writing poetry for small literary magazines PERIOD The year  saw him make his way into publishing essays on the human side of science PERIOD From there he went on to publish short stories and reviews in magazines like The Atlantic Monthly Smithsonian Magazine Harpers Magazine The New York Times and Boston Review PERIOD His novel The Diagnosis was a finalist for the  National Book Award in fiction PERIOD

He went on to expound on the nature of contemporary literature citing that most of it was meant to entertain neither a bad or good thing but adequate in fulfilling that particular purpose PERIOD

Lightman writes every day and calls it a very solitary life. each summer he retreats to an island in Maine to unwind and unplug as he refers to it PERIOD Immersed as he is in some very technical aspects of his discipline even he feels the need to get away from it all PERIOD Lightman escapes in the rush in another way by avoiding the use of a cellular phones and email PERIOD

His latest work The Diagnosis according to Lightmans website features Bill Chalmers a junior executive in Boston who realizes that he cannot remember where he is going or even who he is PERIOD All he remembers is the motto of his company  the maximum information in the minimum time. lightmans work is best described as having a technology obsession with a social focus and asks the question Does faster better and more exact technology increase social progress
