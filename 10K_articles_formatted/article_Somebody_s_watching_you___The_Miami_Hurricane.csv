Remember last years slaying of the University of Miamis beloved campus crocodile

A police camera mounted on the Flipse building captured the license plate number of the getaway car which eventually led to an arrest PERIOD

Earlier this semester another police camera near the Ring Theater spotted two men trying to hotwire a motorcycle PERIOD

Though the suspects got away their pictures were quickly sent to officers around campus PERIOD This helped clear a student who police had stopped at gunpoint because he was wearing clothing similar to the suspects PERIOD

The University of Miami Police Department is currently monitoring more than  closedcircuit cameras across campus PERIOD The cameras have helped solve  crimes in the past six months said Chief of Police David Rivero PERIOD

Its amazing how many cases they help us with Rivero said PERIOD

With only  officers to patrol the 230acre campus the cameras serve as a force multiplier. they enable officers to patrol two or more areas at one time PERIOD

Rivero explained how an officer can sit in the Mahoney Pearson parking lot patrolling the region while simultaneously monitoring the parking lot outside Alex Rodriguez Field on his or her lap top where the feed from the camera streams on a server PERIOD

Junior India Stanton was surprised to find that UM has so many cameras on campus PERIOD

I dont even see them Stanton said PERIOD Im fine with them as long as theyre not in my room PERIOD If there was a situation where a crime happened Id rather them have surveillance. the current camera system has not always been so extensive or effective PERIOD

When I started three years ago I realized we were having crimes with cameras all around but we werent capturing anything Rivero said  PERIOD The system was dysfunctional. a year and a half ago Rivero began the process of revamping the camera system by analyzing a crime map and installing new cameras in highrisk areas as well as replacing old cameras with highdefinition cameras PERIOD

An additional objective of the overhaul was to integrate all cameras on campus as most academic buildings at the time operated their own private camera systems PERIOD Now all new buildings must have their cameras approved by UMPD PERIOD

It was a costly project said Rivero of the twomilliondollar overall price PERIOD

However he believes the system was worth every penny PERIOD

Ours is better than the Heats said Rivero of the American Airlines Arenas camera system in downtown Miami PERIOD

Rivero believes that the On SSI software is the element that sets UM apart PERIOD

We bought the best PERIOD Were the leading edge he said PERIOD

The software enables an officer to set parameters for the camera lens PERIOD If any movement is detected within those parameters the police are notified PERIOD

Chief Rivero has selected the newest and greatest in video systems for the Gables campus PERIOD Absolutely amazing stuff and very functional said Tony Artip the executive director of public safety at UMs Miller School of Medicine PERIOD

Rivero modeled his camera revamp after the med schools advanced 500camera system PERIOD

Actively monitoring more than  cameras proves impractical for most officers who must patrol campus respond to dispatch calls track equipment and file reports PERIOD

The cameras are primarily used as a means of catching criminals after they commit the crime PERIOD Rivero however wants to change that PERIOD

Hes planning a  UMPD station expansion that he hopes will be underway within the year PERIOD With the additional space he intends on installing a control room of camera monitors PERIOD

It would be like in the casinos he said PERIOD

Rivero would pay students  an hour to watch the cameras in an effort to spot suspicious activity and alert officers before crimes happen PERIOD

I want to catch them in the act Rivero said PERIOD Id rather not have any crimes than catch a bad guy PERIOD Were all about preventing them criminals from coming here. the cameras have already caught numerous perpetrators PERIOD

For instance Rivero explained that when a laptop was reported stolen in the law school courtyard the cameras revealed a worker placing trash from the tables as well as a lap top into the trash can she was pushing PERIOD

A lot of them are very well hidden such as the one in the Wellness Center Rivero said PERIOD

Approximately  percent of the cameras are visible and  percent are hidden PERIOD

The thought of being taped without ones knowledge is often disconcerting to those who value their privacy PERIOD

Thats the negative everyone thinks Big Brothers watching he said We watch areas that are public not bathrooms not dorms areas where you yourself could take out a camera. we want to record hot spots where there are a lot of people PERIOD It wouldnt pay off for me to put cameras where things arent happening he continued to say PERIOD

In this world of technology Rivero estimates the average person is photographed or taped at least six times a day be it walking into Publix or driving through a toll booth PERIOD

UM senior Chris Noel feels the use of cameras is an invasion of privacy PERIOD

I think our generation needs to be very wary about losing too much in terms of privacy in the name of advancements in modern technology Noel said  PERIOD

Artrip the director of security at the med school campus said cameras offer many benefits PERIOD

To the criminals I say big brother is watching Artrip said  PERIOD To the good students staff and visitors I say UM police are watching video in an attempt to detect and deter crime before it happens PERIOD

My daughter attends the school and Im thrilled that the university uses video surveillance to help protect her Artrip said PERIOD

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD",Somebodyâ€™s watching you - The Miami Hurricane,University of Miami
