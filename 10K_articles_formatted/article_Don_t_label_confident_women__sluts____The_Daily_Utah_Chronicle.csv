Im not sure why Andrew Kirk decided to label some young women as sluts in his recent column I prefer mummies to Charlies Angels Oct PERIOD  PERIOD It certainly didnt seem to fit his argument PERIOD Usually if someone wishes to go wild in anonymity he or she goes to Vegas not to a party full of classmates and friends PERIOD 
Unless these young women were going around propositioning man after man I fail to see how they would be at all deserving of this slanderous label PERIOD If their only crime was wearing some underwear as a costume where is the condescension and derision for the young men wearing only some shorts and going shirtless Or does Kirk belittle only women 
Since Kirk didnt bother to talk to any of those he labeled I am going to take the same liberty and make some conjectures without speaking to Kirk or his friends PERIOD It seems to me that he and his friends felt intimidated and threatened by these young women who had the audacity to be confident in both themselves and their sexuality PERIOD 
Some people Kirk arent ashamed of their bodies PERIOD Also from the article it seems that these young men were becoming frustrated in their attempts to ignore the beauty around them and this probably boiled over in anger and spite PERIOD Its sad to think of this group standing around thinking mean and petty thoughts about people they didnt know instead of actually enjoying a party PERIOD
