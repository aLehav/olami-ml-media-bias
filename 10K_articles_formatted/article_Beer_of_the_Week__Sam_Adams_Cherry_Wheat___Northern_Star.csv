By  DAN STONENovember  

Grade A

A guilty pleasure doesnt have to be a bad thing PERIOD

In the fruitflavored beer category Sam Adams Cherry Wheat stands out above the rest of the crop PERIOD

The majority of fruitflavored beers feature an overpowering fruit taste that creates a scenario in which the drinker can forget that they are drinking a beer PERIOD

However Cherry Wheat possess a sweet cherry taste that complements the bitter elements of the beer as opposed to overpowering the beer PERIOD

Cherry Wheat debuted in summer  as a seasonal offering and was so popular the brewery continued production yearround according to the Sam Adams Web site PERIOD

Whenever a seasonal beer is so well received by the consumer it becomes a yearround brew it is a safebet that the beer found a niche audience PERIOD

Though Cherry Wheat has a . percent alcohol content the smooth cherry taste masks the alcohol flavor PERIOD The body has a medium feel to it and actually tastes similar to a lighter beer instead of a darker beer PERIOD

I recommend Cherry Wheat to anyone who likes cherries and beer PERIOD Sam Adams pays extra attention to the cherry taste in Cherry Wheat so anyone who likes a mediumbodied beer and the taste of cherries should give this brew a chance PERIOD

Cherries are added at two different points during the brewing process according to the Sam Adams web site PERIOD Once during the mash and again during finishing. the aftertaste is an excellent example of how a fruitflavored beer should end PERIOD

The wellbalanced cherry taste to the brew echoes in the aftertaste which leaves a hint of cherry flavor for a few seconds PERIOD The aftertaste gives a similar effect as Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager only with cherry instead of chocolate PERIOD

Though Cherry Wheat produces a fairly thick foam when poured into a glass you really arent missing out on much if you drink it from the bottle PERIOD

If you enjoy Leinenkugels Honeyweiss or Berryweiss but are looking for a flavored beer that tastes more like beer go try Cherry Wheat now PERIOD

Also avoid Cherry Wheat if you have some terrible childhood truama related to cherry flavored coughsyrup because you might have a flashback PERIOD

If you dont like flavored beers Cherry Wheat probably wont change you into a believer but Id still recommend the brew with a meal PERIOD
