Elizabeth Greason  Thursday March  

Although  will only be Saint Marys third year with a varsity lacrosse program the team has improved over its short history PERIOD In the the Belles second season they more than doubled their win total from their first and finished last season with a  record PERIOD According to Belles head coach Amy Long the team is looking to make similar progress this season PERIOD

Our team did make a huge amount of progress during our second year and I expect an even larger amount of growth this season Long said PERIOD

One of the characteristics of this years team is its youth PERIOD After only losing a few seniors the team will be captained led by three juniors Katlynn Dee Emilie Vanneste and Shannon Weyer PERIOD The Belles also return six of their seven leading scorers from last year PERIOD On top of retaining the majority of the team the Belles have added six new members to the roster PERIOD As a result Long says that teambuilding has been a major focal point of preseason training PERIOD

Throughout our preseason we have focused on working together and the development of our offensive unit and our defensive unit Long said PERIOD With six new players and four players who were abroad during our fall season we have placed an emphasis on building relationships and communication to ensure we are working together as a team effectively PERIOD We have also been paying special attention to the small details of many of our basic lacrosse skills to create consistency as these little things will be the difference maker in many of our games. while other teams and coaches might consider fielding such a young team to be a risk Long expects the team to maintain a high caliber of play PERIOD

Emilie Vanneste and Katlynn Dee were our programs first AllMIAA selections and I have even higher expectations for them this season Long said PERIOD Vanneste along with sophomore Clare Theisen will lead our offense and midfield PERIOD Dee will continue to have an important role as a main leader for our defense and our two goalies Shannon Weyer and freshman Cara Givens who will also serve as vocal leaders. the Belles are looking to expand upon their reputation for strong defense this season PERIOD Last season Weyer had  saves as goalkeeper last season and the Belles totaled  caused turnovers PERIOD

On top of sustaining its strong defense the Saint Marys lacrosse team has optimistic hopes for the season as a whole PERIOD As Long outlined the team hopes to both start and finish the season in a strong manner PERIOD

Our team goals include coming back from our spring break training trip to Hilton Head with at least one win and qualifying for our conference tournament this season Long said PERIOD More than qualifying for the MIAA tournament which is accomplished through a topfour finish our goal is to win at least six of our eight conference games to earn a home game in the tournament. the Belles will embark on their season during their spring break trip from March  to March  when they will travel to Hilton Head South Carolina to take on Shenandoah Elms and Bryn Mawr PERIOD
