Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Its hard not to ignore the allure of the Pirate Rants section of the newspaper PERIOD The morbid curiosity that grabs us when we read about peoples dramatic personal lives and dark confessions is undeniable PERIOD From cheating significant others to admissions of pretty bizarre behavior we all feel entertained by the curious way our fellow students act and even hope that some of the more positive rants are about us PERIOD

Yet theres one facet of the Pirate Rants that in my opinion reflects more poorly on the students than any admission of overpartying or drunkenness could ever do body snarking PERIOD

Whats body snarking Well in short its comments that only focus on a persons body and not on anything that person can actually control PERIOD For example making fun of someones height natural hair color skin color or body type PERIOD These usually take the form of teasing redheads insulting men and women who are naturally larger than others or making fun of people for being too short or too tall to wear certain clothing PERIOD

One rant especially that ran about a year ago was targeted at a girl working out in the gym for having what the author called  I think it would be obvious that anyone in the gym is attempting to improve his or her body PERIOD It seems that the author wasnt happy with having to share the gym with someone not as naturally as skinny as them  and instead focused maybe even obsessed over the persons body to the point of feeling it was necessary to submit an anonymous rant about it PERIOD

This behavior strikes me as absolutely deplorable and even a little bit insane PERIOD What does it do to improve your own looks to snark on another persons body Especially on things they cant even control Does it really make you feel better to insult another person for their looks and if so what does that say about you that you feel you have to put down others in order to accept your own body

Of course I realize that many people only snark on others looks in order to feel better about themselves and the anonymity allowed in Pirate Rants often allows those who would normally only allow for a passing thought on anothers looks to take a fullfledged attack on that person in the name of entertainment PERIOD

I suppose theres nothing I can say here that can really take care of body snarking PERIOD Anyone who enjoys tearing others down for their looks isnt going to take a longwinded opinion piece to heart and change their ways PERIOD On that note anybody that agrees with me is probably not the type of person Im really trying to convince anyway PERIOD

All I really ask is next time youre about to submit that rant about someone based off of how disgusted you were with their hair their body or whatever think about how youd feel if you opened up the paper and read someone describing you in detail and how disgusted they were with you PERIOD

Would it still be harmless entertainment or would it finally cross the line into abuse
