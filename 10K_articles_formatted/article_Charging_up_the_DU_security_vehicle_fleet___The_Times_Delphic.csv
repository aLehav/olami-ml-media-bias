Students have been seeing security personnel driving around in Dodge Chargers PERIOD Ongoing tuition hikes are leaving students wondering exactly where our money is going PERIOD

Drake security is in charge of keeping the campus safe  that includes everything from returning lost wallets to locking the buildings at night and to patrolling the surrounding neighborhoods PERIOD They even had an incident back in February that required supervisor Mark Risvold to chase a pig through a parking lot near campus PERIOD

The security guards are here for the students and can be quickly and easily reached at any time of the day by calling the emergency number from any of the blue light posts around campus PERIOD They are always present cruising around in their little carts as the buildings of Drake lock up for the night PERIOD

The TimesDelphic stopped in the security office to talk with an officer right as the power went out throughout the city on Tuesday PERIOD In between checking the monitors and answering several phones ringing off the hook officer Dustin Runge sat down to explain the new vehicles around campus PERIOD

Drake security only drives three cars and the rest are sidewalk carts PERIOD These cars are given to the higherup administrators like the chief assistant chief and supervisor PERIOD

Runge has heard several times how surprising it is that the fleet is so small and he shrugs it off with a laugh pointing out that its more advantageous to have people think the security force is bigger than it actually is PERIOD The vehicles used to be  Dodge Durangos but those were traded in for a  Ford Escape a  Ford Escape and a  Dodge Charger PERIOD The cars are replaced every two years PERIOD Some fiscallyminded students question why the cars need to be replaced so frequently PERIOD Runge counters that the cars each total about  miles every year so they have to be swapped out on a regular basis to avoid losing money through repair costs PERIOD

Its important to note that after security is done with the vehicles like the old Durangos they are repurposed for the maintenance department PERIOD The new cars for the security department are always bought used and they are always the baseline models with few to no additional features PERIOD Because of all of the surveillance technology and equipment that has to fit inside each car on the force ordinary civilian vehicles cannot be used PERIOD The officers have limited options for cars that can be adapted to security duties and can deal with infamous Iowa winters PERIOD

Other than the carts seen around campus there are only three vehicles used by the security force PERIOD The money for the vehicles does not come out of student tuition PERIOD Runge said that there is a separate fund set aside by the university for security purposes and it comes out of that budget PERIOD



Our department has a very minimal budget PERIOD We do everything in our power to keep expenses down PERIOD For the past six years we have rotated the Chevy Impala and Durango PERIOD It was decided this year to change from Impala to Charger PERIOD The Impalas dont hold up well PERIOD The vehicles are ran  hours a day  days a year PERIOD We use mobile patrol as a deterant to keep unwanted guests off campus and respond to thousands of serviceemergency calls every school year PERIOD It is a much needed tool for our daily functions PERIOD

Dodge Chargers are designed for law enforcement and public safety applications PERIOD Our vehicles contain radios dash cameras emergency lighting and public address systems PERIOD The equipment requires a center console only compatible with standard law enforcement vehicles such as the Charger Crown Victoria and Impala PERIOD With our experience using Chevy Impalas and Ford stopping the manufacturing of Crown Victoria we decided to go with the Charger PERIOD We also made a decision to have our equipment installed in house instead of using outside contractors PERIOD This move was also made to reduce vehicle expenses PERIOD
