Yamhill Valley wines PERIOD

Jenny Burger graduated in  from the UW with a degree in biology specializing in evolution ecology and conservation PERIOD Since then she has put her degree to good use serving as general manager of Yamhill Valley Vineyards Winery in the foothills of the Oregon Coast Range PERIOD

Biology explains so much to me and I think it can translate easily outside of science PERIOD Lots of vineyard management fermentation and winemaking is sciencebased so my biology degree comes into play frequently PERIOD My understanding plant biology the ecology in the vineyard climate science fermentation science lab analysis of wines is all thanks to biology Burger said PERIOD

Her sciencebased background encourages her to ask the necessary question of why in order to critically understand the processes of the winery whether it be communicating to the buyer accounting or understanding the science of the wine itself PERIOD

All of this is important in business particularly in my position as I am taking over a business with  years of history Burger said PERIOD

The vineyard open yearround offers wine tastings charcuterie vineyard views tasting rooms and a full deck PERIOD The winery is dedicated to Pinot Noir Pinot Gris Pinot Blanc Chardonnay Ros and Riesling PERIOD

The winery advertises their commitment and passion for quality product PERIOD They provide their mission statement on their website From our beginning we have been stubbornly dedicated to the pursuit of a character that is distinctively Oregon and distinctively Yamhill Valley PERIOD Our goal is to bring forth from this unusual and exciting property the finest possible expression of its intensity charm and uniqueness. established in  by Burgers parents Denis Burger and Elaine McCall alongside family friend David Hinrichs the vineyard began after the family stumbled across a classified listing for a plot of land advertised as Land for Sale  Good Grapes. as they pulled up to the property the rain stopped and rainbow appeared and they fell in love Burger said PERIOD

The 40acre property located in McMinnville was about  times the size they were looking for but the price was right and the family jumped on the opportunity PERIOD

At the time there were few wineries in Oregon making Yamhill Valley Vineyards the fifteenth PERIOD

In  the OregonBurgundy Challenge was held in New York it was a blind taste test of  vintages Oregon Pinot Noirs and Burgundy Pinot Noirs PERIOD The Oregon wines placed first second third and tied for fourth and fifth with Yamhill Valley Vineyards  Pinot Noir taking first place PERIOD This signaled to my parents that they had made the right choice purchasing that property Burger said PERIOD

Today the vineyard produces roughy  cases of wine is home to a yearround tasting room and distributes to two states including WA PERIOD

As the vineyard transitions to secondgeneration ownership Burger has begun to take the business over from her father PERIOD However the industry faces challenges of its own PERIOD There are lots of challenges in this industry but you have to be able to see them as opportunities Burger said PERIOD

What started as a handful of Oregon wineries has grown to hundreds all producing high quality wine creating high quality competition PERIOD

Despite the challenge Burger remains optimistic PERIOD You have to be proud of how far weve come Burger said PERIOD Our industry has a reputation for being collaborative and helping each other succeed is how we made Oregon wine as whole gain the respect and value that is has today. while many wineries can appear pretentious Yamhill aims to remain accessible sharing the hard work that goes into making wine PERIOD

There are a lot of things that are still done by hand and by pure muscle power PERIOD When you are drinking a fine wine in a nice glass its sometimes hard to imagine the  hour days doing  punchdowns and processing  Ts of fruit PERIOD Plus there are yellow jackets everywhere Burger said PERIOD

Burger hopes for wine to be approachable and fun and invites others if theyre  to give it a try as well PERIOD

We are a nonpretentious winery PERIOD We try to make people feel comfortable no matter what their level of knowledge of wine is beginners to novices. reach Social Media Editor Sarah Archer at artsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter saraharcher99
