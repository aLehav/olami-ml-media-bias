Kelly Clarkson All I Ever Wanted  March 
 So everyone goes through a tough breakup that shakes their life PERIOD Kelly Clarkson experiences something like that hence her last fulllength release My December PERIOD Hardly anyone splurged for the followup Breakaway which was a shame  As far as breakup albums it had some good material PERIOD But now shes back to the bubbly Clarkson we love with an infectious single My Life Would Suck Without You and critics are raving about the upcoming album All I Ever Wanted PERIOD Look for more chick rock and fist pumping anthems about female independence that secure men can dance to as well PERIOD

Watchmen March 
 Zack Snyder made a little movie two years ago called . every man in the room please cheer because that was a manmovie. now Snyder is back adapting what has long been called the unfilmable comic book Watchmen PERIOD But its so much more than a comic or graphic novel its a work of art PERIOD TIME Magazine called it one of the  Best English novels  and many other news organizations have lavished praise upon it PERIOD The film presents realistic superheros living in a dystopian alternate past struggling with their lives and an unseen force that is assaulting them PERIOD Admit it  Youve seen the trailer and you want to see this movie PERIOD You and every other fanboy in America PERIOD

U2 No Line on the Horizon  March 
 The first single Get on Your Boots sucked PERIOD Im a little nervous but then its U2 often called the greatest rock band in the world PERIOD Though Coldplay might be making a play for that title. ill give the Irish crooners a little slack and buy this album PERIOD Critics have been yawning at No Line on the Horizon mostly and word of mouth is negative but Rolling Stone magazine gave it a rare fivestar review in their latest issue so surely something is good about it PERIOD Horizon is the first U2 album since November  and theyve generally got something for everyone PERIOD So despite the early tracks and the naysayers this should be worth a look PERIOD

The final Battlestar Galactica episodes  Every Friday through March 
 Viewers are halfway through the final season of Battlestar Galactica and its amazing PERIOD But even more amazing is looking ahead to the series finale which airs Friday March  at  p.m PERIOD Everyone is on the Lost bandwagon a show that has many similar characteristics to BSG. but while Lost keeps throwing the mysteries at the audience its refreshing to see a show on its last leg finally solving mysteries that have been bugging us for five years PERIOD And the reveals thus far have been completely worth it  giving hope to how Lost might go out when it ends next May PERIOD
