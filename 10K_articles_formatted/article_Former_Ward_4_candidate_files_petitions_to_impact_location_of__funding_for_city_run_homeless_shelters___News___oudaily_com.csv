The Norman warming shelter on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Former Ward  Norman City Council candidate Teresa Borum filed two petitions on Feb PERIOD  that if successful would impact the way Norman leaders make location and funding decisions for cityrun shelters PERIOD

One a petition for council members to consider pushes for the banning of city shelters from being placed within a halfmile from schools daycares and parks before the next city election PERIOD The other an initiative petition cosigned by Unite Norman cofounder Sassan Moghadam and Stephen Teel calls for a requirement that all proposed tax dollar expenditures on homeless shelters be put to a public vote PERIOD

City of Norman Chief Communications Officer Tiffany Vrska wrote in an email that the initiative petition could impact the citys ability to use community development block grant funds CARES Act funds American Rescue Plan Act funds or general fund tax dollars on a shelter by requiring voters to approve expenditures PERIOD The other petition could limit options for placing a resource for homeless residents PERIOD

City leaders must balance the needs of Normans homeless residents with those of other community members Borum said PERIOD Homelessness is not an issue concentrated in only Ward  and the area  which is quite compact already has several resources for residents without homes she added PERIOD

April Doshier the Food and Shelter executive director said the Ward  city council election made clear that the majority of the wards voters didnt support Borums campaign pledges related to homelessness PERIOD While she said she understands concerns about homelessness resources being concentrated in Ward  spreading them across town will make them more difficult to access PERIOD

Borum said city leaders are focused on building lowbarrier overnight shelters in the ward which concerns her because of the types of people the resources might attract PERIOD Borum said in a meeting with her and Ward  Councilmember Lee Hall former Norman Homeless Program Coordinator Michelle Evans explained lowbarrier shelters have a dont ask dont tell policy meaning sex offenders and people with histories of violence are allowed to stay there PERIOD Norman currently has two overnight shelters according to the McFarlin Memorial United Methodist Church Resource List PERIOD

While state laws exist banning sex offenders from residing within a 2000footradius from educational institutions playgrounds or parks Borum said there arent any laws banning a homeless shelter from being placed next to these areas pushing her to file an initiative petition PERIOD Ward  has more schools than any other ward so she said its important for it to have a safe environment that helps prevent kids from becoming homeless in the future PERIOD

Borum said shes also concerned about the potential for drug dealers to go to the ward to sell to people without homes PERIOD Dimensions a school that provides an alternative education program is in the area and Borum said she worries about those students being around drugs PERIOD

I dont compromise when it comes to the safety of children Borum said PERIOD I dont believe anybody should compromise with the safety of children. borum said city leaders must also consider the effects of future shelter placements beyond potentially endangering students PERIOD The downtown area has preexisting issues with homeless people sleeping in doorways which might be exacerbated by a new shelter there Borum said PERIOD Homeless people taking up space on sidewalks and begging passersby for money can deter people from spending time downtown she said which can harm business and indirectly hurt homeless people as tax dollars help support homelessness resources PERIOD

The city council is also considering placing a homeless shelter next to the citys new senior center which could compromise the safety of older Norman residents who are often already vulnerable Borum said PERIOD She said many of the people visiting the senior center are living on a fixed income and some also have declining memories meaning they might not have the courage to say no to requests for money PERIOD

When Borum expressed her concerns to Hall she said Hall sympathized with her concerns but told her a new shelter was going to be placed in the ward regardless PERIOD Borum said she was shocked and reached out to many of her neighbors and learned theyd gotten similar responses from Hall PERIOD

Finding a solution will take work but there are many potential shelter locations that also protect other citizens Borum said PERIOD She also said shes concerned city leaders arent worried about representing their constituents concerns accurately which pushed her to file the petition calling for greater community input in shelter funding PERIOD

A bond issue that would have funded homelessness solutions was voted down by Norman residents in  and Borum said Hall told her the decision would be put to the city council instead of another public vote citing the fact that the bond issue almost passed PERIOD

Borum said this felt like city leaders were putting words in voters mouths PERIOD Voters need to be given all the information they need to make an informed vote Borum said adding that peoples opinions can be skewed by failing to provide a complete picture of an issue PERIOD

Lowbarrier cityrun homeless shelters are drastically different from nonprofits as they end up attracting people from out of town and costing more money Borum said PERIOD According to research published in May  organizations in  that only provided shelter received approximately  in revenue per bed for single adults and shelters that provided shelter and additional services like behavioral and mental health services and case management received  per bed PERIOD

She added that while nonprofits can individualize the care they provide cityrun shelters are more of a onesizefitsall solution PERIOD If the petition is approved by voters she said the city can still invite more nonprofits to provide services PERIOD

I believe in helping people but as a city how many do you help Borum said PERIOD We want to help those who are Normanites but can we help all of Oklahoma Citys homeless Can we help all of Tulsas homeless All of the state of Oklahomas homeless The countrys Where does it stop

Doshier said its quite likely that more nonprofits will move to Norman as City Manager Darrel Pyle said the city is a facilitator not a direct service provider for homelessness needs during a Feb PERIOD  study session PERIOD However she said if it becomes harder for cityrun shelters to be built individuals without homes will sleep in public areas putting more strain on neighborhoods PERIOD

Ultimately everybody agrees that seeing people sleep on the streets and in parks and all the trash they leave behind is a bad thing Doshier said PERIOD Everybody agrees on that PERIOD The solution is the same no matter how you feel PERIOD The solution is to give them a place to sleep at night PERIOD  So I think its coming from a place of ignorance and fear that is unnecessary. community response to the two petitions has generally been very positive Borum said PERIOD According to city law a petitioner has  days to collect at least  percent of the number of votes cast in the previous mayoral election PERIOD If they reach that amount the initiative triggers a citywide public vote PERIOD

Borum filed her initiative petition before the Feb PERIOD  election meaning shell have to garner at least  signatures according to the city website PERIOD So far she said she has around  signatures PERIOD Reaching the vote goal depends heavily on other community members getting involved as with a fulltime job Borum said the time she can spend knocking on doors is limited PERIOD

Its going to require a lot of people who are willing to donate time but I do know that there are a lot of people who are passionate about whats  on both of the petitions Borum said PERIOD Theres nothing radical this is just the safety of our children and let us vote PERIOD And theyre in full support of  both of them. senior news reporter
