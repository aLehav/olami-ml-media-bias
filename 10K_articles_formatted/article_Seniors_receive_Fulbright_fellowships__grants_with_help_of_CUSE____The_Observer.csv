Ciara Hopkinson  Friday May  

Fourteen members of the class of  will be heading off this fall to conduct research attend graduate school or teach English with the aid of national and international fellowships and grants PERIOD The majority of those students are Fulbright grant recipients PERIOD

Jeffrey Thibert director of the Center for Undergraduate Scholarly Engagement CUSE said Fulbright grants have become increasingly popular over the past few years with each years finalists fueling more applications PERIOD

I think whats happening is that as students receive some of these they then get publicized more and more which then leads more students to hear about them and apply for them which then leads to more success which then leads to more publicity Thibert said PERIOD We had a couple really good years with Fulbright and now weve seen that become a pretty consistent thing because people are hearing about them. fulbright awards take two forms the English Teaching Assistantship ETA and the StudyResearch Grant the Fulbright website said PERIOD Fulbright ETA finalists live in the country of their choice for one year and teach English at the elementary high school or university level while StudyResearch Grant finalists conduct research receive a masters degree or a combination of the two PERIOD Thibert said Notre Dames class of  has  students who have accepted Fulbright grants PERIOD

Everybody has a plan B set up and what typically happens is people will if they find out they receive the Fulbright they will then go back to whatever the plan B was and see if they can defer so people can defer graduate school admissions medical school admissions  often employers are willing to defer job starts for a year to do something like the Fulbright Thibert said PERIOD

Thibert said ETA applicants typically have some experience teaching English whether in the community or abroad and studyresearch applicants have usually conducted research abroad or at Notre Dame PERIOD The third category of applicants fall somewhere in the middle PERIOD

Maybe they were abroad for a semester maybe they just went abroad for a limited amount of time but they like the idea of having an immersive cultural experience for a year while teaching English or conducting some kind of project Thibert said PERIOD In some countries the English Teaching Assistantship doesnt require previous English teaching experience  but they do need you to be open to this immersive year abroad. senior Nadia Braun said she knew she was going to apply for the ETA grant by the time she reached her sophomore year PERIOD Braun whose mother taught Russian before she was born had been considering a Fulbright grant in Russia for years PERIOD

I talked to CUSE and asked what the process was like and then it sort of is the perfect marriage of my Russian major and education schooling and society minor Braun said PERIOD So I was like This is really what I want to do. cUSE was great they helped me with the entire application process and really directed me so it worked out. brauns backup plan was participating in Teach for America a nonprofit organization that provides the opportunity to teach in lowincome schools which she deferred for a year PERIOD Brauns interest in higher education and her previous experiences in Russia and English tutoring greatly strengthened her application Braun and Thibert said PERIOD She said she is excited to return to Russia where she studied abroad and also visited in high school PERIOD

Russias been a really big part of my life since I was small so Im really excited to go back and have the opportunity to travel more Braun said PERIOD Im excited to meet new people because youre so invested in the community youre going to be living in  youre working at a university youre not only teaching but a lot of the Fulbrighters end up teaching other English classes or running an English Club or volunteering and teaching elementary students so you really get to be a part of that world and Im really excited to do that. though she doesnt know what city shell be placed in Braun said she predicts it will be an area lacking a large amount of English speakers PERIOD While other Russianspeaking countries had plenty of opportunities for teaching English at the elementary and high school level Braun chose Russia because she is guaranteed to be teaching at a university reflecting her longterm goal to work in higher education PERIOD

Even in high school looking at different colleges and doing the whole college search thing was really fascinating to me Braun said PERIOD Then once I got to college I realized that a thing I could actually pursue as a career was being involved in that structure PERIOD When I started the education schooling and society minor I realized how much inequity there is in higher ed and so I really wanted to work to help people who dont necessarily have the same opportunities that Ive had to be able to succeed in the higher education system. senior Jeremy CappelloLee will be heading to South Korea to begin his two year masters degree program at Yonsei Universitys Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul South Korea through the Fulbright StudyResearch grant PERIOD His program focuses on global affairs with an emphasis on Korean studies CappelloLee said PERIOD

This particular program since its a graduate program offered a way to transition from my major being philosophy here to a more businessfocused and applied course of study he said PERIOD Ill be taking courses in economics management politics so its a way of transitioning into diplomacy international trade  those types of sectors afterwards. cappelloLee who is half Korean coupled his major in philosophy with Asian studies and said he believes the Asia region which is already receiving a lot of attention will only continue to grow more influential on the world stage PERIOD

My interest stemmed after high school when I took a sort of gap year in South Korea and I studied the language there and traveled and volunteered and stuff CappelloLee said PERIOD That kind of sparked my interest in the region and then I continued that thread at Notre Dame and combined it with a focus in China  so China Korea U.S PERIOD relations. cUSE was extremely helpful he said in creating a grant proposal that was relevant personal and convincing within two pages integrating both his past experiences and future goals PERIOD

CUSE is a great asset and I cant stress enough how helpful they have been in my application process PERIOD They really make a seemingly daunting process much more manageable CappelloLee said PERIOD

Like Braun CappelloLee said he was excited about returning to the cities he visited in the year before college PERIOD

Having had these four years of university I think Ive grown as a person and Im really excited to see how thats changed my perspective on Seoul CappelloLee said PERIOD

While many grants take students abroad for their studies a number of them also focus on continuing education in the United States PERIOD Senior Michael Foley was awarded the Gates Cambridge Scholarship to pursue a Ph.D PERIOD in astrophysics but ultimately declined the grant in favor of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship NSFGRF which funds students for three years of research in a STEM field PERIOD

The idea is just that you can ignore any other financial strains you may have and just be purely funded and not have to answer to a single advisor either Foley said PERIOD You have the freedom to kind of work with whoever you want and not be financially tied to a single person. foley said since the money comes from the government and does not have specific requirements he will have the freedom to study whatever he is most interested in without the pressure of an outside source of funding that expects a certain result PERIOD

Its a little hard to develop your scientific abilities if youre only doing what someone else is telling you to do Foley said PERIOD If you dont have the freedom to explore your own ideas its a little bit more restrictive PERIOD A lot of times mentors are really good about that but sometimes you may get a mentor that isnt so great so if you can say I have my own funding thats a really big thing and CUSE seems to really understand that. foley hopes to eventually become a professor and continue to conduct research after receiving his doctorate from Harvard but he said he could also transition his skills into a career in the technology sector PERIOD His experiences doing undergraduate research and his previous work with CUSE have opened him up to the possibilities in academia he said PERIOD

Ive always loved space and I didnt realize I could research it as a career until I got here Foley said PERIOD I came in expecting to study physics and computer science and just be interested in space but go and work at a tech company or something but I jumped into research my freshman year and I absolutely loved it  it showed me that there were actually opportunities to study something I love. foley also received the Goldwater Scholarship during his junior year and the application process and the award itself served as a step toward subsequent awards Thibert said PERIOD

Its sort of meant to recognize outstanding student researchers who are on track to becoming outstanding faculty researchers typically so I think that was a pretty big stepping stone for him to some of these other fellowships Thibert said PERIOD

The application to both the Gates Scholarship and NSFGRF were time consuming Foley said but necessary to his future success PERIOD

I think it ultimately made me a lot more clear in the things Id like to pursue in grad school not so much academically but how Id like to use the knowledge and the skills Im gaining to teach others to help other people figure out what they want to do Foley said PERIOD It was a very informative process. this learning Thibert said is one of the main focuses of CUSE PERIOD With hundreds of Notre Dame students and alumni applying for grants every year CUSE has to be prepared for the majority to be rejected PERIOD

I dont know if I would say its the biggest challenge but its the thing that I see as our number one task which is to ensure that whether or not a student receives a fellowship theyre applying for they get value from the application process Thibert said PERIOD Its of course worth trying to apply to the great opportunities but I think its really important that as advisors we make sure that they are really getting something of value from the process. while getting the word out about grants and fellowships continues to be CUSEs greatest challenge Thibert said he has seen the number of applicants and recipients grow year after year PERIOD He said an emerging global perspective was one of the greatest factors in this increase PERIOD

Every year I think I see students becoming more and more internationally engaged and I think the University has put a real priority on internationalization and I think that I really see that impact Thibert said PERIOD The students are more intune with what is going on around the world more and more students seem to be studying abroad and more and more students are interested in having these experiences that allow them to engage globally. thibert said he hopes to see even more students apply and dreads that students might regret missing an opportunity PERIOD Success builds on success he said which is evident in the everincreasing number of Fulbright applicants PERIOD

I hope students would see what some of these graduating seniors have been able to achieve during their time here and recognize that they too might be able to achieve some of these same things Thibert said PERIOD There is this sort of culture of fellowships developing here where I think people are talking about these things people do know about them PERIOD I would like to see that culture expand a little. share This Story
