Lake Marion Staff WriterMarch  

NORFOLK V.A. the Morgan State womens basketball team gave it their all in the MEAC tournament PERIOD

The No. university of Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks upset the No PERIOD  Morgan State Bears in the MEAC quarterfinal round of the tournament  in what was a close game PERIOD The two teams met twice earlier this season where they split the series  PERIOD

The Bears defeated the Hawks at their home court in their first meeting by  points at home court PERIOD In the second matchup the Hawks defeated the Bears by three points at their home court PERIOD

This time the two settled the score in their final matchup at Norfolk Scope Arena a neutral site and the Hawks pulled through in the end PERIOD The game was broadcasted on ESPN and the Bears and Hawks battled it out from start to finish PERIOD

The Hawks played aggressively the whole game they made sure that they forced the Bears to take contested shots and forced them to shoot threes down the stretch PERIOD

The Hawks head coach Fred Batchelor expressed how well his team played in another close game against the Bears PERIOD

I thought that our ability to be able to make some shots created a cushion for us said Batchelor PERIOD Then they made a run then the game was of the runs PERIOD We were fortunate that we were able to make the run at the end. the Hawks closed out the game on a  run after being down  at the end of the third quarter PERIOD The Hawks leading scorer was guard Zamara Haynes who finished the game with  points four rebounds and three assists PERIOD

After an explosive third quarter the Bears struggled to keep their momentum in the fourth shooting just  percent  from the field and  percent  from beyond the arc PERIOD The Bears slowed the game down once they got the lead back and it would later affect them in the long run PERIOD



Bears head coach Ed Davis Jr PERIOD said the team got a little hesitant when the game got tight PERIOD

Our biggest thing was trying to contain the guards said Davis PERIOD I thought we did a good job in the third quarter PERIOD Thats their strength PERIOD We just came up on the short end of it tonight. the Bears did their best to bounce back in the game PERIOD In the first half of the game the Bears were down by  points early in the second quarter PERIOD The Hawks had all the momentum and were getting steals and making the Bears commit turnovers that would result in points for them PERIOD

That is when the momentum shifted when the score was  midway through the second quarter PERIOD The Bears went on an  run to cut the deficit to three points before Hawks guard Zamara Haynes made a threepointer at the buzzer to end the half to give the Hawks a  lead PERIOD

Bears forward Charlene Shepherd spoke about the teams struggles with starting off early in their games PERIOD

Its been an ongoing thing for us Shepherd said PERIOD It was just us being a secondhalf team and doing what weve known how to do all year. shepherd is in her final year with the Bears PERIOD She finished the game as the Bears leading scorer ending with  points eight rebounds and three steals PERIOD She is one of four players on the team that is in their graduate years PERIOD

Davis was asked how he plans to reshape the teams foundation with some of the players leaving after this season PERIOD

I think we are doing a very good job at trying to recruit in areas said Davis PERIOD Our biggest thing next year is to make sure that we bring in players who are a little more sufficient in shooting on the perimeter PERIOD I think that will help us a whole lot next year. it might not be the way the Bears wanted to end the season but overall the team did have its accomplishments PERIOD They finished with a  record this season won  of their  conference games and went  at home PERIOD

The team showed a lot of tenacity and grit throughout the entire semester until the very end PERIOD Shepherd had final words for the younger players before closing out the day PERIOD

I would tell them to stay the course Shepherd said PERIOD Just trust the process trust what the coaches are telling us and really just leave it on the floor. this was something that was never given to us PERIOD We had to earn this. your donation will support the student journalists of Morgan State University and the work of The MSU Spokesman Marylands oldest HBCUbased newspaper PERIOD Your contribution while not taxdeductible will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
