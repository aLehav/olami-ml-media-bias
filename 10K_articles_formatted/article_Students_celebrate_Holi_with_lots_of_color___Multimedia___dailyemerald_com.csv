In past years up to  students have attended Holi at UO PERIOD

This year the weather was fairly cold and rainy PERIOD

Holi is celebrated yearly at the University of Oregon PERIOD Although Holi is usually celebrated in the Spring between February and March in India at UO the weather is too cold so it is celebrated in June PERIOD

The origin of Holi is based on a mythological story about the demoness Holika who was killed in a fire by the god Vishnu PERIOD The festival represented the celebration of good versus evil PERIOD Holi is celebrated all over the Indian subcontinent and all over the world by Hindu communities PERIOD

Now according to Rishika Krishna UO student and incoming president and director of SIS Holi has a romantic associationand it is a day to celebrate and be with family and friends PERIOD It has the Hindu mythological background but now its more associated with people getting together and having fun she said PERIOD

According to Krishna anyone is welcome to join even if they dont usually celebrate Hindu holidays or know much about the history behind the festival PERIOD

Its the one time of year that anybody from any family can come together and celebrate she said PERIOD

If you watch Bollywood Holi is always associated with a romantic fling coming to beKrishna said because its the one day where anything can happen. josh Ryerson and Hugo Pineda dumping an umbrella full of color onto their friends.Ben GreenDaily Emerald
