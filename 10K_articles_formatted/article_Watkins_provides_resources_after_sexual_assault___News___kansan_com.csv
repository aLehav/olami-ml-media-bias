Although the U.S PERIOD Department of Justice estimates that one in five women will be sexually assaulted during their time in college many students may not even know what resources are available for victims of sexual assault PERIOD

Roxie Dohogne a registered nurse at Watkins Memorial Health Center said she thinks there are students on campus who are unaware of the services offered at Watkins PERIOD

Dohogne said there is one nurse practitioner working at Watkins who is certified as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner SANE which means she is qualified to administer sexual assault evidence collection kits more commonly called rape kits. some universities around the country lack a nurse with this certification at their campus health centers such as the University of North Texas whose students have recently started a petition to provide the kits according to a USA Today College article on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

The cost to provide the certification remains an obstacle for schools like UNT but Dohogne said that the University would cover the cost of any nurse at Watkins seeking to obtain the certification PERIOD

Rape victims are able to utilize the health center for performing the rape kit and for any advice about what they can do next said Dohogne PERIOD

She added that since these appointments are typically timeconsuming Watkins tries to accommodate the victims as much as possible since theyve already been through a traumatic event PERIOD

We can get them taken care of here Dohogne said PERIOD

Though the services offered at Watkins are a convenient resource on campus for students the certified nurse practitioner is only available during business hours which are limited on weekends and there are days when she might not be working PERIOD Depending on when the sexual assault takes place students may not be able to use the resources available at Watkins PERIOD

Another option for students is to seek help from the GaDuGi SafeCenter which is open  and is located less than a tenminute drive from campus and is always available by phone PERIOD

GaDuGi offers a comprehensive range of options for support said Chrissy Heikkila interim executive director of the center including immediate actions like taking the victim to the hospital for an exam or helping them report the assault to the police or more longterm options such as guiding them through the investigation and offering them the option to talk with a therapist PERIOD

All the services at the center are at absolutely no cost to the victim and any actions taken following the assault are completely up to the victim said Heikkila PERIOD

We can be as big or as little as people need us to be PERIOD Whether its one phone call or years of support from us we are always here Heikkila said PERIOD We support them in whatever decision they choose. heikkila adds that the advocates at the center are there for the victims for as long as they need them even if they waited years to talk to someone about the assault for the first time PERIOD

Watkins and GaDuGi both offer students many resources in the event of being affected by sexual assault whether they were a victim personally or they are seeking advice for how to help someone close to them who is a victim PERIOD

If they need someone to talk them through the process of what to do and where to go we can always help them with that Dohogne said PERIOD
