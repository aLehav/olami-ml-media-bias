8953,2023-11-04,"mar Valdecantos Marlene Rojas and Lucy Gonzales are just three of the many Northfield residents who have worked toward implementing a Municipal ID initiative in Northfield PERIOD After many months of community organizing education and advocacy on Dec PERIOD  the Northfield City Council unanimously voted in favor of a Municipal ID city ordinance PERIOD

The latinx immigrant community in New Haven Conn PERIOD began the Municipal ID movement in  in an attempt to help undocummented residents access a valid form of photo identification PERIOD

This is something that many cities around the country have done in the past PERIOD People can get confused its not a driving license its not a document you can use to vote PERIOD It started with  immigrants acting out of frustration of not having driving licenses or state IDs Valdecantos said PERIOD She is currently the Vice Chair of the Northfield Human Rights Commission PERIOD

While the Municipal ID began as a tool to bolster the resource access and community involvement of immigrant communities it has proved useful for other groups as well PERIOD At minimum the cards include the cardholders photograph full name date of birth address signature issue date and expiration date PERIOD

Its a glorified library card in a way Valdecantos said PERIOD It has the information card and the picture PERIOD As you know in this country its hard to get picture ID if you dont drive PERIOD This would provide picture ID for those who cannot otherwise access it. the cards may also include information like pertinent medical histories the card holders chosen gender and official or unofficial names PERIOD The cards consequently allow gender nonconforming cardholders to identify their own gender and provide senior citizens who cannot drive a valid form of ID PERIOD

Valdecantos and other local community organizers began pursuing this possibility for Northfield over one year ago when Mariano Espinoza a communtiy organizer from the Twin Cities mentioned the Municipal ID during a Know Your Rights training held at Greenvale Community School PERIOD

This has been a very long process in that the very seed of it was way back during the last election cycle when we got the new mayor Valdecantos said PERIOD When she was elected I approached her and said Your predecessor tried to connect with the latino community in town so what are you going to do to do the same

In hopes of both passing and successfully implementing a Municipal ID ordinance Valdecantos and others researched the strategies of exemplar community advocates and cities who had already done so PERIOD

We started having conversations with the city in May Valdecantos said PERIOD The mayor asked that we proposed this from the Human Rights Commission PERIOD It just so happened that I am on the Commission PERIOD Then we had a presentation to the City back on Sept PERIOD  and after that the City had to do their own research based on what we offered them. there were three followup meetings scheduled on Nov PERIOD  Dec PERIOD  and Dec PERIOD  to consider the ID proposal PERIOD The ordinance was consequently drafted and considered in full at the Dec PERIOD  meeting PERIOD

It was absolutely packed Council Member Suzie Nakasian said PERIOD The community members stepped forward and gave so many examples PERIOD For instance when a person goes to pick up their child from daycare the daycare requires an ID that says you are in fact who you say you are PERIOD Many undocumented people dont have an ID  so they have to carry very precious documentation. during the meeting the City Council voted to implement a Municipal ID initiative in Northfield PERIOD Despite the unanimous vote it is not yet an official city ordinance as there must be a second deliberation meeting for it to be passed PERIOD This meeting will take place on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

Next Tuesday is mainly a formality Valdecantos said PERIOD The work is not done because the first cards may be issued in March of   and we still have to educate the community PERIOD The more people that sign up to get their IDs the better PERIOD It shouldnt be the senior card or the immigrant card or the transgender card. nakasian echoed Valdecantos emphasizing the importance of all community members obtaining a Municipal ID once they are available PERIOD While a drivers license accomplishes the practical benefits that the alternative ID offers certain residents Valdecantos and Nakasian asserted that the ordinance is about more than practicality PERIOD

It is a gesture that confirms that we are a community and that everyone who lives here are a valued part of that community PERIOD Period Nakasian said PERIOD Its at no additional expense to the city except for the cost of the cards PERIOD We really encourage all students everybody to have one in solidarity with them. moving forward communitywide engagement with the Municipal ID will be vital for its success on an individual and community level PERIOD

What weve got is support all across the board we have tons of letters of support from many different groups in town including at the state level as well PERIOD Legislators and so forth Valdecantos said PERIOD Undocumented people are overwhelmed at the support they see that they didnt know existed.",Northfield Municipal ID passes first round vote â€“ The Olaf Messenger,St. Olaf College
