2626,2023-11-04,"growing up as a child in the digital age I had minimal restraints on what I was allowed access to on the internet PERIOD Because of this I was drawn into true crime content like Criminal Minds and Cops from a young age PERIOD Exposure to this genre for the majority of my life has desensitized me to the perils of their realworld counterparts as reality blends in with everything Ive seen on TV PERIOD

In reality the unethical voyeuristic nature of true crime media exploits victims of heinous crimes PERIOD True crime medias popularity has glorified and romanticized violence desensitizing viewers and normalizing dangerous behavior PERIOD

The origin of true crime media dates back to informative crime pamphlets from to 16thcentury Britain PERIOD It has since evolved into various new forms over time with the emergence of the internet PERIOD As of  one in three Americans report consuming true crime content at least once a week mostly through TV shows and films PERIOD

In an interview with the New University UCI professor of criminology law and society Brandon Golob gave potential reasons for the true crime genres longevity PERIOD

What draws folks in is that a huge attraction to this genre is that its a counter to boredom It removes them from the boredom of daytoday life and were always seeking different activities to avoid it Golob said PERIOD

Golob emphasized how the old journalism aphorism if it bleeds it leads speaks towards the pursuit of media consumers to project themselves into a life that they would never live themselves PERIOD He claims that it stems from a deeprooted fascination with the sensationalization of crime as something sexy taboo forbidden and deviant PERIOD

An evolutionary psychology point of view suggests that its human nature to try to be aware of true crime events to protect ourselves and our loved ones PERIOD It also appeases our instinctive desire to know the distinctive behaviors of criminals PERIOD Although being vigilant is a good trait excessively consuming true crime for the sake of awareness is counterproductive to the original intent PERIOD

The casting of wellknown heartthrobs to play murderers results in consumers inappropriately redirecting their empathy and romantic and sexual desires toward the perpetrator of the crimes PERIOD This is exemplified by how viewers of Netflixs Dahmer  Monster The Jeffrey Dahmer Story reacted to actor Evan Peters who played the titular character PERIOD Many tweets call out content creators such as TikToker themanni who has posted content romanticizing Evan Peters playing the role PERIOD

Professional news outlets have fallen victim to this tendency too PERIOD Headlines such as Huffington Posts Zac Efron Will Use His Washboard Abs To Play Serial Killer Ted Bundy and Blasting News Zac Efron is quirkier than you may think contribute to the sexualization of true crime PERIOD

This unnerving obsession started before the internet PERIOD It is known as hybristophilia the sexual attraction or arousal to extreme criminal offenders PERIOD Ted Bundy was responsible for killing more than  women but he amassed a staunch fanbase known as the Bundyphiles who advocated for his innocence in spite of the strong evidence against him PERIOD Richard Ramirez and Charles Manson both infamous serial killers and rapists found their eventual wives while imprisoned PERIOD

Access to the internet not only enables hybristophilia to spread through different forms over time but also promotes trauma voyeurism PERIOD

Trauma voyeurism is a contentposting tactic that capitalizes on a victims vulnerability and pain for the sole purpose of virality with no regard for potential lasting repercussions on the victim PERIOD It has become increasingly prevalent in the digital age as the means to post harmful content is more accessible than ever PERIOD

True crime medias relentless coverage of horrific crimes sustains this exploitative phenomenon PERIOD Survivors of these crimes and their loved ones are forced to continuously relive the worst moments of their lives for the entertainment and monetary gain of others PERIOD

Many streaming platforms ignore the vehement protests of friends and families in producing content based on the tragedies of their loved ones PERIOD The family of 25yearold Robert Mast who was murdered in  are victims of the greedy nature of these companies  more specifically Netflix PERIOD

Mindy Pendleton Masts stepmother begged the multibillion dollar corporation to not include her stepsons story in the series I Am a Killer. despite her and others pleas the series paints the woman who killed Mast in a sympathetic light further diminishing the severity of Masts death PERIOD

The Netflix series Dahmer  Monster The Jeffrey Dahmer Story received a lot of backlash for not including the families of Dahmers victims in the recording process PERIOD Ryan Murphy the shows creator recently published a statement attesting to the fact he reached out to  victims families but received no responses PERIOD

The lack of a reply from any of the families shouldve been an answer in and of itself PERIOD They did not consent to the show and they likely wanted no part in a system that thrives off the incessant exploitation of grief PERIOD

Theyre real humans real people that are in these storiestheir lives are being reduced to this Dr PERIOD Golob stated PERIOD

The constant exposure to true crime media desensitizes consumers PERIOD Or as Golob refers to it compassion fatigue. this is detrimental to being able to fully empathize with others and understand the weight of reallife occurrences and their repercussions PERIOD

A potential issue that we can argue from a moral human space is that so much overexposure to these topics in these cases creates compassion fatigue where folks arent actually feeling the human emotions attached Dr PERIOD Golob said PERIOD

The need for reform in the way we consume true crime is exceedingly evident PERIOD If our culture continues to glorify and exploit criminal events the cycle of unethical desensitization will persist PERIOD A future with a lack of regard for those affected by these atrocities is grim PERIOD

In order to amend this issue we must readjust the way we interact with true crime PERIOD While it is an entertaining genre to watch we should understand that with any podcast documentary or movie comes a certain agenda theyre attempting to get across PERIOD Its our responsibility as viewers to be able to discern between facts and potential narratives PERIOD

Every media artifact has value as long as were a critical consumer Golob said PERIOD

Its also important to separate the actor from their role PERIOD If attractive actors are going to continue to be cast in the roles of serial killers its vital to not romanticize them or their characters actions PERIOD It has become an all too familiar occurrence where serial killers actions are diminished due to the actors that play them PERIOD

Watching true crime isnt inherently bad as long as we prioritize being cognizant of its adverse effects PERIOD We must take mindful informed steps towards a less harmful future for true crime consumers and society at large PERIOD
