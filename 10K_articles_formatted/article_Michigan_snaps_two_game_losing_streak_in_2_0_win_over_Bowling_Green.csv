Cross PERIOD Shot PERIOD Rebound PERIOD Goal PERIOD

After  minutes Michigan finally ended its scoring drought when sophomore Raleigh Loughman ripped a shot into the upper corner  minutes into Sundays game PERIOD The play started when sophomore Meredith Haakenson received the ball from the corner took a touch turned and sent the ball towards the goal PERIOD The goalie dove and blocked the ball with an outstretched arm but it rebounded right into Loughmans path PERIOD A second later the ball found the back of the net PERIOD

The crowd and the Wolverine sideline erupted PERIOD

Loughmans goal propelled the Michigan womens soccer team  to a  victory over Bowling Green  on Sunday PERIOD

Just two minutes after Loughmans goal sophomore Skylar Anderson netted her first career goal on a header off a free kick from Loughman PERIOD Anderson disappeared into a sea of white as her teammates celebrated with her PERIOD

I cant even put words to it Anderson said PERIOD It was amazing PERIOD The whole team was there and it was just great PERIOD Theres no words. entering the game the Wolverines were fueled by something stronger than their need to snap a twogame losing streak  it was Senior Day and emotions were running high PERIOD

Despite the added motivation of Senior Day the Michigan offense struggled to capitalize on opportunities early on PERIOD Every time a player touched the ball she dribbled the ball down the field crossed it in and a teammate aimed to get a head or a foot on the ball PERIOD Rinse PERIOD Repeat PERIOD Chance after chance came and went but through  minutes the ball never found the net PERIOD

Opening the second half Michigan searched for a spark PERIOD Thirty seconds after the whistle freshman Lily Farkas took on a defender oneonone dribbled and rifled a shot off that sailed just over the crossbar PERIOD Minutes later sophomore Emma Cooper dinged a shot off the crossbar too PERIOD The Wolverines were a different team PERIOD

I told them to just keep moving the ball said Michigan coach Jennifer Klein PERIOD Look to continue to build and get in and around the goal and when we get in just shoot. with the offense missing opportunities to find the back of the net the Wolverine defense felt the pressure to shut down Bowling Green PERIOD It outmuscled outworked and outperformed PERIOD Play after play the defense swallowed every ball that came its way PERIOD When Michigans offense seemed to stall out the defense stepped up to create chances and restart the attack PERIOD

The core of Michigans defense are two veterans senior Sura Yekka and junior Alia Martin PERIOD Every player that took either of them came up emptyhanded and through  minutes Bowling Green didnt register a single shot on goal PERIOD

One of the biggest improvements from last year to this year is our defensive organization and presence Klein said PERIOD  We have to make sure that were really good at not giving the opponent a lot of chances in front of our net. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
