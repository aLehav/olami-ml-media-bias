Its grown pretty rapidly so we probably are at capacity for a while PERIOD We want to get everything settled in Alberta and hope to expand more in the future hopefully to a high school said Amy Buchanan one of the projects coordinators PERIOD

The program begins with secondgrade students and encourages children to continue with the game throughout their education PERIOD Students from UH  and UH  are paired with children with similar skill levels in order to coach and mentor during the school day and in after school programs PERIOD

For the kids research shows that this improves standardized test scores in both Math and English basically it improves all critical and analytical skills as well as the ability to focus PERIOD So overall it helps the kids improve in all facets Grider said PERIOD
