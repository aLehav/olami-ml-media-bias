Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



A recent hack of Apples iCloud resulted in graphic nude photos of almost  celebrities being stolen downloaded and shared on the Internet PERIOD

Among the celebrities targeted are Oscarwinner Jennifer Lawrence Kate Upton and Ariana Grande PERIOD

The photos were posted on 4chan Reddit Twitter Tumblr and blogs all over the world PERIOD

It is believed that this hack was a brute force attack meaning the hacker used a computer program that generates and tests thousands of potential passwords until an account is successfully entered according to a Sept PERIOD  CNN article PERIOD

Apple has denied that the hack was a result of a breach of its systems PERIOD

We have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names passwords and security questions a practice that has become all too common on the Internet Apple said in a statement PERIOD

None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apples systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. however the publication of Hollywood Alisters private photos has caused Apples stock to drop  percent in three days and the public to doubt the security of the information they store on their mobile devices PERIOD

When personal information is entered into a device whether it be pictures or financial information it does not leave the cyber world PERIOD

As evidenced by this recent hacking there are individuals capable of finding their way into the average individuals information PERIOD

Ali Miller freshman social studies education said she believes it would be wise for students to be cautious of the nature of the photos they take on their phones PERIOD

I think that a lot of opinion pieces about the massive leak have put more of the blame on the women for taking these pictures than on the actual people who invaded their privacy she said PERIOD

So I think that it is important to be smart about what youre doing and what youre sending. revealing photographs are not the only thing that people should be wary of when it comes to information sharing online PERIOD

Almost  million Americans have reported having their identities stolen in the past year and almost  percent of Americans have been victims of some sort of cyber crime according to stopthehacker.com PERIOD

It must also be noted that hacking someones personal information does not come with a small price to pay if the hacker is caught PERIOD

In  Christopher Chaney was charged with the hacking of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis email accounts PERIOD

Chaney was charged with accessing protected computers without authorization damaging protected computers wiretapping and aggravated identity theft according to CNN PERIOD

After pleading guilty in  Chaney is currently serving a 10year federal prison sentence PERIOD
