CHICAGO  During Tuesdays press conference Gophers senior Quincy Lewis said he hasnt ever met a gym he didnt like when asked about what its like to play at the United Center the former home of Michael Jordan PERIOD
Unfortunately for Lewis and the No PERIOD  Gophers mens basketball team the United Center treated Lewis like Jordan used to treat the defenders who tried to stop him PERIOD
Lewis was held to eight points on 3of17 shooting as 11thseeded Illinois   in the Big Ten upset Minnesota  in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament PERIOD It was the lowest scoring total for Lewis since Minnesota beat Michigan State in the tournament last season when he scored seven points PERIOD
He also was held to eight in the first game of last years tourney when the Gophers beat Northwestern  PERIOD His fourgame scoring average in the arena is an unLewislike  points per game PERIOD
And while the United Center was treating Lewis so badly it wrapped Illinois guard Cory Bradford up in its arms and gave him a big warm hug PERIOD The Big Ten Freshman of the Year scored a game high  points including 6of7 shooting from beyond the threepoint arc PERIOD
Bradford singlehandedly slammed the door on a valiant Gophers comeback with a threepointer from about  feet out that banked high off the glass before going in PERIOD That bucket gave the Illini a  lead and sparked an  run which enabled them to control the game PERIOD
After I made that one I knew anything would fall Bradford said when asked about his banked three PERIOD But to answer your question no I didnt call glass. his precision from beyond the arc was something that Bradford said surprised him PERIOD In the teams last two regular season games against Iowa and Indiana both losses Bradford went a combined 2of17 from long distance PERIOD
As Bradford was cuddling up and making friends with the backboards and nets Lewis said he was trying to find a way to remove a lid on the basket. lewis credited some aggressive Illini team defense for holding him to nearly  points less than his conferenceleading scoring average of . pERIOD
It just wasnt my night Lewis said PERIOD I want to give my teammates credit PERIOD I was just out of rhythm and the team proved they are good enough to play without me. just how good Minnesota really is will be a hot debate over the weekend PERIOD Entering the Big Ten Tournament the Gophers were considered a lock for the NCAA tournament PERIOD
Minnesota coach Clem Haskins said he is still positive his team will be part of the field of  which will be finalized on Sunday afternoon but this loss to Illinois did not help his teams case one bit PERIOD
We are confident that we are one of the 64best teams in the country Haskins said PERIOD We feel like this tournament was important in terms of our seeding in the tournament PERIOD We have a good power ranking weve played strong opponents and the Big Ten speaks for itself so we feel were in. whether the ninemember NCAA selection committee agrees with Haskins remains to be seen PERIOD
Minnesota  and Purdue  which lost in overtime earlier in the day to Michigan now both seem to be on the bubble PERIOD The Boilermakers finished a halfgame below the Gophers in the Big Ten standings PERIOD
If they do get into the tournament the Gophers will need a little bit of Bradfords luck to rub off on Lewis or at least find a way for him to blow that pesky lid off the hoop PERIOD
