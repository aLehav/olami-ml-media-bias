The world of fashion is very very good at pissing people off PERIOD Fur on a runway and draped across the chairs of the front row has led to PETA activists throwing paint and waving signs in protest PERIOD Models promote unhealthy ideals for children and are criticized mercilessly for their bodies the industry is criticized mercilessly for featuring them PERIOD Prominent fashion figures spout racist remarks PERIOD Everyone from agents to photographers is accused of sexual abuse PERIOD An impressive number of highfashion editorials are accused of cultural appropriation at best and downright racism at worst PERIOD

Terry Richardson is an offcolor highlyprovocative fashion photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Oprah to President Obama PERIOD He has also been repeatedly accused of being a sex offender PERIOD Although his imagery is provocative to put it lightly some models have accused him of bartering sex for fame PERIOD

It is an accepted fact that fashions are reflective of their era PERIOD During wars skirts got shorter to use less fabric PERIOD During periods of economic prosperity clothes became intricate and used expensive fabrics PERIOD But just as clearly and for better or for worse the fashion industry is also a highlyconcentrated representation of the issues of an era as well PERIOD
