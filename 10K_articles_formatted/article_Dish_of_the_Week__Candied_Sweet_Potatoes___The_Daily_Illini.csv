But perhaps the one dish that feels the most like home is my grandmas candied sweet potatoes PERIOD Its what makes the annual holiday meal so memorable PERIOD Just as a warning these arent exactly healthy for you PERIOD However that is what the holidays are about enjoying food family and comfort PERIOD If you follow the recipe below you will know exactly what I mean PERIOD
