Jess Shaffer  Tuesday October  

A sage movie quotation from Mean Girls once stated Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it. once again it seems that Lindsay Lohans wisdom is far from infallible PERIOD

Halloween is one of my holidays of the year PERIOD I mean who can complain about free candy and the opportunity to dress up Unfortunately for us college students age appropriate etiquette forces many of us to give up our trickortreating ways PERIOD With our opportunities for free goodies dwindling it is only logical that we instead use costumes to throw ourselves into the Halloween festivities PERIOD With the endless possibilities of grownup dressup Fridays wardrobe choices promise to cover the range of good bad hilarious and alarming PERIOD

As per the opening Mean Girls quotation lets talk about girls costume choices PERIOD You dont have to be Miss Cleo to predict the onslaught of scandalous outfits in this weekends future PERIOD Naughty costume choices seem to be a collegiate Halloween staple PERIOD And my guess is that weve all been guilty of donning shocking apparel at one point or another PERIOD Or at least most of us can admit to the temptation of taking a break from our normally classy attire PERIOD The mix of tenacity and bravery it takes to pull off that ultrashort ultraskimpy costume can be undeniably intoxicating PERIOD

But honestly what would Stacy and Clinton of TLCs What Not To Wear fame say to your Catwoman outfit Better yet what would your dad say to the scantily clad pirate wardrobe option

And then the weather is always a concern PERIOD Considering last nights first snowfall that micromini skirt might not be the most prudent choice for an offcampus trek PERIOD So before you choose to don your most scandalicous outfit be forewarned that your health unfortunate colds etc. and your rep might take a hit PERIOD Remember Lindsay Lohan isnt always right and Halloween isnt always an excuse for salaciousness PERIOD

Girls are not the only Halloween revelers that need a reality check PERIOD Most boys seem to exist on opposite ends of the spectrum as far as Halloween revelry is concerned PERIOD They seem to either go all out or to express a stereotypical apathy PERIOD

To the former good for you PERIOD To the latter muster up some enthusiasm PERIOD Stop leaving all the dressing up to the girls PERIOD Halfhearted costumes shouldnt cut it PERIOD For example wearing all black and being a body guard is lame PERIOD Similarly wearing ND apparel and being a fan is equally pathetic PERIOD Unless you are dressing up as a Halloween Scrooge halfhearted and nonexistent costumes wont suffice PERIOD Additionally pimps and gangsters are equally uninteresting PERIOD For once please shy away from boring stereotypical and lackluster outfits PERIOD

With this aforementioned list of concerns and complaints perhaps some costume suggestions are in order PERIOD For boys you cant go wrong by dressing up as a kissing booth an easy and adorable option PERIOD Knights in shining armor wont fail to sweep the girls off their feet PERIOD And for the extra committed theres always full on body suits like a gorilla or a chicken PERIOD

Girls dont be afraid to opt for cute over scandalous PERIOD Creativity is always appreciated PERIOD Maybe ditch the overused costume ideas and come up with something original PERIOD Or add twists to common ideas PERIOD Ensemble costumes like the Spice Girls or casts of movies are delightful and fun ways to coordinate PERIOD

Ultimately it takes all types to contribute to Halloweens wonder PERIOD It takes a mix of racy apparel cute classics and creative geniuses to bring out every side of the holiday PERIOD And with four days until the big day there is plenty of time for students to get their Halloween spirit into full gear PERIOD But with the combination of sugar highs fright fests and costume creativity theres not much to complain about this fall tradition PERIOD
