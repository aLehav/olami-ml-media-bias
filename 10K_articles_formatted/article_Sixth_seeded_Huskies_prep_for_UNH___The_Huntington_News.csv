The night was fitting for one of the proudest Husky senior classes in recent memory PERIOD

In fact you could have almost called it scripted PERIOD

In their final contest at Matthews Arena Saturday the mens hockey seniors put on a show for the  fans in attendance with four seniors scoring at least a goal and another two recording a point in an  thrashing of the University of Massachusetts PERIOD

The win which gave the Huskies a  record overall and a  finish in Hockey East sets up a pivotal bestofthree series with the University of New Hampshire starting tomorrow night  p.m. at the Whittemore Center in Durham N.H PERIOD

It was a senior night said Northeastern coach Bruce Crowder which was topped off by Jason Guerriero becoming the first Husky in history to win the HE scoring crown  points PERIOD I dont think in all the number of senior nights Ive been through Ive seen the number of guys all show up on the scoreboard and all have great games. uNH finished at  in HE and stands at  overall following its  loss to Boston University Saturday PERIOD The Wildcats swept the season series with NU with a  home win in November and then a  victory last month PERIOD

It really didnt matter to us Crowder said of which team NU would play PERIOD Because we knew wherever we were going to go we were going to have to make sure we were ready to come and play and make sure we play hard PERIOD We knew it wasnt going to be easy. northeastern opened a  lead just over a minute into the second period with seniors Guerriero five points Jared Mudryk and Tim Judy all having a hand in the process PERIOD However the Minutemen rushed back making it a onegoal game  minutes later PERIOD

But then Guerriero and first linemates junior Mike Morris six points and freshman Jimmy Russo responded PERIOD The trio combined for  points PERIOD

We got ourselves back into it and took ourselves right back out with a lot of undisciplined play UMass coach Don Cahoon said his team falling to  overall and finishing  in HE PERIOD They got a little bit loose and gave us a chance to take a run at them and we did PERIOD When we made it a one goalgame we had to tighten up and play zones as tight and as thoroughly as necessary PERIOD We werent able to do that. guerrieros goal that made it a  game and dashed any hopes of a UMass comeback came at the  mark of the final frame PERIOD Morris and Russo set up Guerriero who was waiting in the slot to put it behind Minuteman goalie Gabe Winer PERIOD

The linemates then switched roles for the teams next goal when Guerriero and Morris set up a skating Russo from the right side PERIOD

It was Guerrieros final point of the game an assist on Morris second goal of the game and the teams seventh at the  mark of the third that may have been the most crowdpleasing PERIOD

The Husky captain came across the blue line and seemed to toy with the UMass defense as he moved his way with ease to the right faceoff circle PERIOD Just when it seemed he would keep the puck for a shot he fired a pictureperfect pass to a wideopen Morris who then blasted the puck home for a fourgoal lead PERIOD

Sometimes things just bounce your way Guerriero said PERIOD They were tonight PERIOD Ive been playing with Morris since he got here my sophomore year PERIOD Hes a great player and hes going to be a great player in pro hockey someday PERIOD Russos contributing too he sees the ice really well and hes got all the aspects to play at the next level PERIOD Its an honor to play with both those guys. morris who finished the regular season with  points tied for fifth in HE achieved something significant in Crowders eyes PERIOD

Its tremendous six points in a Hockey East game thats unbelievable the coach said PERIOD It just doesnt happen in this day and age PERIOD He was clicking and finding the holes PERIOD Hes got a cannon for a shot and the biggest thing is him shooting it PERIOD Its something weve wanted out of him and I hope it continues next weekend. the night seemed to end perfectly for the Huskies as the first linemates had completed their work and three more seniors got into the act PERIOD

With just under a minute to play defenseman Jon Awe was skating just on top of the left faceoff circle and fired a shot in for the teams eighth goal PERIOD Fittingly enough assisting on the play were defenseman Jonathan Koop and netminder Keni Gibson PERIOD
