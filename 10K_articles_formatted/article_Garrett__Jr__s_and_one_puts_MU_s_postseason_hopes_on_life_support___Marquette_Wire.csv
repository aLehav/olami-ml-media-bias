In a backandforth match between two teams fighting to stay relevant in the BIG EAST standings DePaul   BIG EAST upended Marquette   BIG EAST and likely ended the Golden Eagles NCAA tournament chances PERIOD Billy Garrett Jr PERIOD converted an andone layup with . seconds left in regulation to give the Blue Demons a  victory at the BMO Harris Bradley Center Wednesday night PERIOD

It hurt Marquette head coach Steve Wojciechowski said PERIOD I thought we played harder tonight than we did in the Xavier game we just werent rewarded for it. squaring off against a team that entered  in BIG EAST play Marquette held a onepoint lead with . seconds remaining after redshirt sophomore Duane Wilson tipped in his own miss PERIOD DePaul head coach Dave Leitao called timeout and Wojciechowski subbed in 6foot4 freshman Sacar Anim in place of 6foot10 Henry Ellenson PERIOD Garrett Jr PERIOD was still able to use his speed to get around the double team and drive into the lane for the foul PERIOD

We wanted to get a lineup where we could switch ball screens Wojciechowski said PERIOD We knew they were going to go to Garrett and we wanted to try to double him in the backcourt and I thought a smaller more athletic lineup would be able to do that. the Golden Eagles normally dominantsize was virtually nonexistent throughout the game PERIOD Redshirt junior Luke Fischer picked up his second foul just two minutes  seconds into the game and was forced to sit out the rest of the first half PERIOD Freshman Matt Heldt collected just one rebound in  minutes while the Blue Demons outrebounded Marquette  to  PERIOD DePaul collected a whopping  offensive rebounds compared to the Golden Eagles six PERIOD

Henry Ellenson was contained to  points six rebounds four blocks and four turnovers for the game PERIOD His performance may be attributed to injuries to his shin and ankle which Wojciechowski confirmed will not keep him out of game action PERIOD

Hes a little banged up which is typical for this time of year especially with as much contact as he plays against and has to play through Wojciechowski said PERIOD

Both teams put on a porous offensive display in the first half PERIOD Marquette shot just . percent from the field including 3of10 from threepoint range PERIOD Not to be outdone the Blue Demons shot . percent in the half but  offensive rebounds created eight second chance points to propel them to a  halftime lead PERIOD The Golden Eagles scored one point in the final  of the half PERIOD

The offenses picked up marginally in the second half as Marquette kept up with DePauls attacks in the paint PERIOD The Golden Eagles used a  run capped by a Fischer turnaround jump shot to take a  lead with  remaining their first since it was  with  left in the first half PERIOD They would increase that lead to five thanks to six consecutive free throws  it was  with less than four minutes to play PERIOD

Marquette then turned the ball over five times in the final four minutes and allowed DePaul to tie the game at  with  remaining until Wilsons tipin  two of his  points on 7of10 shooting to go with four assists and no turnovers PERIOD

Duane had a terrific game Wojciechowski said PERIOD I thought it was maybe his best game of the season PERIOD He took good shots and I thought he made good decisions. garrett Jr.s ensuing gamewinning free throw gave DePaul its first victory in Milwaukee since Feb PERIOD   PERIOD He scored  points  all in the second half  while forward Myke Henry scored a teamhigh  points and grabbed  rebounds PERIOD The Blue Demons got their first conference victory since Feb PERIOD  of last year PERIOD

DePauls recordfor what it is theyve been in every single game that theyve played in and we knew that going in Fischer said PERIOD We knew it was going to be a tough fight Wejust gottaget over this hump. the Golden Eagles are riding a threegame losing streak  the teams longest losing streak since a sixgame skid between Feb PERIOD  to March  of last season  with the two easiest games remaining on the schedule coming this week PERIOD The team will travel to New York for a Saturday night matchup at Madison Square Garden against St PERIOD Johns which is  in the conference PERIOD Marquette will then return home Wednesday for a nonconference breather against  Stetson PERIOD
