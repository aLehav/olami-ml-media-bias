Eastern Michigan University students Jaida Turner and Jessica Turner are not just sisters but are also best friends who create music together PERIOD For many people music is a way to get through every mood which is especially true for the duo PERIOD

Jessica Turner is a senior at EMU majoring in marketing with a minor in African American studies Jaida Turner is an EMU sophomore studying art education PERIOD

As children beginning at ages  and  the sisters attended performing arts camps in the city of Detroit and ended up taking a liking to singing the most PERIOD

We always grew up singing PERIOD We did a lot of performing arts camps when we were younger so that was like acting singing dancing and we also sang at church Jaida Turner said PERIOD As we got older we just really liked singing a lot more like how we could be really creative with it so that kind of stuck with us. the purpose of their music is to uplift and inspire listeners as other artists music have done for them the sisters said PERIOD

The world we live in is kind of depressing when you think about it all the horrible stuff happening we just wanna uplift people give them hope Jessica Turner said PERIOD

The duo described their music as contemporary gospel has a more pop sound while their second single Gods Love sounds more like jazzy RB. i would say Gods Love our second song is my favorite because we got to spend a lot of time on that one and really perfect it Jessica Turner said PERIOD We really took our time on that one and I just like how we sing in that one. the sisters said that they enjoy putting their individual interests and personalities together in their music to create something unique PERIOD

We take our own individual vibes and kind of put it together and our own experiences together so its an experience Jaida Turner said PERIOD I feel like I have a more funky jazz vibe and then Jessicas more like that RB chill. while some siblings may have a hard time getting along with one another Jaida Turner and Jessica Turners friendship makes their music feel far from work PERIOD

Sometimes its difficult because like I want it this certain way so we have to compromise but thats just working together so thats working with anyone Jaida Turner said PERIOD

The musicians goal is to release an EP in the near future and eventually a fulllength album PERIOD

Working with other artists too because we havent did any collabs or anything so I think that would be cool Jessica Turner said PERIOD

Some of their inspirations include another sister gospel duo Mary Mary as well as Detroit group The Clark Sisters PERIOD

They did a lot of big things in gospel music and they kind of paved the way for other artists in having a different sound then traditional gospel music Jessica Turner said PERIOD

The impact of music overall is something that the Turners find important to their personal lives and their artistry PERIOD

It can impact your mood it can inspire you like if youre feeling down in life it can inspire you give you hope Jessica Turner said PERIOD Also music can make you realize youre not the only one going through certain stuff because a lot of people share their stories in their music. with this process were really like learning and growing and discovering ourselves in our music so its just a journey Jaida Turner said PERIOD
