BROOKLINE  Entering last weeks twogame homestand at Parsons Field the mens soccer team needed some good fortune PERIOD They had yet to win a game in the Colonial Athletic Association CAA and found themselves on the wrong side of the standings PERIOD

What a difference a week can make PERIOD Two victories in three days have brought the Huskies hopes for postseason play closer to reality as Northeastern   CAA defeated UNCWilmington    and Georgia State     PERIOD

Against UNCWilmington the Huskies needed a lastminute penalty kick from senior captain Tom Heimreid to seal their first victory in conference play and second of the season PERIOD The penalty came in the 82d minute after freshman and newly converted forward Andrew Konopelsky was taken down inside the box PERIOD

Head coach Brian Ainscough moved Konopelsky up top away from his usual position on defense hoping to inject some muchneeded energy in the frontline PERIOD

Greg Kilkenny has been acting as our only forward for much of the season Ainscough said PERIOD Andrew even when hes playing defense likes to get forward so we decided to try him out up top. uNCWilmington opened the scoring  minutes into the game when freshman forward Tim Masters beat senior goalkeeper Sergio Saccoccio giving the Seahawks a  lead PERIOD That lead took them to halftime but did not last much longer as sophomore midfielder Padraig Tangney met a cross from freshman midfielder Nick Patrikis and headed home the tying goal just four minutes into the second half PERIOD

Sundays game against Georgia State was the final home game for Northeasterns five seniors who ended their career at Parsons Field with the teams second consecutive win of the season beating the Panthers  PERIOD Jay Betley Jeff Gannon Tom Heimreid David Downing and  Saccoccio were honored before kickoff PERIOD

The Husky offense was commanding early dominating in possession time over a Panther team content with staying back and playing defense PERIOD However GSU goalie Felipe Carvalho kept the ball out of the net for the first half PERIOD

Senior captain Jeff Gannon had the best chance in the first  minutes taking a pass from Konopelsky just outside the penalty box PERIOD His effort from  yards out was hard and low but Carvalho was able to get his fingertips on it tipping it away for a corner PERIOD

Going into the half  Ainscough said he felt his team was not aggressive enough with its opportunities PERIOD

We started well but we let up a little bit on them towards the end of the half Ainscough said PERIOD I think if we kept the pressure on them we might have gotten something out of the first half. the Huskies started the second half much like they did the first but this time did not let up PERIOD Konopelsky and Kilkenny continually put pressure on the Panthers defense and it seemed just a matter of time before the Huskies would crack the scoreboard PERIOD

They had to wait until the sixty-first minute off a corner kick as junior defender Matt Handy scored his first goal for Northeastern firing home a loose ball past Carvalho giving the Huskies a  lead PERIOD

That lead would double with  minutes left in the game as Kilkenny found himself just outside the box with time to set up a shot PERIOD The sophomore forward made no mistake with the open opportunity firing a low leftfooted blast into the bottom right corner for his teamleading fifth goal of the year PERIOD

While Sunday was a celebration of the careers of five Husky seniors the focus of Ainscoughs squad remains fixed on extending their season PERIOD Compiling six points from two games this week Northeastern now finds itself in a threeway tie for fourth place with Towson and Virginia Commonwealth in the CAA standings PERIOD

Were looking forward to practice this week Gannon said PERIOD We have three games left and are in a good position after this weekend. the independent student newspaper of Northeastern University",Menâ€™s Soccer: Offense returns as Huskies win two straight - The Huntington News,Northeastern University
