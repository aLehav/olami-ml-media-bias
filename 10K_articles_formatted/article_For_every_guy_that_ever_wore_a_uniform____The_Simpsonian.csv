When the Simpson football team takes the field for thisSaturdays Homecoming game against Loras the team is playing foranything but personal glory PERIOD

When you put on a Simpson helmet youre not only playing foryourself and the guys on this team but youre playing for everyguy that ever wore a uniform here head coach Jay Niemannsaid PERIOD

The players tend to agree PERIOD

There isnt more importance on the game but alumni come backand we want to put on a good show for them said junior middlelinebacker Chris Kern PERIOD A lot of guys before us busted their buttsin the Simpson uniform  we want to do the same. niemann said Homecoming and Parents Day are times when the teamreally wants to put its best foot forward PERIOD He said the team triesto show alumni that they have a quality football team and programhere at Simpson PERIOD

A lot of alumni come to games and it still means a lot tothem said junior wide receiver Dusty Kain PERIOD They take losses justas hard as we do. the Loras Duhawks are coming to Buxton Stadium this Homecomingin hopes of turning their season around PERIOD

Loras head coach Bob Bierie summed up their season so far withone word disappointing PERIOD

The Duhawks have had some close games go against them this yearthe worst being a  homecoming loss to Buena Vista in theclosing minutes PERIOD The Duhawks jumped out to an early  leadagainst the Beavers but couldnt hold on for the win PERIOD

The Duhawks have lost several games by small margins PERIOD Besidesfalling to the Beavers by five they lost to St PERIOD Ambrose by two athome and to at Central by a field goal to stand at  overall and22 in the Iowa Conference PERIOD
