Do you want to learn how to better manage finances Help is coming PERIOD

The Minority Advisors Program is sponsoring the Success Skills Scholarship and Financial Aid workshop at  p.m PERIOD in the Multipurpose Room of the Black Cultural Center PERIOD

The workshop will also highlight scholarships and how to keep them PERIOD

Everyone is encouraged to attend and receive advice on how to win and keep scholarships after the first year of college PERIOD The workshop will feature financial aid experts speaking about different scholarships that are available for returning college students PERIOD

You know when you were an entering freshman there was all this money thrown at you PERIOD We want to help students continue to get that money said Tierney Bates assistant director of the Black Cultural Center PERIOD

Although the minority program is aimed toward mentoring minority freshmen the sponsored workshops are to aid all students in various areas of their lives and college careers PERIOD

We thought it would be beneficial to devote a special program to this because there are students who need more financial assistance in paying for schooling PERIOD Yet many think that scholarships are only available to incoming students PERIOD Since there is an array of scholarships out we would like to help students with that said Phillip Fitzgerald secretary of the minority program PERIOD

This year the need for specialized help in financial aid for students has increased  not only for the students who have to work to pay their way through college but for recipients of the AfricanAmerican Achievers Scholarship as well PERIOD The AAA scholarship will still exist at the university but changes made regarding the requirements altered the program PERIOD

We really got the idea to do this because of the AAA scholarship Bates said PERIOD No longer can students receive money simply for being AfricanAmerican or Latino.. PERIOD This program was designed to look at ways to get money while youre still in college not just as you come in as a freshman. this is the second workshop of a series to help students be successful throughout their first year PERIOD The first workshop Facebook Etiquette was held last month PERIOD

Our next success skills workshop will be on business dinner etiquette Fitzgerald said PERIOD And it will be on Nov PERIOD fifteenth in the Hermitage Room at  p.m.
