Unfortunately it also put him in massive danger since the stillfaulty downloading process tends to cause subjects heads to explode after a short while PERIOD With the clock ticking thats definitely a concern director and supervising producer David Rogers says adding that Season 2s finale did close on Nathan  shortly after sleeping with Nora  experiencing a nosebleed PERIOD That leaves the audience and Nathan wondering Oh what does this mean

We find out early on in Season  which digs deeper into how Lakeviews parent company Horizen is connected to a new free afterlife alternative and what they plan to do with so many uploaded consciousnesses PERIOD There is a conspiracy says Rogers of a timely twist related to voter fraud that will keep Nora and Nathan on their toes PERIOD

At the same time the newly promoted Aleesha Zainab Johnson who will have some drama with her former office bestie Nora begins to see just how messy Horizen is from the inside PERIOD She carries a lot of scenes Rogers teases PERIOD
