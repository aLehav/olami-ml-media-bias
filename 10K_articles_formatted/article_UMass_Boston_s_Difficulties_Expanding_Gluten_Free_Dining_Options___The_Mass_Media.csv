1754,2023-10-30,"on Jan PERIOD  when a Mass Media reporter visited the cafeteria employees at two of the five stations serving food did not know what gluten was PERIOD At the remaining three stations only one employee at Pandini was able to say whether or not the food he was serving contained gluten PERIOD It did. on Jan PERIOD  the Boston Globe ran an article by staff writer Akilah Johnson about the options available to students suffering from celiac disease in local university cafeterias including UMass Boston PERIOD In the article Diane DArrigo assistant vice chancellor for campus services told the Globe that the university stays attuned to the different dietary needs of students. however the staff of Sodexo the contractor that serves food to UMass Boston are largely unable to direct celiac students toward appropriate food PERIOD

Celiac is a disorder that causes a person to become intolerant to gluten which is found in wheat PERIOD Those with the disorder experience nausea and other stomach problems after ingesting wheat and in the long term studies have demonstrated those afflicted are more likely to develop cancer if they are exposed to wheat on a regular basis PERIOD Because people with celiac are often sensitive to even traces of gluten their food must be prepared in a separate glutenfree area with equipment that has not touched wheat PERIOD

In December the US Department of Justice declared celiac disease a disability that must be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA PERIOD The ruling was a direct response to a lawsuit filed against Lesley University in Cambridge which until recently did not provide glutenfree food in its cafeteria PERIOD The decision made by UMass Boston and other universities to expand their glutenfree offerings is a direct response to the expansion of the ADA PERIOD

The Globe article explains that UMass Boston has a glutenfree zone in its food court with a separate refrigerator microwave and toaster to minimize the risk of contamination but Mass Media reporters could find no glutenfree toaster in the cafeteria PERIOD Additionally there is some confusion among cafeteria staff regarding what glutenfree means PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  when a Mass Media reporter visited the cafeteria employees at two of the five stations serving food did not know what gluten was PERIOD At the remaining three stations only one employee at Pandini was able to say whether or not the food he was serving contained gluten PERIOD It did. dave Danells the general manager of oncampus food service asserted that all of his staff knew about celiac and glutenfree food PERIOD At the beginning of each semester he said we go and talk with the different stations and the people that are manning those stations and educate them. danells stated that a student with celiac could check with the chef whos at the station and find out what he or she could eat. danells referred to the Its a Wrap station during his interview PERIOD We have glutenfree bread over there PERIOD We have a separate cutting board and knife. however employees at Its a Wrap were among those who did not understand what glutenfree meant PERIOD

During a separate visit on Jan PERIOD  Its a Wrap employees showed the reporter every type of bread in the station one loaf at a time until the employees found the glutenfree bread PERIOD The employees then cut a glutenfree sandwich on the same cutting board and toasted it in the same toaster as all the other sandwiches contaminating the glutenfree bread with wheat PERIOD

According to Danells Its a Wrap is not the only place to get glutenfree food PERIOD Depending on the day of the week we have a glutenfree Sizzle menu at the Sizzle station. employees at Sizzle when asked on Jan PERIOD  did know what gluten was but werent sure whether the food at their station was glutenfree PERIOD

Burger King employees did not know what gluten was PERIOD Harbor Market employees knew what gluten was but they were unsure about whether or not it was in their food PERIOD

Finally Danells pointed out that the glutenfree zone in the cafeteria contained brownies and cookies safe for students with celiac PERIOD However these are often sold out and a cashier told reporters that Sodexo has struggled to replace the pastries quickly enough PERIOD

Danells believed that even when employees dont know whether an item is safe for a person with celiac managers will PERIOD If we did have a disconnect someplace Id ask the student customer to seek out a manager he said PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  supervisor Randolfo Lopez was unable to answer any questions about glutenfree options PERIOD I dont really know he said before advising reporters to contact regional nutrition manager Danielle Shargorodsky PERIOD Another floor manager who did not give her name was unable to locate the glutenfree bread at Its a Wrap PERIOD

The Globe article mentioned that a nutritionist is also available. its possible that the article was referring to Shargorodsky who comes by UMass Boston once a month to consult with students PERIOD When contacted Shargorodsky said Its a big initiative of mine food allergies PERIOD Its so important. shargorodsky also stated that Kens the brand of dressing used at the UMass Boston salad bar is glutenfree PERIOD She repeated Danells assertion that all our staff is welltrained then added We do have glutenfree pasta in the back You can ask a manager. managers in the cafeteria have not heard of any glutenfree pasta and Danells was certain that there was none on campus PERIOD We dont have it yet he said but its available. uMass Bostons independent studentrun newspaper",UMass Boston’s Difficulties Expanding Gluten-Free Dining Options – The Mass Media,University of Massachusetts Boston
