When freshman goalie Sam Swenson came out of the goal rushing the offense to create pressure Stanford had a quick rebound that led to a shot on an open net PERIOD Redshirt junior back Mackenzie Ellis however ran in from the corner swatting the shot out of the air holding off Stanfords 7thranked offense once more on Sunday PERIOD

Despite losing in overtime Ellis and junior back Lauren Thomas collaborated to create a nearly impenetrable defense as the Michigan Field Hockey team fell  to the Cardinal PERIOD

Ellis had numerous critical defensive plays that deterred Stanfords offense which otherwise dominated possession in the second half PERIOD Ellis physically outplayed numerous Cardinal forwards stripping them off the ball without much adversary and keeping the Wolverines neckandneck with No PERIOD  Stanford PERIOD

Along with a stellar performance from Ellis who also had numerous blocks interceptions and deflections that eased the defensive load on Swenson Thomas too played a leadership position role on defense PERIOD Thomas called out plays and opportunities for the Wolverines and earned numerous steals on Cardinal advances while also successfully holding on to possession PERIOD

Its just another day another dollar Ellis said PERIOD Its a lot of guts and no glory but thats just what our job is. although midfielders Sammy Gray and Lauren Hague played impressive defensive games stripping Stanford players of possession and holding the ball well the backs are where the defense shined PERIOD Thanks to the combined efforts of Ellis and Thomas kept the Cardinals shots to eight and gave away no corners PERIOD

However despite the fact that the Michigan defense held up well the offense couldnt finish to get in the lead though they showed improvements from games earlier in the season PERIOD

While the Wolverines dominated the field for the first half of the game Stanford came back fired up after the half scoring a goal minutes into the second half and maintained possession the better part of the half PERIOD

Until their breakaway in overtime when they scored the gamewinning goal the Cardinal struggled to handle the combination of Ellis and Thomas PERIOD

I think that we stepped up as a unit together we took them toetotoe and we dominated them in a lot of ways but we just have to work on those last few finishes Thomas said PERIOD As the season goes on were all bonding more and more as a team and really seeing what each others strengths and weaknesses are working off of that. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
