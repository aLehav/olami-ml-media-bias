When Athens and Atlanta have such vibrant music scenes its easy to forget that music is everywhere and bands can form in surprising places PERIOD This was the case for the high school friends who formed the band Dalmatian in Macon PERIOD

Michael Suhr was playing with one of our buddies here in Macon and he and I ended up in Atlanta together he was at Georgia State and I was at Georgia Tech and we started playing music together jamming in dorm rooms and stuff like that said Burgess Brown one of the groups singers and multiinstrumentalist PERIOD

The group began with the chemistry between Suhr Brown and guitarist Brantly Macfie and was later filled out with a few more players PERIOD

We didnt want to just be a three piece Brown said PERIOD Weve known John Ewing for years PERIOD We went to school with him here in Macon and brought him in on drums PERIOD After that Sean Williams is another friend of ours we went to school with and he plays bass PERIOD He was friends with guitarist Heath Abney who was the final piece of the puzzle PERIOD It was a steady fill out. dalmatian released its first EP Dances with Dalmatian in October of last year PERIOD The album plants the band firmly in the altfolk genre and mixes bright instrumentation while taking advantage of the groups three singers with pleasant harmonies especially on Old Boy the opening track PERIOD The closing track Youre Light is a standout adding in blues for an enjoyable mix of sounds PERIOD

The bands members were all in college during the formation of the band making the recording of its first EP difficult PERIOD However the group has found greater camaraderie now that all of its members have relocated to Macon PERIOD

It was really tough recording the first EP because we were all going to different schools PERIOD Some of us were in Macon Atlanta we were spread out across the state PERIOD We would all take weekends to come back to Macon which is our home base PERIOD We would come back and have these marathon weekends of recording PERIOD Although the recording took several months it really happened in just a few weekends Burgess said PERIOD Weve moved into a house together and we have a studio set up in the basement PERIOD With the EP that were working on now the process has been a lot more organic PERIOD We just kind of walk down to the basement which is a really nice luxury to have. dalmatians altfolk rock sound is present in its first EP but will likely come across differently at the Green Room due to the energy present in its live performance PERIOD

If you want to know who we are you have to see our live show Suhr said PERIOD Theres a lot of energy a lot of hip shaking booty quaking and foot stomping. the group has been playing frequently around Macon and Milledgeville but is preparing to break into other cities including Athens PERIOD

Thisll be our Athens debut and were really excited about it PERIOD Weve all had friends at UGA for the last four years and Michael actually went to UGA for a little while so were familiar with the music scene Burgess said PERIOD Were excited to be a part of it. dalmatian Reverend Rabies Scythe Fight  Mother the Car
