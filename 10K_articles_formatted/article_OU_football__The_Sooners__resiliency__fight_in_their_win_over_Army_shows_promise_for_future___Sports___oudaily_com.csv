 Riley said PERIOD 

Saturday showed just how tough the rest of Oklahomas remaining schedule will be PERIOD

Texas Tech stomped Oklahoma State on the road Texas may actually be back after beating TCU and West Virginia looked like the best team in the conference with its win over Kansas State PERIOD

 redshirt junior defensive lineman Neville Gallimore said PERIOD 

Gallimore and Oklahomas defense showed signs of vulnerability against Army  a lack of tackling was the biggest takeaway PERIOD
