Could electric bicycles ebikes someday become a primary exploration method in our national parks Due to a surge in popularity the National Park Service NPS recently sought public input to help further evaluate the viability of ebikes throughout the national park system PERIOD

For those unfamiliar with ebikes they are bicycles with a motor and rechargeable batteries that assist the rider with pedaling PERIOD Riders can cycle further and faster with motorenhanced foot power PERIOD

Laws for ebikes can vary by state or country PERIOD The bicycle industry generally categorizes ebikes by a threeclass system based on top speed and components PERIOD

A motor only engages with class  ebikes while the rider pedals PERIOD That pedal assistance stops when the bike reaches a speed of  miles per hour PERIOD

A class  ebike offers pedal assistance but also has a throttle PERIOD A rider may use the motor exclusively to power the bike up to  miles per hour PERIOD

Class  ebikes typically have a speedometer and assist up to  miles per hour PERIOD

Technological advancements in bicycle components quickly rechargeable batteries and lightweight motors have led to the increased adoption of ebikes as an efficient ecofriendly and convenient travel method PERIOD

A market research study byFortune Business Insightsreveals a global ebike market evaluation of . billion for  PERIOD The study projects the ebike market to reach . billion this year PERIOD

Kevin Madzia Information Technology Manager atCentury Cyclesin Peninsula Ohio says 

Naaman Horn Public Affairs Specialist for the NPS Intermountain Regional Office says 

White Sands National Parkis one of the sites within Horns region PERIOD Bicyclists are permitted on Dunes Drive but may not participate in offroad biking PERIOD Currently very minimal cycling activity occurs at the park PERIOD

Cyclists may wonder what qualifies Century Cycles to comment on ebike usage in national parks PERIOD The answer is that  of their ebike rental customers ride in theCuyahoga Valley National ParkCVNP PERIOD

Madzia says 

Many park visitors speculate on the volume of ebikes in the national parks PERIOD Although each park site is different bicycling is one of the most popular activities in CVNP PERIOD Madzia states 

When asked if CVNP has seen a surge in accidents due to increased ebike rentals Madzia said  As far as complaints go he elaborated There are also many complaints that walkers dont supervise their children or pets properly PERIOD Since ebikes have become more popular some of these complaints involve ebikes but the overall number of complaints has not really increased.Only Class  ebikes are allowed on carriage roads in the park PERIOD Class  and Class  ebikes are prohibited on carriage roads PERIOD All classes of ebikes are permitted on roads open to motor vehicles.When using Acadias carriage roads its important to yield properly to other users  bikes to all others pedestrians to horses. whether or not mass adoption of ebikes across our national park system occurs remains to be seen PERIOD Many factors go into such a decision PERIOD Some parks preserve areas of cultural and historical significance while others protect delicate ecosystems with various wildlife and vegetation PERIOD

On the one hand ebikes make travel easier expand access for visitors with physical limitations reduce the carbon footprint compared to cars and provide healthy recreation opportunities PERIOD However the NPS must balance convenience and enhanced visitor experience with the potential impact on natural and cultural resources PERIOD They want to maintain the parks beauty history and values PERIOD

The NPS must also consider safety issues with more bicycle riders PERIOD Although exploring a national park by ebike is compelling the NPS must implement appropriate parameters and safety precautions to protect the parks and visitors PERIOD If all visitors regardless of transportation mode can learn to share the road ebikes offer an exciting way to explore natural wonders PERIOD
