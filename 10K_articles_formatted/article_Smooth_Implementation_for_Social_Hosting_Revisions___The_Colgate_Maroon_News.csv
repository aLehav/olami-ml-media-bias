Last semester Colgate enacted new Social Hosting Guidelines which were articulated by Dean of the College Suzy Nelson in cooperation with the Student Government Association SGA PERIOD The new Guidelines were subjected to much debate and revision prior to enactment but their initial implementation has gone well PERIOD

The changes to the Guidelines included distinction between types of social gatherings small private events large invitation events and catered events each of which must follow certain respective stipulations including registration policies alcohol guidelines and presence of Training for Intervention Procedures TIPScertified hosts PERIOD Additionally food and nonalcoholic drinks must be provided throughout the duration of an event and university officials may check on an event prior to it or during it PERIOD The Guidelines in their entirety may be found on the Colgate website PERIOD

Assistant Dean for Campus Life Fouad Saleet estimates events registered under the new Guidelines average about  a month PERIOD While the Greek community is responsible for many of these events there are also many that are held unaffiliated with a Greek organization including those hosted by Broad Street interest houses and other nonGreek student organizations PERIOD

SGA Senior Policy Coordinator and member of Theta Chi fraternity senior James Speight contributed to the new Guidelines and hopes their continued use will promote more events hosted by the nonGreek community PERIOD

A goal that is still being pursued is the diversity of registered social events  a disproportionate amount of registered events are hosted in Greek residences Speight said PERIOD SGA began piloting a food grant system to help subsidize food and nonalcoholic beverages for registered events hosted outside of Greek residences and the hope is that more students will utilize the system. registration for an event is through Colgates Get Involved website which is faster and easier than the previous paper registration PERIOD Were registrants to encounter problems however Saleet hosts open hours every Wednesday to help students plan prepare for and register events PERIOD

Social Chair of Theta Chi fraternity sophomore Ben Fortgang hasnt encountered any issues yet with the new system PERIOD The new guidelines are fairly easy to follow and require an open and honest relationship with the

administration Fortgang said PERIOD

Speight feels the initial implementation of the Guidelines have been successful PERIOD

With regards to implementation of the new social hosting procedure the initial roll out has been very successful PERIOD Many of the goals that were set prior to implementation are being achieved Speight said PERIOD Examples of visible benefits are an expedited process increased numbers of TIPStrained students and much more positive interactions and relationships with Campus Safety. current SGA Vice President and former president of Sigma Chi fraternity senior Matt Haley agrees the changes have overwhelmingly had positive effects PERIOD

The changes have been a good show of the Universitys trust in the fraternities and other organizations to throw safe and successful events Haley said PERIOD I think the implementation has gone very well with safer events being the result of this social hosting policy PERIOD Overall it really empowers the organizations to take responsibility of their event and make sure it is wellmanaged safe and successful. the new Guidelines have caused fraternities and other organizations to make changes in the way in which they approach their preparation of and planning for events PERIOD

We have made changes in making nonalcoholic beverages and food more available during the party which really was not a major change Haley said PERIOD Further we have had to delegate more responsibility to the social chairs for organizing events including assigning brothers as bartenders for the night wristband distribution and sober monitors.This has led to better thoughtout and organized events. the Greek students at least from my interactions have found the program to be better than the previous process PERIOD They are having an easier time discussing issues that come up and working with me to troubleshoot problems as they arise Saleet said PERIOD I have also heard from a few organization presidents that the process has strengthened their relationship with Campus Safety who conducts preparty meetings with the organizations right before their events. fortgang agrees with Saleet despite a few changes that could have been made PERIOD

I feel that the new social hosting policies are going well despite a few minor flaws Fortgang said PERIOD For example I believe that the banning of kegs is greatly detrimental to not only control of the influx of alcohol at a party but also not very sustainable considering the amount of cans that are used on a weekly basis. we have enjoyed the new policy Haley said PERIOD It has let us namely our social chairs meet and better understand and get to know the Campus Safety officers who are on call for the night when they walk through to make sure we are all set up for a safe event. contact Selina Koller at emailprotected PERIOD
