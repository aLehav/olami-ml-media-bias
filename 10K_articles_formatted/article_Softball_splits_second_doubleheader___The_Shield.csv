No PERIOD  Southern Indiana lost the second game of a GLVC doubleheader by one run after a failed comeback attempt for the second time in two days PERIOD

USI rallied from being down  in game two on Sunday when they came within one run of tying late in the game PERIOD Second basewoman Claire Johnson homered to center field scoring what ended up being USIs last run in the  loss PERIOD

Both teams were scoreless going into the fourth inning until Rockhursts shortstop Lauren Marks homered off of USI starting pitcher Courtney Atkisson  bringing in three runs PERIOD Later in the inning Rockhurst picked up another run off an RBI single by centerfielder Megan Freitag PERIOD

In the fifth USI began their attempt at rallying back by scoring three runs PERIOD Two of them cameoff RBI singles by shortstop Lexi Reese and right fielder Grace Clark PERIOD USI also picked up a free run after third basewoman Mena Fulton was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded PERIOD USI ended the inning with the bases loaded PERIOD

The final runs scored for both teams came in the sixth inning including the winning run for Rockhurst PERIOD USIs Jennifer Leonhardt  who was pitching in relief of Atkisson allowed her only run of the weekend to Rockhurst second basewoman Kelsey Tepen who singled up the middle scoring teammate Lauren Marks for what became the gamewinning run PERIOD

I think it was the fact that we didnt get on top of them early and they scored the first runs Leonhardt said PERIOD We knew we had to fight back and our defense wasnt the best today PERIOD We know we have stuff to work on all the way around. leonhardt said she needs to do a better job ending innings after getting the first two outs instead of allowing opposing teams to extend innings by giving them opportunities to score that they shouldnt have PERIOD

When Leonhardt gave up the winning run in game two she was one out away from ending the inning PERIOD

We were down four nothing and we always battle back but it left us in a hole Sue Kunkle

USIs head coach said PERIOD Were good at coming back but thats a tough loss because thats a team we should beat PERIOD We have to win some games next weekend. kunkle said the team left too many runners on base during the second game and her players shouldnt rely on power hitting as much in those situations PERIOD

USI ended the game with eight runners left on base and loaded the bases in the first inning and the fifth but only managed to score a total of two runs with the bases loaded PERIOD

USI did manage to take Sundays first game after another stellar performance from Leonhardt PERIOD

She finished the weekend with two complete game shutouts and a . eRA PERIOD For her efforts Leonhardt was named GLVC Softball Pitcher of the Week PERIOD

The Eagles won game one  after scoring all six runs in the fifth inning including an RBI single from Leonhardt and a threerun double by shortstop Lexi Reese PERIOD

With the loss USI sits at  in conference play PERIOD They play another GLVC game Saturday against Drury University followed by more conference play on Sunday against the Missouri University of Science and Technology PERIOD
