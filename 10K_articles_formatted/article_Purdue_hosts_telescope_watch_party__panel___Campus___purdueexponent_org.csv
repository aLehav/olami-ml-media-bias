Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm































The first fullcolor images from the James Webb Space Telescope were released in a livestream Tuesday morning PERIOD

A watch party was hosted in the Hiler Theater in WALC where the images from the telescope were projected onto large screens PERIOD

As the seconds ticked down to the reveal two graduate students who organized the watch party were jumping in anticipation and almost every one of the  people in the auditorium were leaning forward in their seats PERIOD

The first five fullcolor images were of the Carina nebula WASP96b the Southern Ring Nebula Stephans Quintet and SMACS  PERIOD

As each of the images was shown whistles and  came from everyone gathered to watch PERIOD

Michelle Thaller the host of NASAs livestream from its Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland told viewers Many are gathered around the world to watch this event. to which Danny Milisavljevic responded enthusiastically from the audience Yeah like here

Milisavljevic an assistant professor of physics and astronomy brought together a team of  scientists across the world according to previous Exponent reporting to prepare a proposal to investigate Cassiopeia A a supernova remnant in the constellation Cassiopeia using the Webb telescope PERIOD

I thought we would be stronger as a team to go in together he said in a previous Exponent report PERIOD Its the broadest base of interdisciplinary scientists you could dream of PERIOD

Our Webb program is targeting the debris field of a supernova explosion PERIOD Its kind of like doing an autopsy on a star that exploded about  years ago PERIOD This specific supernova remnant is the best example we have of an exploded star to analyze in this way. with the release of the first images Milisavljevic is closer to his teams dreams than ever before PERIOD

I actually just got an email this morning Milisavljevic said the proposal is locked in the schedule PERIOD We should get the images in about two weeks. the images released today show the power of the James Webb telescope compared to previous space telescopes like the Hubble PERIOD

The clarity of the images gives much more information than we previously had Milisavljevic said PERIOD The images pushed the envelope of my ability to understand what I was seeing. the Hubble space telescopes famous deepfield images took weeks according to NASAs website PERIOD The James Webb telescope took its image of the SMACS  galaxy cluster in just over  hours of exposure PERIOD

Its important to compare the images to previous ones said Bhagya Subrayan a graduate student in physics and astronomy PERIOD Thats what they will talk more about at  p.m PERIOD Thursday with a panel of five to  experts discussing each image from the James Webb telescope PERIOD The panel will include several Purdue professors and graduate students PERIOD

It will be at the Hiler Theater in WALC and will be livestreamed PERIOD The link for the livestream and more information can be found on the Purdue physics and astronomy linktree linktr.eepurduephysastro PERIOD
