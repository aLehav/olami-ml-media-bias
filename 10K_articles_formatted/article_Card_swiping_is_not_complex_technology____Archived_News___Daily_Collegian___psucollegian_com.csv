While the dorm access system used by Penn State is efficient it isnt exactly the latest technology as the article  Feb PERIOD  article asserts PERIOD

The article itself states that Penn State has been using door access readers since  PERIOD In the world of technology thats a lifetime PERIOD

Now biometrics technology that identifies people by fingerprints eyesand other physical characteristics is seeing its first wave of commercial use PERIOD

Even though this technology might seem too far in the future a la Minority Report to most of us one university has already utilized this technology PERIOD

Johnson and Wales University in Denver uses fingerprint identification for access to three dorms and several academic buildings PERIOD

Biometrics are also starting to be used in other public functions PERIOD ING Direct uses digital fingerprints in their banks a hospital in Columbus Ohio is using them to identify their doctors Sunmaid and Krispy Kreme are using them for employee clockin and out and it is soon to be used in the Manhattan Plaza one of New Yorks largest apartment complexes PERIOD

As it turns out card swiping is already starting to be phased out as identification and I wouldnt be surprised to see biometics employed at Penn State on one of my visits back as an alumnus PERIOD
