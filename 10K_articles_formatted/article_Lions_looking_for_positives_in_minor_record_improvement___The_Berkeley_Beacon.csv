7903,2023-11-01,"in September  the Emerson mens soccer team lost by five goals to Massachusetts Institute of Technology when they were shut out by their fellow New England Womens and Mens Athletic Conference team PERIOD

Almost exactly one year later on Sep PERIOD   the whistle sounded after  minutes of play between Emerson and MIT to indicate the arrival of overtime and more importantly Emersons neckandneck play against the reigning conference champions PERIOD

Last year the Lions were  and this year they also won five games with  losses after two games were cut from the schedule PERIOD But if you looked at Emersons record for each year and saw the number five indicating the amount of wins for both years you wouldnt know that the team had improved at all PERIOD

The season was better than last year and the record is almost identical head coach Javier Mejia  said PERIOD Just looking at the numbers from someone outside the program you wouldnt think there was any improvement PERIOD People would say They kind of stagnated they plateaued no improvements there. fortunately the team doesnt feel that way. last year was the former marketing majors first season coaching and the team had to adjust PERIOD

The guys were getting used to me the new coaching style PERIOD We made some adjustments in training and matches tried a new formation but all these things take time Mejia said PERIOD This year the players that were returning understood my coaching philosophy better so we didnt have to worry about that as much PERIOD We made some strategy and tactical adjustments which take some time as well PERIOD But I think everybody agrees that weve been playing better. a breakdown of their wins shows this to be truegames were much closer than they have been in recent years PERIOD Last year out of seven conference games played six were lost by a deficit of more than one goal PERIOD This year only two were lost by two or more goalsand one game was a win PERIOD

The Lions earned their firstever New England Womens and Mens Athletic Conference win against Coast Guard this year making school history when sophomore forward Max DeLuca scored the only goal of the game during the thirty-first minute PERIOD

It was unbelievable senior captain and forwardmidfielder Duncan Bochicchio said PERIOD

Bochicchio a journalism major said it was made even sweeter by simply being on the team last year and getting smoked just about every single game. he also said that they had a feeling the win would happen this season after their thrilling overtime match against MIT PERIOD

Coaches and players said one key reason for that win was the schedule leading up to the Coast Guard match PERIOD The team normally plays a Wednesday nonconference game and then goes on to tackle a NEWMAC rival on Saturday PERIOD Before Coast Guard however the Lions had the previous Wednesday off allowing them to prepare more and focus specifically on their opponents play PERIOD

Sophomore back Paul Bou Aziz a communication studies major said they took full advantage of the extra time PERIOD

We learned this year that we do better when we have a full weeks worth of training so maybe next yeardepending on the schedulewe can probably do more training with NEWMAC games he said PERIOD That definitely helped. mejia agrees and has already made next seasons schedule to adhere to this strategy PERIOD He moved many of the midweek matches to Monday rather than Wednesday so the team can have four days to prepare for a Saturday conference matchup instead of two PERIOD

Along with the adjustment to the schedule for next season the Lions are looking forward to new opportunities on the field after establishing a base for the team to grow upon PERIOD

We as a team are still building a name for ourselves so hopefully getting that first NEWMAC win puts our name on the map a little bit freshman back Creighton Dorfman said PERIOD I dont think theres any excuse for us anymore to say Oh were Emerson we lost again in the conference PERIOD I dont think its like that anymore. cancel reply
