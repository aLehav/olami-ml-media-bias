by  Emily GarberPublished  September  

He wants you to throw something at him in the middle of his show PERIOD He wants to be called an asshole while hes up on stage PERIOD And to show his appreciation hell throw you some jelly beans PERIOD

Calvin Johnson pulled these antics while on tour with The Microphones a few years ago PERIOD He taped notes under the seats in the audience for them to find during the show rewarding their participation in the end with a shower of candy PERIOD

This is how Calvin Johnson works PERIOD The man who started K Records and worked his way up to the status of Pacific Northwest indie god who takes up half the space on the cover of Becks album One Foot in the Grave whose record label emblem was supposedly tattooed on Kurt Cobains arm rolls into shows wearing pastel pink ankle socks PERIOD It doesnt seem to matter to him that his work helped spawn a new musical era  he just wants to twist and shout on stage PERIOD

Inevitably a conversation on the transformation of the punk scene from an elitist sect of abrasive musicians into an openended lifestyle will lead to two cities  Washington D.C. and Olympia Wash PERIOD

The former was rooted in the mostly Dischord records hardcore scene home to bands such as Minor Threat and Fugazi PERIOD Olympia a town of merely  is a lesslikely choice for being the epicenter of a punk rock revolution PERIOD But it is mostly thanks to the man of the hour PERIOD

Ks presence has affected the city very little Johnson modestly lies in his signature baritone voice PERIOD He chooses his words carefully hardly ever constructing a full sentence PERIOD Were just one of many. calvin Johnson started his work in the underground pop scene working with Olympia community radio station KAOSFM PERIOD He wrote for Sub Pop back before it became a label and was only a fanzine working closely with its founder Bruce Pavitt PERIOD Both Johnson and Pavitt wrote for Op an Olympiabased music magazine which focused on independent and artistowned labels PERIOD The two invented Sub Pops cassette fanzine a cheap and easy way to massproduce music which lead to the creation of K Records then a cassetteonly label PERIOD

Johnsons first band Beat Happening was one of the first cassette releases on K PERIOD It drew a lot of attention for playing light and poppy cuddlecore while contemporaries were stuck on heavy hardcore PERIOD

Since its inception K Records has signed many now wellknown bands such as Built to Spill and Modest Mouse PERIOD Now artists such as Kimya Dawson Little Wings and the All Girl Summer Fun Band call K home PERIOD

Currently Johnson fronts the funkfreestyle group Dub Narcotic Sound System named after his Dub Narcotic recording studio at the K Records headquarters PERIOD He came out with a solo album What Was Me in  getting mixed reviews from critics PERIOD

The album is  percent a cappella  which is a lot considering Johnson doesnt have what would be called a soothing voice PERIOD But he forges through it accompanied along the way by Mirah a former K artist who shows up on nearly every The MicrophonesMount Eerie album on the song Ode to St PERIOD Valentine. sub Pops slogan Were here to decentralize pop culture remains integral to Johnsons creative process PERIOD There simply is no set method to how Calvin Johnsons mind or business operates PERIOD

If there was a procedure it would be really boring PERIOD Theres a procedure for the military and look he said theyre really boring. in all K Records has created and maintained the doityourself mentality central to genuine indie rock PERIOD K Records and Calvin Johnson have aided in the creation of a gray area in punk music looking to sign the weirdos recording in their bedrooms he said rather than the band in the bar down the street. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
