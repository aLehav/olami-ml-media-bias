7229,2023-10-31,"the COVID19 pandemic has without a doubt rocked the entire Muhlenberg community and the world at large PERIOD All of Muhlenbergs spring studentathletes have been forced to sit on the sidelines left to imagine what their respective seasons could have brought PERIOD This may have been the year the Mules brought home several Centennial Conference titles PERIOD However they must endure the pain of not knowing and for Mulenbergs senior athletes this agony is the greatest PERIOD Since the news of Muhlenbergs sports cancellations officially broke on Mar PERIOD  though the studentathletes and athletic department as a whole remain active and in good spirits PERIOD

In a midMarch announcement Executive Director of the Centennial Conference Portia Hoeg stated Initially we were optimistic we could return to competition in a few weeks however the rapid growth and developing facts surrounding this pandemic now requires our league to do our part in protecting the health and wellbeing of our constituents PERIOD This decision was not reached lightly but ultimately this is what must be done. truly unprecedented in the world of athletics let alone Muhlenberg athletics the realness of this announcement sent waves throughout the campus PERIOD Ripping away perhaps the most crucial aspect of social life from the Muhlenberg community no one has been more impacted than the dedicated studentathletes themselves as well as the members of the athletic department who work tirelessly to ensure their success PERIOD

While ultimately unsurprising as conditions worsened around the country the news still hurt PERIOD Gabriella Crivelli  of womens lacrosse expressed this sentiment saying I was not entirely surprised by the decision but that did not mean that it was easy to deal with PERIOD There were definitely tears shed. as a senior this reaction was most certainly warranted PERIOD As Crivelli progressed through her athletic career this was definitely not the way she envisioned it potentially ending PERIOD

Sharing in Crivellis feelings is fellow lacrosse player Bobby McLoughlin  PERIOD For him too the decision was expected but when it finally came to life he was in utter shock PERIOD

While I wasnt surprised that the conference cancelled our season seeing the official post sent out by the conference was all too real and it was tough to wrap my mind around PERIOD It all happened so quickly making it confusing and honestly more disappointing he explained PERIOD

Though Sarah Raab  of Muhlenberg softball may not be a senior the news is still disappointing PERIOD Following the groups spring break trip to South Carolina Raab was extremely excited to continue the season PERIOD Its been hard on us for sure PERIOD We were really looking forward to this season as we only graduated three people last year on the softball team and we have a new coach PERIOD We felt really good coming back from Myrtle Beach ready for the Centennial Conference she said PERIOD

As every studentathlete suffers at the hands of the coronavirus few feel for them as much as Muhlenberg Athletic Director Lynn Tubman PERIOD

As it was all unfolding minutebyminute it was Tubman and her teams responsibility to do our best to be understanding and compassionate provide up to date communication on what was happening and to listen to concerns and provide feedback Tubman explained PERIOD

On Mar PERIOD  the athletics department convened to discuss meeting with their teams prior to leaving and it was on that final Mar PERIOD  date that Tubman had announced that the remainder of the spring seasons were to be cancelled PERIOD

My initial reaction was a combination of shock and disbelief. i had never seen anything like this in my lifetime PERIOD I was truly sad for our student athletes Tubman said PERIOD

As a former student athlete and coach and now as a college administrator and parent my heart ached for the students who lost the opportunity to compete in the NCAA wrestling championships as well as for all our spring sport student athletes especially our seniors whose seasons abruptly ended with little time to process what was happening before leaving campus she continued PERIOD

Still in those few days before leaving campus time was found to pay tribute to the senior class who are not going to receive the traditional senior send off PERIOD

It was nice that for our last game before the season got cancelled after we found out we were suspended indefinitely our coaches started all the seniors for what ended up being our last game said McLoughlin PERIOD

On the womens side Crivelli reminisced saying The day I left to return home the team held a Senior Day for the nine seniors PERIOD It wasnt the same as a normal Senior Day but it was nice of them to think of us PERIOD They decorated the locker room and gave us flowers which was so sweet of them. for Raab and the Mules on the diamond they too were able to have a little makeshift senior game as she called it and shed some light on the dark road ahead PERIOD

Even as the worldwide pandemic was closing in and tearing them away from the sports they loved Muhlenbergs studentathletes determination to each other has been remarkable PERIOD

As sad and unbelievable as the circumstances may be the athletes remain as one even if it has to be through alternative means PERIOD For them staying connected is no longer done in the weight room or in the gym but through video games Zoom sessions and GroupMe PERIOD

We have been playing video games with each other as well as frequently video chatting on Zoom McLoughlin explained PERIOD We have also all been checking on each other in our team group chat PERIOD While it has been difficult to stay positive we have been talking about taking a senior trip somewhere together when this is all over. both Raab and Crivelli also expressed that their teams were taking advantage of technological connections PERIOD We have been staying in touch through our group chats as well as Zoom sessions with the girls because its great to actually see everyone said Raab PERIOD

While structured gym sessions have been halted that has not stopped these athletes from staying fit and loose PERIOD Working out at home has been a good way to distance myself from all that we are facing PERIOD Ive been going for runs around the neighborhood as well as lifting the few weights that I have in my basement said McLoughlin PERIOD

Ive also been staying loose by playing basketball and lacrosse in my backyard he added PERIOD

Raab has also been finding all different ways to keep active PERIOD I have been running biking and doing athome workouts PERIOD Our team is coming up with new ways to stay active and work out with things around the house so its been fun to see what people can scrounge from their house to lift with said Raab PERIOD

Even though they all may be in different locations there are still fun and exciting ways to come together PERIOD

Tubman her department and the Centennial Conference like the studentathletes continue to work hard PERIOD Within the C.C. we have a formal meeting this week between the conference directors of athletics Tubman explained PERIOD Our conference vice presidents and presidents also meet and will be meeting in the coming weeks to discuss the impact of COVID19 on institutions and athletics departments. according to Tubman The biggest concern is the uncertainty around COVID19. everyone would like to know when we will return to campus and what that will look like but we just cant provide a definitive response yet she continued PERIOD

With sights set on the fall there are several preparatory steps being taken PERIOD The NCAA has formed a COVID19 Advisory Panel to help guide the NCAAs response to the pandemic and will make recommendations on issues such as summer workouts preseason practices and the start of the fall seasons Tubman detailed PERIOD

Although uncertainty currently plagues college athletics as a whole the men and women of Muhlenberg athletics have found ways to remain positive and connected through it all PERIOD The diligent efforts of Tubman and her staff as well as the passion of the athletes are exactly what characterize Muhlenbergs athletic community PERIOD
