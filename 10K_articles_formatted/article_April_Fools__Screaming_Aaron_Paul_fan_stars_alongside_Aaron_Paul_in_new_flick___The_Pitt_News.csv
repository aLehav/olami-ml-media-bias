Editors Note This is a satirical story PERIOD

When director Gabriele Muccino began filming his new movie Fathers and Daughters on the University of Pittsburghs campus he might have expected throngs of young fans to swarm the set PERIOD

But Muccino probably didnt expect to recast one of his young stars PERIOD

On Monday the director revealed that his film which once starred Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul Amanda Seyfried and Russell Crowe will be recasting the Seyfried role for Screaming Aaron Paul Fan PERIOD

He first noticed her while they were shooting last Thursday outside the Carnegie Library when tens of thousands of fans gathered across the street from the set PERIOD

After finishing a scene Paul invited the mob of fans to run over to him PERIOD The crowd sprinted jumped and howled for Paul PERIOD But one fan made a lasting impression on Muccino like no other PERIOD

When I first saw Screaming Aaron Paul Fan she just had this contagious energy Muccino said PERIOD You could tell she just wanted to stand next to Aaron and photograph herself all day long PERIOD Thats when I knew she was perfect for the role. the contagious energy that Muccino noted was most likely describing her continuous screaming from the moment she saw Paul PERIOD

Once Aaron Paul walked over to us Screaming Aaron Paul Fan began to scream for as long as her body would allow said Somber Russell Crowe Fan PERIOD She would sometimes break the shrill noise to utter a common Jesse Pinkman catchphrase like yeah btch Gatorade me btch or this is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed btch

But Screaming Aaron Paul Fan attributes her success to a whole other set of physical qualities PERIOD

Screaming Aaron Paul Fan said that she loved Aaron Paul so much that she told herself that she would kick punch body slam and generally manhandle at least  other girls to get close to him. area hospitals have estimated that  to about  fans have been hospitalized as a result of Screaming Aaron Paul Fan PERIOD

When asked about the fans volatile physicality Muccino was hesitant to express his concerns PERIOD

Shes a firecracker for sure but we have developed a new filming strategy where Aaron and Screaming Aaron Paul Fan will never share the screen with other actors Muccino said PERIOD

While extensive rewrites would normally be required for situations like this Muccino and screenwriter Brad Desch are taking a more improvisational approach to finishing the film PERIOD

Instead of changing entire scenes in which Aaron and Amandas characters would have interacted with other cast members weve decided to let Aaron try some more offthecuff dialogue with Screaming Aaron Paul Fan screaming responses of varying volume and timbre Muccino said PERIOD

He noted that the changes could result in some delays much like that other movie filmed in Pittsburgh PERIOD

Screaming Aaron Paul Fan is extremely excited for the opportunity to act alongside her favorite actor of all time but admits that the demanding schedule might impact her Breaking Bad binge schedule PERIOD

Im halfway into season two right now so Ive already seen that one bald politician guy get killed off PERIOD I still have a lot of the show left but at this point Im just waiting for the main character to lose his stupid southern accent she said PERIOD
