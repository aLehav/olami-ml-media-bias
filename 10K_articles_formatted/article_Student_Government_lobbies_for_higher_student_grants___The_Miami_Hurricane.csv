The Florida Resident Access Grant FRAG a scholarship given to all Florida residents who attend private universities was raised by  dollars last year PERIOD But that isnt enough for John Constantinide PERIOD

Constantinide speaker pro tempore of the Senate in Student Government said each state resident student attending a private university currently receives  to  per year PERIOD The money comes from the state of Florida and decisions on the FRAG are made by the state legislature PERIOD

The speaker is lobbying for the grant to increase to at least  per student per yearthe current FRAG amount is  PERIOD

The grant helps students in their educational pursuits and gives them more opportunities for their college degree Constantinide said PERIOD Some private universities attend to specific or special needs for students and the FRAG lets the students choose exactly where to attend school more easily PERIOD

People have this idea that attending a private university is some incredible thing but it shouldnt be he said PERIOD

Constantinide pointed out that the FRAG does not just benefit Florida residents but nonresidents as well PERIOD With more government money going to Florida residents the private universities will be able to open their checkbooks for nonresidents PERIOD

But even if the FRAG reaches  it should not be set in stone at that amount PERIOD Constantinide said the grant should be adjusted periodically for increases in tuition at universities increases in the cost of living and in inflation PERIOD

Gov PERIOD Jeb Bush supports the FRAG Constantinide said but it still has to compete with other programs including state university programs PERIOD Millions of dollars go to public universities in the state he said PERIOD

The state of Florida is giving private universities pennies compared to what theyre pumping into state colleges he added PERIOD

UM freshman Lennae Crawford said the FRAG encourages people to go to college who normally wouldnt PERIOD

A lot of people cant afford to go to college and the FRAG gives them more opportunities she said adding that the FRAG especially helps those who attend inexpensive universities PERIOD

The Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida ICUF lobbied for the FRAG to increase to  PERIOD In their  document Supercharge Floridas Economy ICUF argues that the grant educates minority urban and working students whose incomes are lower than students at public universities PERIOD

Constantinide who is also an appointed presidential fellow for ICUF said that not much has been done to promote the FRAG and some students do not know what it is PERIOD To fix that the Student Government cabinet will have several sessions in the UC Breezeway in the future PERIOD But that alone is not all that should be done Constantinide said PERIOD

UM should take a more active role in the office of admissions in promoting the FRAG he said PERIOD

There are two main things students should know about the FRAG said Constantinide PERIOD First they should know it is not just for Florida residents PERIOD Second if students want to keep the FRAG Constantinide urged that they should voice their support and write to their state representative or a newspaper PERIOD
