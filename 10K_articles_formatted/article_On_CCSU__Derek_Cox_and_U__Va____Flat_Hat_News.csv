8412,2023-11-05,"quick thoughts from the Tribes win over Central Connecticut State

This was one to forget

Overall theres really not a whole lot to say about this game PERIOD The College needed to come out with some semblance of energy which they did PERIOD Beyond that it was largely a clunker PERIOD

Senior QB R.J PERIOD Archer looked very solid apart from one boneheaded throw on the interception and it seems that this offense is capable of coming close to last years in terms of effectiveness PERIOD So far Archer has proven he can handle both a conservative game plan and one that requires him to make plays PERIOD The latter can be expected against Norfolk State Northeastern Rhode Island and Towson PERIOD In the tough matchups versus Delaware JMU New Hampshire and Richmond the task of winning the game will likely be given to the defense while the offense attempts to control the clock and not turn the ball over PERIOD

Regardless after two games three if you count Villanova last year I think Archer has put to rest any doubts as to his quality of play PERIOD If there were any doubts in the first place. the offensive line is a big question mark

The second half of Saturdays contest was largely given over to experimentation on the offensive side of the field for the Tribe PERIOD But the first half should worry anyone whos a fan of the College PERIOD The Tribe oline repeatedly failed to give Archer time in the pocket against what will be one of the weaker defensive fronts the College faces all year PERIOD

Archer did a great job of getting outside with his feet as he should against a NEC defense lacking great speed PERIOD But imagine what Richmonds defensive line is going to do against the Colleges front I think everyone vividly remembers that defense last year hounding Jake Phillips into four first half interceptions PERIOD

And thats not to say that the offensive line fared any better in the run game PERIOD The College racked up  yards on the ground but very little of that was through the middle of the field PERIOD Jonathan Grimes Terrence Riggins and Courtland Marriner found it tough going all night between the hash marks as the offensive line mostly failed to open up any space for them PERIOD For that problem and in protecting Archer Laycock is going to need a solution and quickly PERIOD

Which brings me to

Jonathan Grimes

As he reaches  yards for his career lets pause to reflect for a second on Grimes PERIOD From the moment I first saw him in the Colleges final preseason scrimmage of last year there was little doubt that Grimes was going to be a special back here PERIOD Now  games later hes become the fastest in Tribe history to reach  yards PERIOD His last few games have been tough but the guy simply does not go down on first contact and almost never loses yardage PERIOD Is it believable that the New Jersey native only got one scholarship offer coming out of high school Simply a great find for Laycock and his staff PERIOD Its one which will be paying off in a big way for the next several years PERIOD

Ryan Moody

Undoubtedly the toughest aspect of Saturdays win PERIOD Moody injured his ankle attempting to make a tackle on Archers third quarter interception and was down on the field for almost  minutes attended to by about  coaches and trainers PERIOD Sources on the sideline tell me the injury was horrific to look at and Laycock confirmed that it will require surgery PERIOD No official word yet but I would be shocked the see the redshirt freshman back this season PERIOD

Which is a shame considering that he was quickly becoming one of Archers favorite targets PERIOD After catching  balls for  yards against U.Va. moody looked strong again against CCSU before going down combining good hands with topend open field speed PERIOD It seemed like the redshirt freshman was going to become a key component of the receiving game but that will now have to be put on hold until next year PERIOD

Derek Cox

A quick congratulations to former College cornerback Derek Cox a third round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the April NFL draft PERIOD Derek started in his NFL debut Sunday lining up against Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts a tough opening assignment PERIOD He responded by making a goalline interception recovering a fumble and notching three tackles PERIOD Great debut for an excellent player and even better person PERIOD

Video here PERIOD
