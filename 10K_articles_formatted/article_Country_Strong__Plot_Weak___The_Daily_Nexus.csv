4161,2011-01-13,"i dont like country music PERIOD My musical tastes lie somewhere between gangsta rap and a littleknown genre called pirate metal so the honkytonk bar tones and sappy tongueincheek cowboy romance lyrics of country music arent really my bag PERIOD Bear that in mind when I tell you that the best part about Country Strong is the original soundtrack PERIOD

Country songs generally tell meaningful stories so I was surprised that Country Strong had such a weak one PERIOD It revolves around Kelly Canter Gwyneth Paltrow an alcoholic country star being taken out of rehab a month early by her managerhusband James Tim McGraw PERIOD This pisses off her secret boyfriend and aspiring country musician Beau Garrett Hedlund  complete with facial hair patchier than Tom Sawyers overalls who tries to keep her from going back to the bottle PERIOD Meanwhile a young country pop singer named Chiles Leighton Meester gets to go on tour with Kelly after her manager sees her sing on stage with Beau PERIOD The stress of being on tour so soon after rehab being stuck with a younger competitor the love triangle between her two male supporters and of course the alcoholism cause problems on and offstage for Kelly and crew PERIOD

My mother loves country music PERIOD She also loves watching movies where she can predict dialogue during dramatic pauses because she believes it validates her intelligence and makes her look cool when shes watching with other people PERIOD As sad as it is that I saw this movie alone I am at least glad that I didnt see it with her PERIOD She would have called the movie out on every single slice of melodramatic screenwriting rolling her eyes so much that it would make her as nauseous as I felt when I saw this film PERIOD The films predictability pauses only when the characters make unrealistic decisions and make blindingly obvious observations like The pills are only dangerous if she mixes them with alcohol

Kellys alcoholism is so bipolar that real alcoholics will watch this film and wonder how she got an off switch PERIOD Shell be fine one moment then crying and squirming and reaching for bottles that are surprisingly easy for her to get her hands on PERIOD Youd think that people working on tour with a recovering alcoholic would hide the booze a little better PERIOD Paltrow plays the wild unstable star with the charisma of a screaming toddler in a quiet restaurant PERIOD Her costars respond with varying levels of compassion PERIOD Her manager treats her like a burden which is ironic because he brings it on himself and insists to everyone watching the train wreck that everything is fine PERIOD Beau tries to take care of her but gets bored with her problems and frequently goes off to flirt with Chiles PERIOD Leighton Meester gives Chiles a charming Georgia peach personality making her and Beau the only interesting characters to watch in the film PERIOD

The films saving graces come during the onstage performances of Kelly Beau and Chiles PERIOD Shana Festes immersive direction in these scenes allows the viewer to understand the balls that it takes to perform in front of thousands in a stadium or even twenty drunks in a local bar PERIOD These scenes  backed up by the great country soundtrack  will certainly please any Alan Jackson and Shania Twain fans that just want to hear some good tunes PERIOD However they can search for these clips on YouTube and save themselves from the ridiculously overthetop offstage drama that these poor actors must play out PERIOD The music is country the performances are strong but the story just aint PERIOD Ill go back to my pirate metal now PERIOD

See your title PERIOD Its Weak not Week. ill have to remember not to send my kids and money to UCSB PERIOD

Id say your spelling is weak. thats weak not week. amother bright young scholar murders the English language on the taxpayers dime PERIOD

Another not amother. at least I catch my errors PERIOD

I really wish educated people could understand the type of work that goes into newspapers and realize the difference between a writer and an editor PERIOD The writers job is to write the story PERIOD The editors job is to put the story on the website with its title and formatting in place PERIOD Please at least try to know something about what you are insulting before taking it out on a writer who has no control over the story even being published let alone what title it ends up getting PERIOD

I dont buy it PERIOD  Ive written articles for newspapers and magazines and the title I suggested was always used PERIOD

Your blame the editor argument doesnt address the fact that budding young journalists SHOULD KNOW HOW TO SPELL whether they call themselves writers or editors PERIOD

This article is another testament to the quality of American higher education and the intellectually stimulating qualities of gangsta rap. good company on the road is the shortest cut PERIOD

Today while I was at work my sister stole my apple ipad and tested to see if it can survive a  foot drop just so she can be a youtube sensation PERIOD My apple ipad is now destroyed and she has  views PERIOD I know this is totally off topic but I had to share it with someone

Wow nice ideas though im not entirely certain i agree PERIOD
