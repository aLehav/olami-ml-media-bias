Is Hollywood Demonic

Richard Nixon  One of the Greatest Presidents Who Should Have Never Been Forced to Resign

Greene St PERIOD Pool Tavern is the New Addition to Milledgeville

The ghosts of Milledgeville

Way back in my day Disney Channel released some of the best and scariest episodes each year during what they called Monstober. with my expert knowledge of this topic I ranked the  most memorable Halloween episodes PERIOD However this list does not coincide with the ranking of my favorite shows from this era PERIOD



















 PERIOD The Suite Life of Zack  Cody The Ghost of Suite  Season  Episode  Watching this episode was the first time that I enjoyed being scared PERIOD In this episode the friends try to get revenge on Zack by telling him an exaggerated ghost story of a room in the hotel being haunted by a scorned woman PERIOD As the episode continues it is revealed that this ghost is actually real PERIOD What I love about this episode is that it does not hurt the reallife aspect of the show while also not explaining away the spooky haunting of the room by blaming it on pranks PERIOD All in all this is my favorite episode to get me in the Halloween spirit and I absolutely recommend that you watch it too PERIOD
