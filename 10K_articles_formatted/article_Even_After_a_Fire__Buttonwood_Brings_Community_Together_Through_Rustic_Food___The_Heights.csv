OKeefe said one of the restaurants biggest goals is to build community with the customers through its food PERIOD 

Our number one focus is getting to know our guests and create regulars said OKeefe PERIOD I think some restaurants just view it as maybe a transaction but were trying to create relationships and instill a sense of community. in  the restaurant experienced a damaging electrical fire PERIOD While no one was hurt the business was forced to shut down for  months as a result of the fire PERIOD OKeefe still remembers rushing down to the restaurant after getting the phone call informing him about the fire PERIOD

I was dropping my daughter off at school and got a call that the restaurant was on fire OKeefe said PERIOD I remember the fire department said we will be closed for two weeks and nobody could believe it PERIOD It ended up being  months to the day. buttonwood had only been open for four and a half months and was just finding its rhythm when the fire hit PERIOD The fire changed the sense of community both among the restaurants staff and within Newton as the staff members felt they lost everything they had worked so hard for PERIOD OKeefe had been working at Buttonwood for  straight days before the fire PERIOD

It was just kind of a bummer because we had really hit our stride right when the fire hit OKeefe said PERIOD We had some really positive reviews in the Globe and received proper Bostonian media coverage PERIOD We were really starting to find our footing and we were operating at a momentum that we didnt have when we first opened so we lost all that momentum. since then Buttonwood has been rebuilding by reorienting itself with the communityfirst philosophy it was founded on PERIOD Walking into the restaurant kind servers with smiling faces immediately greet customers PERIOD
