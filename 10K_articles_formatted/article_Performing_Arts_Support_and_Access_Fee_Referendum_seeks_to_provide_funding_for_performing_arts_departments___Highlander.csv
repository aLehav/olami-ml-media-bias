7839,2020-02-19,"on Wednesday Feb PERIOD  ASUCR approved the Performing Arts Support and Access PASA Fee Referendum to be voted on by the University of California Office of the President UCOP PERIOD In an interview with The Highlander ASUCR President Pro Tempore Miguel Ramirez stated that the referendum was the last resort to provide more funds to UCRs Departments of Music Dance and Theatre Film and Digital Production TFDP PERIOD

The referendum was created by the College of Humanities and Social Sciences CHASS Dean Milagros Pena Associate Dean for Arts and Humanities Kiril Tomoff and the CHASS Assistant Dean and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Cindy Williams PERIOD According to Tomoff most funding for TFDP comes from the CHASS Deans Office however those funds come from the Subsidized Student Admission Plan SSAP fee passed in  PERIOD Tomoff stated that the SSAP fee does not provide sufficient funding and is not sustaining the performing arts departments PERIOD The PASA referendum would replace the SSAP fee to give greater funds to these performing arts departments PERIOD

According to the referendum proposal a lack of funding among the departments of music dance and TFDP hinders the education of performing arts students PERIOD Ramirez stated Big performing arts schools like UCLA and UCSC they get most of their funding from alumni donations PERIOD Unfortunately UCR doesnt have a wide base of wealthy alumni who could donate. he pointed out the obvious issues in these departments such as a lack of classes and professors PERIOD

Brandon Honaker a fourthyear TFDP major said in an interview with The Highlander I have had a difficult experience in the major  The classes that I need are rarely offered and theres no professors that teach them and there are no seats in the classes. honaker described the difficulty of majoring in a field that does not have enough resources for all its students PERIOD He stated that he will be forced to take an extra year of college because he could not take all of his required classes which were full PERIOD Fourthyear TFDP major Sydney Swartz said in an interview with The Highlander Since our major has been growing exponentially each year we dont have enough resources to be able to teach every student about TFDP. ramirez said that these TFDP students need production units but they cannot acquire these units since the TFDP department does not have enough revenue to put up enough productions for students PERIOD This prevents students such as Honaker from graduating on time due to the struggle in getting the number of required units PERIOD Ramirez remarked A lot of my constituents and friends are students within these programs and theyve told me firsthand how much theyre struggling. he added Having more resources more money and more funding means having access to more productions  and hiring of more professors. ramirez said he plans to use tabling and social media to spread awareness and recruit students to make the referendum pass PERIOD Im planning to host an event that will be open for everyone and where Ill go through the referendum  Ideally Ill be attracting a lot of the visual arts majors stated Ramirez PERIOD

The referendum states that it would provide funding to the play productions concerts and other events that the performing arts departments host to fund their respective fields PERIOD Tomoff said that if the funding for TFDP does not increase TFDP cannot grow their productions to accommodate the rising student population and music instruments cannot be properly maintained repaired or replaced PERIOD The referendum fees will also give each department enough revenue to increase their production staff PERIOD Currently students must buy tickets to many dance events including all professional dance performances however the referendum would allow students to receive free tickets to these events PERIOD The PASA referendum would even enhance infrastructural support and improve planning for facultyled research conferences festivals and performances PERIOD

If the PASA referendum is passed it would require each student to pay . per quarter with  dollars funding the performing arts departments and . being allocated to financial aid PERIOD This would give the CHASS performing arts departments  per quarter PERIOD

Regarding the referendum Ramirez stated I think it will be an impactful solution that will help a lot of students. he said that after UCOP approves the referendum it will be voted by ASUCR as to whether it will be on the election ballot PERIOD He stated that if it is added to the ballot it will need  of students to vote for it in order to pass PERIOD

If the referendum is passed it will go into effect fall quarter of  PERIOD
