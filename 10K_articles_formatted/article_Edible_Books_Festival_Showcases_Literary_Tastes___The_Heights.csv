3665,2014-04-02,"the Boston College library staff isnt quick to give away the fact that theyre in truth a very rambunctious bunchtheyre librarians after all PERIOD As they do every year though with their Edible Books Festival turning food and words into artand clever punsthey remind us that they throw quite the little party PERIOD

GALLERY Edible Books Festival

Set near the stairs of the ONeill main lobby the  entries to this years contest were arrayed on two tables as a crowd shuffled back and forth PERIOD Each edible entry is some sly reference to a book or the written word itself PERIOD The Edible Books Festival is an exercise in curiosity and patience and most likely the shortestlived art exhibit on campus PERIOD The staff places the exhibits a little before noon and then staff and wayward students have a meager  minutes to inspect the entries PERIOD When the clock strikes  p.m. its on to the eatingthe time for appreciating art is over as vultures emerge from all corners of the library at the smell of free food PERIOD

There is one hour to appreciate art and about  minutes to get a tasty piece of each exhibit PERIOD One hour was more than enough time PERIOD The festival featured both endearingly simple arrangements and more elaborate ones PERIOD The same could be said of the puns like Kevin Tringales Animal Crackers Farm based off George Orwells classic Animal Farm PERIOD Tricia McMahons The Scarlet Letter was short a pun but the massive red velvet cake in the shape of an A more than made up for it PERIOD Some of the other simpler pieces included Sally Wises Bread Alone which was simply thata bowl of bread PERIOD Hannah Has Kindness Among Cakes from B.J PERIOD Novaks One More Thing usually inspired a chuckle PERIOD The piece featured a collection of generously portioned cupcakes with cheery flags PERIOD Another clever entry was Sherm Homams Betty Crockers Cooked Book. the exhibit was a cake imitation of an old copy of one of Betty Crockers cook books rips and all PERIOD It was chocolate on the inside PERIOD It made a lot of people happy PERIOD

The festival also included some more audacious exhibits PERIOD Este Popes The Dead Seaweed Scrolls was a nice contrast to the festivals overwhelming obsession with cakes though that may be an overarching societal obsession PERIOD Pope layered seaweed over sandpaper to create a tattered aged effect PERIOD Cindy Jones Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Chutney offered college students the chance to have chutney for the first time in a while and those that did may not think of chutney in the same way again PERIOD Jones let her pun do the talking with a simple arrangement of pita chips and bowls of chutney PERIOD Esther Griswolds Wrinkles in Thyme was another fine pun as a mini clock covered in ivylooking thyme PERIOD While technically edible the seasoned clock was more for show than eating PERIOD

The festivals organizer Scott Britton contributed four pieces to the collection PERIOD Two shied more toward the axis of art than food PERIOD His The Naked Apple and Rikki Tikki Taffy were two handsome entries but difficult to eat given that one was an apple with its skin shaved off and the latter a winding cobra made of taffy PERIOD They looked so good that the crowd was hesitant to destroy the exhibit PERIOD His other two however embraced the edible side of the festival PERIOD His Huckleberry Flan topped with blueberries lasted  minutes at most and his Shallots Web lasted longer only because the good people of BC cut out tiny portions PERIOD

What separates this event from all the other interesting art shows throughout the year is that the Edible Books Festival is fun PERIOD Art shows can be moving deep or inspiring but few feed you in the sense of actual food and sometimes college crowds are looking for a bit more than pure artistic nourishment PERIOD We can enjoy looking at an artistic piece but some part of us always wants to tear it down PERIOD Gingerbread houses arent meant to last PERIOD At the Edible Books Festival you can admire an exhibit called Donut Holes by the Educational Resource Center based on the classic Bones PERIOD You can admire it get an approving nod from a library staff member and begin stuffing your face with donut holes PERIOD
