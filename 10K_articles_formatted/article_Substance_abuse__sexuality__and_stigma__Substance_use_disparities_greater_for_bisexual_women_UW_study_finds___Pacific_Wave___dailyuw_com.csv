Updated November     pm



Until recently sexual minority health kept to the shadows of behavioral research PERIOD However earlier this year a UW social work professor published a  LGBTQIA health study PERIOD Based on their personal experiences UW students were not surprised to learn the study found health disparities between straightcisgender and LGBTQIA communities PERIOD

But these health disparities can also exist inside the LGBTQIA community PERIOD

Shedding more light on sexual minority health and behavior another more recent UW study explored the relationships between concurrent alcohol and tobacco use and sexual orientation in young women highlighting the influence of social context on substance use PERIOD

Funded by the National Institute of Justice Office of Justice Programs and U.S PERIOD Department of Justice the study issued surveys once a day to  participating students who identified as women over a period of  weeks PERIOD They reported their sexual orientation and concurrent alcohol and tobacco use as well as the social context of said use PERIOD

It should be noted that for the purposes of the study researchers defined concurrent use as use on the same day not at the same time and evaluated social contexts using three categories location e.g PERIOD home someone elses home bars restaurants social environment e.g PERIOD number of people attending number of people intoxicated and relationships to social environment e.g PERIOD friends family strangers alone PERIOD

 Jessica Blayney coauthor on the study said PERIOD

A social culture of drinking and drug use is nothing new to many UW students but the greater risks of substance use associated with sexual minority women SMW  those who identify as bisexual or lesbian  as found in the study may not be as common of knowledge PERIOD

According to the study SMW had more concurrent alcohol and tobacco use PERIOD For bisexual women especially alcoholuse days were associated with a greater number of cigarettes smoked and smoking days were associated with a greater number of drinks consumed PERIOD

Bisexual and lesbian women were more likely to drink with friends compared to heterosexual women PERIOD

The study also found that of the  of days involving solitary drinking across all women bisexual women reported more days drinking alone than heterosexual and lesbian women PERIOD It was also found that lesbian women drank more with partners than bisexual and heterosexual women PERIOD



Biphobia is a reality in so many worlds in the LGBTQ community in the straight communityI think that what gay and straight people might perceive as uncertainty in terms of sexual status ends up being leverage as a form of oppression against bi folks.In a lot of ways I think bi folks are forced into the closet just based off their communitys assumptions about who they are because they do identify as biWe know that sexual minorities have tended to socialize in bars and parties more often Blayney said PERIOD motivationsFor all of us we need to start to reckon with our biases around bisexuality around minority sexual identities and gender identitiesFor bi folks out there .. PERIOD the first thing to know is that youre not aloneLets Talk series PERIOD

The UW Counseling Center also offers many resources for UW students in either the LGBTQIA or straightcisgender community including students concerned about their mental health alcohol or tobacco use PERIOD
