Jason Coleman  Wednesday February  

Last weekend the first gold medal of the winter Olympics was awarded to Swiss ski jumper Simon Ammann PERIOD While his ability to propel himself off a ramp  meters into the air was incredible it was his post interview that was particularly telling PERIOD In it he spoke in incredible English to the NBC interviewer not only giving the normal it felt great sort of sentiments but also metaphors and idioms to describe his delight PERIOD I know quite well that Western Europeans in particular have famously gifted tongues often speaking three or more languages fluently PERIOD Some claim this is simply a result of necessity that European countries simply couldnt live together without its citizens able to communicate across languages PERIOD This is in part true however there still seems to be a sense of good European citizenship that involves learning another language if only to accommodate each other more easily PERIOD This is something that is certainly lacking in the United States with many students rarely even taking serious language classes in grade school middle school or college PERIOD

The common argument is that English is the language of the world should be the language of the world or soon will be the only language worth knowing in the world PERIOD So if we are fluent in English what else do we need Globalization has in fact made the world smaller and has increased the number of English speakers on the planet PERIOD However it is hard to imagine that English will be the only language worth knowing any time soon PERIOD Even with hundreds of years of continental coexistence the French still speak French and the Spaniards still speak Spanish PERIOD Education in the United States should work harder to imbue the sense of global citizenship that accompanies learning a foreign language.This seems to be lost on most major universities our own included PERIOD While the school of Arts and Letters and the school of Science require at least intermediate proficiency in one foreign language which is great the school of business requires no language courses at all PERIOD In fact it is possible to earn an International Business Certificate upon graduation without ever taking a language course or even leaving the country at all PERIOD

The majority puts forth the argument that English is the language of business and no other language is needed to be an international businessperson PERIOD It may be possible to operate internationally without any language experience but one will certainly be limited in their effectiveness PERIOD If the ultimate purpose of business is to sell a product or service to someone then one might ask how an American in Beijing plans to sell something to a Chinese business that operates mostly in Chinese PERIOD Moreover even if the actual business is handled in English it certainly doesnt hurt to demonstrate an understanding and appreciation of culture through language PERIOD Just being able to use simple greetings and talk about the challenge of learning a foreign language with someone who has had a similar experience learning English is good for business relations and as a result good for business PERIOD

In addition to making graduates more appealing to potential employers the simple act of learning a language is a different kind of challenge from working finance analyses or learning how to account for investments on the balance sheet PERIOD It is a challenge that cannot be mastered easily or with a long night of cramming PERIOD Make no mistake Mendoza students are top notch at what they do but in the same way they are rarely asked to produce a wellwritten essay they are not challenged linguistically either PERIOD Even if students never plan to work outside of the country the simple challenge of taking a language at a college level is enough to make them think more clearly about the way they use English in both writing and speaking PERIOD

Certainly some students would be upset at the prospect of having to take a foreign language PERIOD However it wouldnt be worse than other classes in the business school read future issues behavioral science requirements etc. and could potentially open up a whole slew of possibilities for a student that may have never existed PERIOD This has been the experience of a number of students I know who were able to turn some language ability into internships and jobs around the world PERIOD

Ultimately business schools across the country teach largely the same topics PERIOD If Mendoza is to remain a top notch business school it could start by helping to transform its students into not just a business force but a force ready to take on opportunities not just at home but all around the world PERIOD This would be a competitive edge that would be hard to beat PERIOD
