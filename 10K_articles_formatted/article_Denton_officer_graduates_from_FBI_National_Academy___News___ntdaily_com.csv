Denton Police Lt PERIOD Preston Pohler graduated from the 10week long FBI National Academy and is the seventh officer in Denton to have the opportunity with the last participant graduating back in September  PERIOD

The academy grants opportunities to further educate police officers from all around the world and is held in Quantico Virginia PERIOD Pohler has been working within DPD since  and is now serving as the recruitment and training division commander PERIOD

The FBI cant do everything without local law enforcement Pohler said PERIOD All this great training to local law enforcement builds bridges. pohler said he does not want to toot his own horn however he said he believes former DPD Police Chief Frank Dixon respected his work ethic and contributions and thought he would be a good representative for the national academy PERIOD

That type of training is geared to midtoupperlevel officers in the department said Steve Buchanan DPD assistant chief and university alumnus PERIOD Lt PERIOD Pohler has taken on numerous challenges throughout his career always stepped up to the plate whenever new things are asked of him PERIOD I think just his vast knowledge and experience set him up well to be a prime candidate. pohlers graduation from the FBI National Academy was announced Sept PERIOD  PERIOD He said the academy helped him remember why he got into law enforcement and why it was important PERIOD

Another good takeaway was the ability to have a close group of people to go to and ask if we have any challenges in Denton whether its community issues or trying to create a new program here Pohler said PERIOD I have people across the country and world PERIOD Getting the chance to be around people in similar positions around the country allowed me to pull different kinds of mindsets and their challenges. derek Bradford deputy chief for the Support Bureau said he hopes Pohlers experience will bring more knowledge to the police department PERIOD

Well I hope that it will allow us to have access to this network hes built Bradford said PERIOD Ultimately bringing back new skills and tactics new ideas and best practices and that will better serve our community PERIOD He will help keep our officers and our community safe and well PERIOD I would say hes hardworking dedicated a civil servant and highlight on the word servant he tends to do a lot for others before himself. immediate contacts are extremely valuable Pohler said PERIOD Within his current leadership position he believes now it is even more valuable PERIOD

In my early career I didnt really care or understand networking back then Pohler said PERIOD Another thing for me was that I was able to hear from all over the world what different programs and positions that other police academies do  that could be not just normal stuff like laws and procedures but health and wellness PERIOD Im looking forward to maybe implementing it here. pohler has a fresh outlook now and wishes to improve the way that officers are treated both physically and mentally Bradford said PERIOD

Hes very interested in assisting the department and reinvigorating our department Bradford said PERIOD We have a plan to meet to essentially catch up on all the ideas going down the pathways to see what we could bring into our culture how well seek out funding PERIOD If we can do it by all means lets try it. all of the services the FBI offers are free for local law enforcement use Pohler said PERIOD The participants were taught about the different assets and departments that the FBI houses in order to possibly supplement what the DPD does PERIOD

If theres some huge major incident in Denton we can call on them to help Pohler said PERIOD After I graduated theres a big alumni association  its over  law enforcement all national academy graduates PERIOD With that network if we have a need for anything really if we have a problem here in Denton if were struggling with it someone in that network has probably dealt with that same sort of thing. featured ImageCourtesy of Denton Police Department
