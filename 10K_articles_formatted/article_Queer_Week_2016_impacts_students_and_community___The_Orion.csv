On June    individuals were killed at Pulse a nightclub in Orlando Florida and the individuals that lost their lives that night are being honored across the nation PERIOD With Queer Week coinciding with this tragedy the GSEC decided to make the direct connection with Pulse by their theme We All Beat With One Pulse. margot van der Bie Queer Program Coordinator at the GSEC reflects on Queer Week as a positive experience saying We really wanted to allude a feeling of resiliency community unity and solidarity. the Multicultural Greek Council was also a collaborator for Queer Week with the second Annual Drag Show being put on by both organizations PERIOD Over  people were in attendance and the success of Queer Week had materialized PERIOD

This whole week has just been about building bridges and finding allyship van der Bie said PERIOD Folks to stand in solidarity with. another purpose of Queer Week is to help educate PERIOD It is meant to educate students and community members on the issues and discrimination that LGBTQ people face every day PERIOD

Rachel Ward Director of the GSEC and senior business finance and womens studies major had some personal takeaways at the conclusion of this week PERIOD

Just be mindful when youre meeting anybodyand to really not assume their sexuality or gender based on little things like their gender expression what theyre wearing how theyre talking Ward said PERIOD I think that its really important that we just dont rely on limited stereotypes and misrepresentation in the media. overall Queer Week  was a wild success PERIOD The wide arrangement of events from queer feminist speaker Michelle Tea and the Coming Out Party held at the UHUB from Chico State Pride and Housing along with others like the second Annual Drag Show and the Pride Party held at the GSEC shows student and community support and recognition of the marginalized group that makes up the LGBTQ community PERIOD
