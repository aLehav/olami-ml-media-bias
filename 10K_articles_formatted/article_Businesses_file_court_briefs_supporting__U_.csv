An outpouring of U.S PERIOD businesses many of them represented by global or national leaders have filed briefs with the U.S PERIOD Supreme Court in defense of the Universitys admissions policies indicating that diversity is an important consideration in the corporate sector PERIOD

Microsoft 3M and United Airlines are a few of about  businesses that joined more than  other national and military organizations by filing amicus or friend of the court briefs before yesterdays filing deadline PERIOD

The briefs were sent in response to the two lawsuits that challenge the use of race as a factor in the admissions policies of the Law School and College of Literature Science and the Arts PERIOD

The overarching argument presented in the briefs is education in a diverse setting prepares students to better handle the diverse nature of national and global business PERIOD

For students to realize their potential as leaders it is essential that they be educated in an environment where they are exposed to diverse people ideas perspectives and interactions a joint brief filed by  businesses says PERIOD

University spokeswoman Julie Peterson said the briefs help the court see a different kind of rationale about diversity in higher education than the University is able to bring forward. businesses seek to hire students from academic environments such as the University because they benefit from a diverse workforce and nonminority employees exposed to racial diversity said Dave DeBruin the legal representative for the joint brief PERIOD

Christine Edwards executive vice president and chief legal officer of Bank One said the institution signed onto the joint brief because it believes it is good business to have a diverse employee base to think about the needs of our consumer base. the brief argued educating students about racial and cultural differences is a compelling government interest because business is increasingly conducted on a global scale PERIOD

GM spokesman Edd Snyder said his company which filed a separate brief needs employees who are prepared to interact with business representatives across the world PERIOD

We make and sell vehicles across the world and we have to function with a variety of cultures a variety of races he said PERIOD You have to have people who understand these cultures and races. he added GM has a direct stake in the cases because they hire many University graduates PERIOD

The businesses which signed on to the joint brief  including CocaCola Reebok Kellogg General Electric and Pfizer  do not specifically address the Universitys admissions policies but instead defend raceconscious policies in general DeBruin said PERIOD

Despite the number and range of businesses represented in the briefs filed their arguments probably will not significantly influence the courts ruling University of Virginia law Prof PERIOD Kim FordeMazrui said PERIOD The court will mainly focus on the evidence and arguments presented by the opposing parties he said PERIOD

At the same time if the briefs present arguments not previously considered by the justices they can affect them almost at an intuitive and subconscious level he said PERIOD

Peterson said the total number of briefs filed for the cases may surpass the previous record of  but said the total is uncertain because she had not been notified of groups filing late last night PERIOD
