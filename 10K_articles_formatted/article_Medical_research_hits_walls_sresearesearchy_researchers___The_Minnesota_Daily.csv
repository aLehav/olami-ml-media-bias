5130,2023-11-04,"work that can show immediate benefits generally receives more federal funding PERIOD

by  Haley MadderomPublished  October  

Tay Netoff has spent about two decades researching epilepsy PERIOD Now the associate biomedical engineering professor has to shift his researchs focus to Parkinsons disease as its more likely to secure government funding PERIOD

The University of Minnesotas support from the National Institutes of Health  the worlds largest funder of medical research  has dropped by about  percent over the past five fiscal years PERIOD While many researchers like Netoff say theyre feeling the squeeze those whose work can show more immediate impact have been more successful at obtaining federal funding than others PERIOD

The NIH is homing in on research that promises to directly impact public health like studies that design and test drugs or explore ways to lower the cost of medication rather than work that answers basic questions with no immediate results PERIOD

Theres much much more pressure on NIH to show sort of shorterterm gains Netoff said PERIOD

His lab which began its research in  has yet to win a grant from the NIH PERIOD

Netoff said theres recently been a push for research that can easily translate from the lab to medical practice PERIOD

Though he has had to rethink his researchs focus in the interest of garnering funding Netoff said hes still doing a similar type of work which is based on improving deep brain stimulation techniques used to treatdiseases PERIOD

The Universitys College of Pharmacy has maintained stable funding from the NIH despite national trends said Esam ElFakahany the schools associate dean for research in an email PERIOD

ElFakahany said his school was able to secure NIH grants partially because pharmaceutical research tends to attract national funding agencies PERIOD

The NIHs budget for grants has declined by about onefifth in the past  years because the federal government hasnt adjusted the institutes budget for inflation said Tucker LeBien vice dean for research of the Medical School PERIOD

The grants are harder to get theyre more competitive and the amount that you can obtain has dropped LeBien said PERIOD

These financial constraints make it tough for risky research ideas to take off he said PERIOD

Breast cancer research isnt excluded from funding cuts either said Jason Weber an associate professor of medicine at WashingtonUniversity in St PERIOD Louis PERIOD

Weber said he had to drop preclinical trials on a new drug treatment for triplenegative breast cancer because his team couldnt financially support it PERIOD

The thing is the general public I dont even think is aware of whats happening to the funding situation he said PERIOD

Weber said Washington Universitys collaborative Siteman Cancer Center delves into both preclinical and clinically applicable research  giving it an edge in the eyes of funding agencies that are concentrating on public health effects rather than basic science PERIOD

Were not just asking questions to get the answers  were asking the m in a way that we can translate them into the clinic he said PERIOD As the dollars get tighter  Congress and the public seem to want to know what that money is being spent on. netoff said hes dedicating an increasing portion of his time to applying for grants PERIOD This year alone he said he will have spent about  to  weeks writing grant applications PERIOD

Nowadays you know people have to write a bunch of grants and  hope that one eventually hits he said PERIOD That takes away from your research. waning NIH funding is a problem that spans research universities and ultimately hurts young scientistsLeBien said PERIOD

There are students who may not have the opportunity to go into those laboratories he said PERIOD Its the reality that that environment is no longer where students are going to want to work because theres no resources. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
