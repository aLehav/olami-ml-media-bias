Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Jordan Lombardo and DeKalb residentJune  

For those of you who dont know the Yulin Dog Meat Festival which took place in Yulin China was a weeklong celebration of the Summer Solstice in which participants cooked up and consumed large amounts of dog meat  an event that was started only six years ago PERIOD

These dogs are not of a wild breed but rather they are dogs that would be considered pets and a member of the family PERIOD Many Americans and even the average Chinese citizen were appalled at this practice PERIOD

Words such as barbaric savage and cruel have been used to describe this event but the same could very well be said about our own cultures treatment of animals PERIOD

About  dogs were killed and eaten during the festival but that number pales in comparison to the . million turkeys that we killed and ate in  for Thanksgiving PERIOD The only difference between the two cultures is that we have designated certain animals such as cats and dogs to be more valuable than the ones we eat like cows chicken and pigs  most of whom are just as or even more intelligent than the cats and dogs PERIOD

If we recognize and condemn the Yulin Dog Meat Festival for its cruelty to dogs then we also have to accept the fact that our culture is even more cruel savage and barbaric to the animals we consume PERIOD We as consumers should be aware of where our food comes from and more importantly how its made no matter how horrible it may be PERIOD
