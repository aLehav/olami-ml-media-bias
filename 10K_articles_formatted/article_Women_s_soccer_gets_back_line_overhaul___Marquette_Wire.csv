3201,2023-11-04,"just  minutes into its opening round NCAA Tournament game last season the Marquette womens soccer team found itself in a huge hole PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Minnesota Golden Gophers jumped on top of the Golden Eagles with two early goals and Marquette was unable to recover PERIOD A few defensive collapses along with a seasonlong inability to capitalize on scoring chances sent Marquette home much earlier than expected PERIOD

Coach Markus Roeders is confident that his squad will learn from the NCAA loss and be a much better team because of it PERIOD

Were still looking for our consistency in our play and were trying a lot of different things and allowing different players to do different things Roeders said after his  victory over Rice Friday night PERIOD

The Golden Eagles defeated the Owls thanks to an early second half goal from the foot of sophomore forward Rachael Sloan PERIOD

It was really huge for us to get that goal Sloan said PERIOD We wanted to get a win our first night at home and this was a huge weight lifted off our shoulders. the Golden Eagles are off to a solid  start but are still working on improving from last year. goalkeeping and defending have been trademarks of the womens team in the past but finding the back of the net is something that must improve in order for Marquette to be a factor this year PERIOD Last season the team scored  goals in  games and was shutout seven times PERIOD

Weve talked about how we barely scored last year and we want to change that this year Sloan said PERIOD Weve been working a lot on shooting and possession so hopefully well get some more goals this year. another obstacle Roeders will have to work around is replacing his three seniors who provided a strong back line PERIOD Shannon Cusick and Katie Kelly were the main components of a defensive line that allowed only  goals in  games in  PERIOD Cusick and Kelly were first and second respectively on the team for minutes played totaling  minutes combined PERIOD Finding replacements for the two of them along with Kelli DeBarge who played a vital role coming off the bench will be no easy task PERIOD

Its going to be tough because its different without Katie and Shannon senior defender Katie Miller said PERIOD We have a freshman playing stopper and now Im playing sweeper for Shannon and we have different styles of play. while Marquette will miss the services of the three seniors it will benefit from an eightplayer recruiting class PERIOD
With this class there are some new roles that we have to define Roeders said about the freshmen PERIOD Ally Miller is the one thats contributing the most right now as a stopper but we have a few others that are sliding in and that takes a little bit of time. also new to the Golden Eagles is assistant coach Hideki Nakada PERIOD Nakada comes to the team from Idaho State where he was an assistant coach for the womens soccer team specializing as a goalkeeper coach PERIOD

Nakada has settled in very well Roeders said PERIOD Hes really enjoying it PERIOD He does some great coaching with our goalkeepers but hes involved with everything in the program. sloan added that although there are many new parts to the team the players are a collaborative unit working towards the same goal PERIOD

I think were just one big family she said PERIOD Were all really close and work well together and I think that makes a huge difference. the student news site of Marquette University
