UNC Asheville students said employment and academic success are directly correlated and can contribute to overall performance at work or school PERIOD

I started out as a student employee working as little as nine hours a week then I took advantage of the summer work program which allows you to stay on campus over the summer PERIOD Then I took a break semester and got a fulltime temporary job and now Im back in school working  hours a week said Aaron Mathey a senior at UNCA who works on campus as a housekeeper PERIOD

Mathey said oncampus jobs are more convenient for students who live oncampus PERIOD

Ive never known not working PERIOD Student jobs have been a huge stressor in my time at UNCA but luckily there are policies in place that keep you from getting overworked Mathey said PERIOD

He said it depends on the person and the job when it comes to worklife balance PERIOD

I know plenty of people who work in food service who have gotten so used to being overworked and being super stressed out at work all the time Mathey said PERIOD

He said jobs arent necessarily needed to maintain a happy healthy college career PERIOD

If you feel like it is not an option for you to not work I would say just go ahead and get a job PERIOD There are so many oncampus jobs that are so easy and if you dont like it quit Mathey said PERIOD

Ava Ingle is a senior at UNCA who works at Mellow Mushroom and lives offcampus PERIOD

I dont have any days where I dont have to go to work or school PERIOD I always have a day where I have to do something and thats hard for me because sometimes I like to do nothing all day Ingle said PERIOD

Ingle said its easier for students who live oncampus to work oncampus and students who live offcampus to work offcampus due to transportation and parking PERIOD

If youre looking for a job offcampus try to find somewhere close so you dont have to stress about traveling far to work PERIOD I usually dont have to leave my house until five minutes before I have to be at work which gives me time to do homework before work Ingle said PERIOD

Cate Marshall assistant director for experiential learning said working during college is a great way to be set up for postcollege life PERIOD

Some of the benefits of working on campus is they dont have to worry about the transportation piece Marshall said PERIOD I think for some people it is necessary to work but some people might not necessarily have to. on campus youre a student first and an employee second. marshall said there are multiple opportunities for careers during and post college PERIOD

Work with the Career Center to make sure a resume is updated and polished and a cover letter is ready to go Marshall said PERIOD
