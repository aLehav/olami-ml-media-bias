Bittersweet World  Ashlee Simpson

Rating 

Ashlee Simpsons third album Bittersweet World fails to sound bittersweet and instead just sounds well sweet PERIOD The 80s are alive and well throughout the album mixing electronica with repetitive twodimensional lyrics PERIOD

Outta My Head Ay Ya Ya sounds like a cheerleading squad joining forces with Ace of Base PERIOD Thank the music gods for the title or there wouldnt be much indication of what shes singing about PERIOD

Boys comes next along with a striking visual of Simpson skipping through a mall with a handful of shopping bags comes to mind PERIOD This album would make a great gift for a  or 15yearold cousin PERIOD Itll fit their musical maturity level yet it wont be heard blaring from any angstfilled bedroom doors in the giftgivers house PERIOD

If that track wasnt indicative of whom this album would best suit Rule Breaker is number three PERIOD Lyrics like I just wanna color outside the lines and Some say Im a black sheep  because I like to sleep late make one feel like Charles Manson PERIOD If thats breaking the rules then the world is seriously screwed PERIOD

The album fails to resonate with listeners of all ages PERIOD Simpson sings of wanting to stay true to herself  definitely a lifelong pursuit  yet falls short of writing strong lyrics PERIOD

Repetition and electronica worked in the 80s and people still enjoy the eras music for said reason PERIOD However Simpson is writing for todays audience and theyve heard it before PERIOD

The albums first single Little Miss Obsessive is reminiscent of Britney Spears early days PERIOD The pained yet innocent breakup anthem is always a sureshot with pop stars PERIOD Its the first song on the album that seems to have a purpose even if its a naive one PERIOD While it still exhibits the same poppy repetition as the rest of the album at least theres some variety PERIOD

The albums title track takes an unexpected dive into what sounds like jazz but the lyrics still lack passion PERIOD

The song like the rest of the album is too upbeat to reflect a bittersweet world PERIOD

Its uncertain what kind of world Simpsons singing about PERIOD If the world depicted in the album is truly bittersweet shes living somewhere between author Judy Blume and Doug. whatever it is it sounds like a cakewalk PERIOD
