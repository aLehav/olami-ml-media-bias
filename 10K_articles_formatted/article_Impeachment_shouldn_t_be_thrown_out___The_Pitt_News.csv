Youd never know it based on mainstream press coverage but Dennis Kucinich on June  Youd never know it based on mainstream press coverage but Dennis Kucinich on June  introduced articles of impeachment to the floor of Congress PERIOD Even though Democratic Party leaders would like to pretend this didnt happen its still a significant and needed motion PERIOD

Nancy Pelosi the Democratic Speaker of the House responded through her press secretary Pelosi believes that impeachment would create a divisive battle. a divisive battle between whom Democrats and Republicans As it stands now Congress has been unable to overcome the smallest of issues to pass legislation and nearly every bill must sludge through heavy opposition from either party PERIOD Pelosi makes it seem as though Congress has overcome the partisan stranglehold in Washington and an impeachment effort would be the tipping point back to old ways PERIOD

Besides her argument is completely irrelevant PERIOD Never before in U.S PERIOD history has there been an impeachment motion supported unanimously in Congress PERIOD

With presidential approval ratings at historic lows and reports that Republicans are expected to be demolished in the upcoming election why not move forward with the impeachment

Pelosi went on to call the impeachment a distraction from Congresss efforts to chart a new course for Americas working families and would ultimately fail. what a better course for American working families than one without a president who violates the Constitution and has ravished the economy

Somehow performing the duty of Congress to remove a president who has acted improperly is a distraction PERIOD

Hundreds of bills are presented in Congress that have little hope of being passed into law PERIOD Congress has even passed bills knowing the president will eventually veto them PERIOD Yet Pelosi feels that the impeachment will ultimately fail and is thus not worth pursuing PERIOD

In an era where everyone seems to be try to distance himself from the president what a better way to do it than support his impeachment Granted it is unlikely that the measure will ultimately pass but to not pursue it establishes a dangerous precedent PERIOD

Just  years ago President Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice PERIOD Clinton was accused of lying about his relationships with Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones PERIOD Kucinichs recent  articles for impeachment include the warrantless wiretapping program the constitutionality of the invasion of Iraq the extraordinary rendition practice and the commutation of Scooter Libby PERIOD

If none of the charges Kucinich has made against Bush are grounds for impeachment proceedings what does that mean for the future of the presidency

If impeachment is not pursued in earnest then it is implied that the president may act above the law PERIOD In this particular situation the president should be held accountable for actions that have resulted in the death of thousands of people as well as countless violations of the Constitution PERIOD

If lying about your sexual relationship is enough for partisan impeachment fanfare then shouldnt the same attention and scrutiny be paid to a president who is responsible for the most destructive war since Vietnam and blatant transgressions against the fundamental ideals that America is built on

According to a June  Rasmussen poll Bush has an unbelievably low approval rating of just  percent PERIOD Perhaps the Democratic leadership in Congress miscalculated how divisive it would be to remove the most unpopular president since Richard Nixon PERIOD

Its time for our representatives to actually represent public opinion and hold accountable a president who has broken our laws and made a mockery of the Founding Fathers experiment in a government accountable only to its citizens PERIOD The Supreme Courts decision on the rights of foreign detainees signals the return of the United States to its constitutional roots and an end of an era rife with shady if not illegal misdeeds and actions PERIOD

With or without media coverage the Democratic Party needs to step up to the plate and restore dignity and accountability to the White House PERIOD
