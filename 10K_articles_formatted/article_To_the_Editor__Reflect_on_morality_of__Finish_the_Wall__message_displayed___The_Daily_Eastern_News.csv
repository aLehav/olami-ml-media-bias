From Faculty and staff of World Languages and Cultures

Dear Editor

Yesterday at the Student Involvement Fair a Recognized Student Organization displayed a large sign at the entrance of the University Ballroom that read Trump Pence  Finish the Wall. the Latinx students faculty and staff whom we say we particularly want to recruit and retain entered the ballroom faced with an assault on their identities and family histories PERIOD

A recently hired immigrant staff member from Latin America remarked that she felt so intimidated that she quickly left the ballroom PERIOD She went out of her way to avoid walking in front of the two men at the table in order to evade their attention PERIOD She felt she needed to hide from them PERIOD

The faculty and staff of the Department of World Languages and Cultures strongly condemn the ideas on the RSOs sign PERIOD The sign contradicts both the values of the department composed of people with a variety of immigrant backgrounds and the mission of our university PERIOD

To the student members of this organization We challenge you to reflect on the morality of posting this message for fellow students to see PERIOD

To our Latinx students and colleagues and anyone who felt intimidated by the sign we say We see you PERIOD We value you PERIOD This is not us PERIOD You are us PERIOD

Sincerely

Kristin Routt professor of Spanish and Latin American Studies Carlos Amaya professor of Spanish Venesa Landrus professor of Spanish and coordinator of Latin American studies Leslie AshleyMcLean office manager for the department of philosophy and foreign languages Irene Jacobsen professor of Spanish Christiane EydtBeebe department chair of world languages and cultures and professor of German and Blair Watson professor of French PERIOD
