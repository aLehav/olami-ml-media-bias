On Sept PERIOD   the global rock icons of U2 changed the rock world forever PERIOD It was during Apples annual keynote presentation which most people were watching for the iPhone  reveal PERIOD Luckily everyone got a little something extra U2s brand new album released not on the iTunes store but straight to every iTunes customers library PERIOD Now thats instant gratification U2 frontman Bono laughed shaking Apple CEO Tim Cooks left hand PERIOD Songs of Innocence is a revolutionary album release the most groundbreaking musictoperson event in history PERIOD News outlets went wild one overly excited headline read Did U2 just outBeyonc Beyonc referring to her highly surprising highly successful iTunes Store album launch PERIOD

The answer is a firm definite No. i have nothing against U2 and I also have nothing for them PERIOD Theyre one of the most successful and wealthy bands of all time and even if you dont listen to them you probably know who they are though their relevance is starting to dwindle in Generation Y PERIOD Their brand of inoffensive stadiumready rock feels impersonal and quickly wears thin for my taste PERIOD I have no emotional connection to their work so anticipation for new music was nonexistent PERIOD

The problem with launching an album in the manner U2Apple did is that they assumed oneandahalf billion iTunes libraries giddily anticipated U2s new album and would happily receive it for free and be grateful for it PERIOD The album Bono proudly proclaimed at launch is a gift from Apple to all of their music customers. his train of thought is highly egotistical PERIOD Its also pointless in this musical age to gift music for free PERIOD If someone wants music for free theyll find it on Spotify theyll stream it from BandCamp theyll play a record uploaded to YouTube theyll gasp pirate it from torrenthosting sites PERIOD If you cannot or refuse to pay for music nothing will stop you from getting it PERIOD Free music is hardly a revolution PERIOD The albums release is however a revolutionary violation of consumer consent PERIOD The album infiltrated countless libraries PERIOD U2s perception of a gift is irrelevant if Davis Waste Removal hurled garbage at Aggie Pack as a promotion that would be far from OK even if the trash is a sincere gift PERIOD U2 fans were ecstatic to receive the gift while many were enraged at their violation of consent PERIOD I was confused and eager to find the proper place to throw this trash away PERIOD

But violation of privacy is not where the harm lies PERIOD Its easy to decide not to listen to an album and Apple released tech support that allows people to delete the digital record PERIOD But this album is far from a gift PERIOD U2 gave this album out for free not out of the kindness of their hearts but out of a  million between them Apple and Universal Music Group  along with a deal with retail stores to sell physical copies of a deluxe version according to an article written in Spin magazine PERIOD They were paid handsomely for a free album release unlike many musicians who have no choice but to start out their careers putting up their music for free on the internet PERIOD

Bono explained that the albums unusual release was motivated by a deep fear that the songs that they poured their life into over the last few years mightnt be heard. right PERIOD Because artists everywhere arent pouring their whole hearts and souls into meaningful personal sounds released for free or a few dollars they work their asses off for that will be forever eclipsed by bands who are paid millions of dollars to give out their music for free out of you know generosity PERIOD

Later Bono apologized PERIOD Its like we put a bottle of milk in peoples fridge that they werent asking for. lots of people are lactoseintolerant U2 PERIOD
