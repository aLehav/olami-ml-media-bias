Remember Me



Madison Square Garden was transformed into a 20000person dance party Saturday night as LCD Soundsystem played their final show PERIOD

The New York Citybased act has retired after nine years and three albums PERIOD The farewell performance was a nearly soldout event with at the bands request an audience dressed almost entirely in black and white PERIOD

The evening started with Liquid Liquid an underground dancerock band from the 80s and one of LCDs primary influences PERIOD

Were Liquid Liquid and this is Madison Square Garden said vocalist Salvatore Principato with bewilderment as he walked on stage PERIOD Even in its heyday the band never played for crowds much larger than a couple thousand PERIOD Their halfhour set ended with an extended version of Optimo the bands most wellknown song PERIOD



LCD Soundsystem took the stage  minutes later sans vocalist and mastermind James Murphy who strolled on stage separately and to massive applause PERIOD They opened with This is Happenings lead track and fan favorite Dance Yrself Clean. the songs sparse threeminute introduction gave way to the first big moment of the night as the mountainous synth entrance signaled flashing lights and an eruption of glow sticks from all sides of the arena PERIOD

The rest of the first act played out like a typical LCD show rockers Drunk Girls and Daft Punk is Playing at My House peppered with some deep cuts from their debut album and sophomore effort Sound of Silver PERIOD The penultimate song however contained one of the nights most poignant moments PERIOD

Murphy and company launched into one of their signature tunes All My Friends. the track an emotionally charged and constantly crescendoing retrospective tale of life as a traveling musician spurred a widespread realization of the finality of this performance PERIOD The crowd roared as Murphy sang To tell the truth this could be the last time a lyric that alludes to his constant struggles with keeping the project alive for as long as it was PERIOD

The first act came to a close with the Stoogesesque noisepunk of Tired the most aggressive song in the LCD catalogue PERIOD

The second act itself was one of the biggest surprises of the night PERIOD The crowd was treated to a performance of  a James Murphy composition commissioned by Nike and supposedly designed to be the perfect jogging accompaniment in its entirety PERIOD The 46minute mostly instrumental spacefunk freak out was accompanied by a chorus brass band  complete with astronaut suits  and appearances by Brooklynbased comedian Reggie Watts and LCD labelmate Shit Robot PERIOD

Watts humongous afro in hand only reinforced the decidedly funk sounds of 4533s first third as he soulfully wailed the vocals of its second movement PERIOD The band then transitioned into Sound of Silver which was brought new life by an entirely whiteclad chorus PERIOD
The rest of the second act was dominated by  and its brass compositions PERIOD Shit Robot appeared in costume to deliver the fifth movements narration from a spaceship located in one of the arenas empty sections and the act closed out with the Parliament and 80s synth pop sounds of bside Freak OutStarry Eyed. act three brought things back to reality starting with the effortlessly danceable Us V Them complete with giant discoball PERIOD

What followed was another of the nights biggest moments an appearance by several members of LCDs former tourmates and now Grammyaward winning superstars Arcade Fire PERIOD Win and Will Butler and Rgine Chassagne provided the wild screams for the chorus of a blistering North American Scum a wild rock tune about the treatment of Americans traveling in Europe PERIOD

The third act ended with the massive 10minute explosion of electronics and percussion of Yeah a staple of LCDs live shows PERIOD

The final act began with Someone Great followed by Losing My Edge two of Murphys most personal songs PERIOD The latter happens to be the first song ever released by the project and this its final performance hit hard with snippets of other songs thrown into the mix as their respective artists were namechecked the iconic synth line of Daft Punks Da Funk being a highlight of the entire evening PERIOD
It closed out with a touching version of This is Happenings closer Home accompanied by footage sent in by LCD fans from around the world PERIOD

Its been a long show Murphy said as he reentered for the final encore PERIOD Thanks for putting up with us. the announcement that the bands final song was coming up was met with boos and disappointment from the crowd PERIOD Hey Murphy responded I dont want to hear aw and oh no PERIOD This is our last song

Murphy was addressing what this performance meant all along PERIOD Prior to the show banners throughout the arena read RIP LCD. this was a funeral PERIOD

But a funeral is not only an opportunity to mourn PERIOD It is also an opportunity to remember and celebrate a life PERIOD This is what Murphy had in mind PERIOD

What followed was a gutwrenching performance of perennially perfect closer New York I Love You but Youre Bringing Me Down. an emotional Murphy needed to take a moment during the first few lines PERIOD A false ending powerful reprise and a balloon drop later and it was over PERIOD Murphy waved bowed and embraced his bandmates and friends PERIOD

LCD Soundsystem did something quite special that night PERIOD Their show is not meant for  seat arenas PERIOD They are and always have been a club band concerned first and foremost with getting bodies moving on the dance floor but faced with the largest crowd they will ever see Murphy and company transformed a boxing arena into a dance hall and conducted an impossibly intimate farewell PERIOD
