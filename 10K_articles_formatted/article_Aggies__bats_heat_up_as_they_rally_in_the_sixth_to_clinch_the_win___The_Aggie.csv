The Aggies looked like they were heading for yet another defeat PERIOD They were down  heading into the top of the sixth PERIOD UC Davis has not fared well with its back against the wall this season PERIOD However the batting order woke up and delivered some much needed runs to gain the lead PERIOD Once the sixth inning was over the score stood at  in the Aggies favor PERIOD

The relief pitching also managed to pitch four shutout innings to finish off the game against a Nevada team that scored all seven of their runs in the first five innings PERIOD

The Aggies rally started when junior shortstop Adam Young singled to third base PERIOD This was followed by a single to left field by sophomore right fielder John Williams PERIOD The Wolfpack pitchers then proceeded to load the bases and walk a run home with two consecutive walks PERIOD Eventually with the bases loaded junior Steven Patterson hit a twoRBI single which opened the floodgates PERIOD

The awful Nevada relief pitching allowed an enormous sixth inning rally as six runs were scored allowing the Aggies to pull in front  PERIOD From there the UC Davis pitching staff had sufficient run support to close the game out PERIOD The duo of freshman relief pitchers Spencer Henderson and Max Cordy pitched four shutout innings to ice the game for the Aggies giving up only four hits between the two of them PERIOD Cordy ended up with his fifth save of the season as he pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth innings PERIOD

UC Davis now improves its record to  on the season while dropping the Wolfpacks record to  PERIOD The Aggies now enter a three game series with UC Riverside PERIOD UC Davis hopes to jumpstart its conference record of  against the Highlanders PERIOD
