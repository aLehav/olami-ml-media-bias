While Washington and its allies have sought the dismantling of North Koreas nuclear programs yesterdays proposal from Pyongyang offered only to freeze them as a first step PERIOD The North added however that the longterm goal is to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. the goal of the United States is not for a freeze of the nuclear program Bush said PERIOD The goal is to dismantle a nuclear weapons program in a verifiable and irreversible way. that he said is the clear message we are sending to the North Koreans. the president spoke at a brief news conference with Premier Wen Jiabao of China who visited Bush at the White House PERIOD The Chinese are working to revive stalled talks between North Korea and the United States South Korea Japan Russia and China after a fivemonth pause PERIOD

Under its initial proposal North Korea would declare its willingness to give up nuclear development allow nuclear inspections give up missiles exports and finally dismantle its nuclear weapons facilities PERIOD In return it demanded economic and humanitarian aid security assurances diplomatic ties and new power plants PERIOD
Pyongyang had wanted Washington to issue the security assurances simultaneously with a renunciation of its nuclear weapons program PERIOD The United States wanted the North to move first PERIOD
On yesterday North Korea seemed to back away from its previous demand that Washington and its allies accept its package deal at one time PERIOD It demanded that at least the firstphase action be agreed upon PERIOD
