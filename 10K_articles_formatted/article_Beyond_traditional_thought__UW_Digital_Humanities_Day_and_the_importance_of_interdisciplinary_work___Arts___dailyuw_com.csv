What can you do with a liberal arts degree Almost every person in the humanities has had doubts about where their major will lead them in the future PERIOD Going home for the holidays comes with endless questions about why you chose your major and what you hope to do in the coming years PERIOD

Digital Humanities Day hosted Feb PERIOD  sought to answer these questions and others concerning the necessity of the humanities and the vital intersections between the liberal arts and technology PERIOD This event led by international studies major and Mary Gates Research scholar Yogasai Gazula invited panelists and attendees to reflect on the importance of the humanities in broader society PERIOD

Theres still a lot of misconceptions about the liberal arts and the value that they offer vocationally Gazula said PERIOD So they usually get dismissed as  not really offering valuable careers. through her involvement in undergraduate research Gazula discovered the many ways in which humanities research often coincides with technology and computational studies PERIOD

The field of digital humanities itself kind of refers to the use of nontraditional methods and humanities research and the use of humanities methods in other fields Gazula said PERIOD So I think as society evolves and technology evolves the digital humanities continues to evolve with it and it really will push us to think about how we can have meaningful interaction and contribution from different fields that are usually thought of as being totally separate and unrelated. on many of the panels professionals and researchers in the digital humanities discussed the relevance of the interdisciplinary field and the value that understanding humanities can have in vocational prospects PERIOD Many of these panelists had ties to UW digital humanities projects including the Baki and Svoboda projects led by the Near Eastern studies department PERIOD These tools utilize technology to transcribe important texts into a more accessible digital format PERIOD

The interdisciplinary approach of humanities concentrations also allows students to see the world from a broader perspective PERIOD Panelist Matthew Howard a Ph.D PERIOD candidate in English language and literature with a focus in social mobility highlighted the importance of this broad perspective PERIOD

I think its really easy for a lot of us to sort of be caught up in like a field the glitz and glamour of Im going to make a lot of money doing this Im going to be influencing change and then you get a very narrowminded approach to attacking problems Howard said PERIOD And with the humanities you have to kind of always pull back and get the proper perspective. another panelist Anne Melton a research associate at the University of Puget Sound has used her humanities background to research and track funding sources as well as assist with nonprofit management PERIOD She recommends that students who are still trying to find their way in the humanities and struggling to see how their education will help them in the future try as many opportunities as they can PERIOD

Theres definitely merit and benefit to just trying a little bit of everything  through professional opportunities but also volunteering Melton said PERIOD Just to ask Do I really like this It sounds good but in practice is it something I really want to do

The event encouraged people to look outside the box that is constructed around the humanities PERIOD

When you are trained as a generalist like in history or sociology or literature theres so many opportunities for you Melton said PERIOD And I think it kind of goes back to that you are then able to take this huge amount of information and condense it down into a digestible format. as technology develops these forms of interdisciplinary study and investigations into digitizing archives or utilizing quantitative analysis in traditionally qualitative fields will open more doors for students and highlight the fascinating intersections of a variety of fields PERIOD

The humanities are not a monolith and this event revealed the various paths and nonlinear experiences of those studying and forging career paths in the humanities PERIOD

I really wanted to challenge the notion of the humanities being this really static field where youre kind of stuck in a library looking at print materials Howard said PERIOD Hearing that you could kind of have intersections between the humanities and tech was really interesting to me  so many of those different fields could have overlays with ethics or morality  things that could really have an impact on industries moving forward. reach contributing writer Megan Matti at artsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter meganmatti
