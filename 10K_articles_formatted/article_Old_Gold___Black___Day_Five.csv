April  

Day five of the murder innocence hearing of the WinstonSalem Five finished with the testimonies of defendant Jermal Tolliver and key witness in the original trial Jessicah Black  an alleged accomplice of the teenagers on the night of Nathaniel Jones murder PERIOD

Julie Boyer the attorney representing Nathaniel Cauthen questioned Black PERIOD Black  was  at the time of the murder PERIOD Black remembers telling police officers during their interrogation of her what she was doing on Nov PERIOD  however they would counteract each of her statements with accusations that she was lying PERIOD She also said that the police threatened her by saying they could put her in prison or convict her of murder at any time PERIOD She said she eventually just started telling them what they wanted to hear so she could go home PERIOD

She testified at the  and  trials with the statement she gave police but has since recanted that testimony PERIOD Now she has an entirely different story of that night than what she told police back in  PERIOD This account she says is the truth PERIOD

Black was aware that she was putting herself at risk of perjury for recanting her statement and testifying in the hearing but when asked by Boyer why she was here she answered to get the truth out. on the night Jones died Black says she picked up the teenagers from their neighborhood to just drive around  an activity they did frequently after school in the early afternoon often while smoking marijuana PERIOD Black said they spent the rest of the day together PERIOD

While her memory is hazy on who exactly was hanging out together that night she says at least some combination of the four defendants were there PERIOD She is confident that Cauthen was present as the two of them were especially close and spent the most time together PERIOD

Black is also unsure of the exact timeline of that night in terms of where they stopped and when PERIOD

One of the stops they made was at Hanes Mall PERIOD She said that she and the boys split up when they arrived at the mall PERIOD She went to visit a friend who worked at one of the stores and the boys went off to do their own thing PERIOD

Black and the boys also stopped at Creekside Lanes Bowling Center PERIOD Black said they werent there for long because they left after one of the boys got into a verbal altercation with a police officer PERIOD

After leaving the bowling alley Black testified that she returned to Moravia Street to take the boys home PERIOD Upon arrival she said they saw several police cars and yellow crime scene tape surrounding Jones home PERIOD She added that they got out of the car to figure out what had happened and then they all returned home PERIOD

Within the next few days police officers came to Blacks home to confiscate her car as evidence and then she was also brought into the police department for questioning PERIOD

Black described her interrogation as her guessing about the details of different aspects of the crime like what object the boys hit Jones with or what color tape they used to bind Jones PERIOD

I finally got it right Black said in reference to the story police finally accepted before releasing her PERIOD

Black said she had never been questioned by the police before and was unsure of her rights PERIOD While she said she was never threatened with the death penalty she also said that the police did tell her that she could go to jail for life and could be convicted of murder at any point in time PERIOD She testified that the police never asked her if she would like her parents present or read her Miranda rights to her PERIOD Black said that she stayed in the interrogation room the entire time she was at the police department and was not aware she could leave PERIOD

Black became emotional on the stand as the defense recalled what she had told police in  and what she had said under oath at the trials PERIOD It wasnt until the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission hearing that Black realized that the Air Force  shoe print and what she admits was a false testimony were the only pieces of damning evidence the prosecution had against the defendants PERIOD The discrepancies between what the police told her and the actual evidence of the case have only just been revealed to her in the past two years PERIOD

You think about stuff like that Black said through her tears PERIOD It weighs on your mind and it weighs on your heart. the defense also questioned Black on her interactions with Hunter Atkins  a sports reporter for the Houston Chronicle who conducted interviews with Black and ultimately led her to recant PERIOD

Atkins persistently tried to contact Black for a couple of years PERIOD Black said that after Atkins explained the angle of his story  that he was trying to put a positive light on a tragic situation  she finally agreed to meet with him PERIOD

Black testified that They met for the first time at an IHOP in WinstonSalem and Atkins informed her of facts of the case that she didnt know PERIOD Black said that after Atkins revealed to her how she had been deceived she told him that everything she had said to the police and under oath was false PERIOD

Black also touched on aspects of her relationship with Atkins that have raised concerns such as allegations of him bribing her PERIOD Black testified that Atkins never bribed her to make a certain statement or change her story PERIOD

A couple of years ago when Black had lost her job and home and was living out of her car Black said Atkins paid her car payment but that it was after she had recanted her testimony to him PERIOD

He just helped to help Black said during the hearing PERIOD

Black said the two have not been in contact since PERIOD

In their crossexamination the Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Martin inquired about inconsistencies in what Black had just testified and her earlier testimonies at the Innocence Inquiry Commission hearings PERIOD

At the hearing Friday Black said she smoked marijuana as a teenager but did not experiment with cocaine until she was  years old PERIOD She had told a commissioner with the Innocence Inquiry Commission that she was  years old PERIOD

Another detail Martin inquired about was which store in Hanes Mall Black said her friend worked at PERIOD On Friday Black said she visited her friend at Hot Topic however Martin pointed out that there was no Hot Topic at Hanes Mall in  PERIOD Black persisted that whether or not it was Hot Topic that her friend worked at she did go visit her friend PERIOD

Martin also asked Black about her claim that she wasnt in Belview Park on the night of the murder PERIOD Cauthen had previously testified that he and Black had oral sex in Belview Park PERIOD Black said she had performed oral sex on him but not on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

The state was not able to finish their crossexamination of Black before the court adjourned at  p.m PERIOD on Friday PERIOD

Day five also included the state finishing their crossexamination of Tolliver that they began the previous day PERIOD Assistant District Attorney James Dornfried questioned Tolliver mainly on the events on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Dornfried pointed out that Tolliver never implicated himself in statements he made to police as he only made statements about what the other teenagers did that night and only described himself as the lookout PERIOD

Throughout his testimony Tolliver expressed his frustration at the fact that his testimony to police in  does not match what he says to be true now PERIOD

That doesnt mean it was true Tolliver repeated in response to Dornfried as he quoted Tollivers statement to police in  PERIOD

The hearing will continue next week and Black is expected to still be on the stand PERIOD The other three defendants are also expected to testify PERIOD
