Nolan McLean made an immediate impact in his first appearance in nearly five weeks PERIOD

OSU jumped out to an early lead and held on for a  seriesopening win against East Tennessee State at OBrate Stadium on Friday night PERIOD

The Cowboy offense took the lead in the second inning with an RBIdouble from Nolan McLean who is coming back from injury and played his first game since April  PERIOD In the following inning second baseman Roc Riggio went deep for his teamleading sixteenth home run of the season PERIOD

OSU coach Josh Holliday emphasized the importance of capturing an early lead highlighting the value it provided to his teams performance PERIOD

Scoring first is always good its always got a momentum component to it Holliday said PERIOD Home runs are great but team offense is just as fun because it requires multiple guys to do something good to score PERIOD Home runs are great because they happen fast thats awesome. eTSU starting pitcher Colby Stuart struck out the side swinging after walking the leadoff man PERIOD The Buccaneerskept it close as they went into the eighth facing only a tworundeficit PERIOD

OSU starting pitcher Juaron WattsBrown held the Buccaneershitless until the fifth inning and did enough to get the win PERIOD Through his five innings of work he struck out four while walking five and allowing just two runs off one hit  both coming in his final inning PERIOD

Juaron was really good for four innings and then the fifth inning there had a grip issue just the humidity and lost the feel for the ball for a couple of hitters Holliday said PERIOD He managed himself well probably more walks than you would have liked but you know its a solid start PERIOD

It was a tough ball game PERIOD I expect the whole series to be tough. the Cowboys  entered the bottom of the eighth in need of insurance runs PERIOD

After a leadoff triple from third baseman Tyler Wulfert David Mendham stepped up to the plate and sent a ball deep to leftcenter field and over the wall to put the Cowboys up  heading into the ninth PERIOD

Reliever IsaacStebens was left in the game after a quick eighth inning to shut things down for the Cowboys PERIOD

The Buccaneers  garnered an RBIsingle to pull within three runs PERIOD However a gameending double play was made after ETSU pinch hitter Jackson Green grounded the ball sharply to the shortstop PERIOD

Very pleased with the win faced a couple of good pitchers Holliday said PERIOD And we did enough scoring late obviously was big and it was a good team win. sports.edocolly.com
