Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Vittorio CarliOctober  

Heroes Stand Alone is a hopelessly banal and utterly forgettable war film PERIOD It panders to its audience by depicting American soldiers as wellmeaning and noble while all the Cubans are portrayed as being treachorous killers PERIOD

The story concerns an American reconnaissance mission PERIOD A group of courageous soldiers is sent to San Pedro to rescue the survivors of a plane crash PERIOD The enemy forces comprised of Cuban and Soviet military personnel violate a ceasefire in order to ambush the Americans PERIOD

The lead role is played by Chad Everett best known for his work on the TV show Medical Center. he plays Zack a jaded and tough platoon leader who questions the neccessity of his countrys involvement in the conflict PERIOD

At one point he tells one of his men that Its all for nothing. later we learn that the only reason the United States is involved is to get control of the countrys oil supply PERIOD

All of the attempts at humor fall flat PERIOD An American soldier named Willie wears a gaudy pair of red gym shoes on the battlefield PERIOD When Zack questions him about them Willie replies These are my ruby slippers. the film continues its Wizard of Oz motif when Willie laments Theres no place like home. i had hoped that the story would pick up when a lovely Cuban woman was introduced PERIOD At this point the film could have explored the theme of a woman in a traditional male world PERIOD Instead it completely squandered the character PERIOD The female character is treated as a mere sex object to provide titillation for the predominantly male audience PERIOD In her big scene she takes a bath in the river while her voyeuristic commander watches PERIOD

There is only one scene that packs any kind of emotional power PERIOD It occurs after a young soldier gets trigger happy and kills one of his fellow soldiers PERIOD Zack takes away his weapon and asks him how such an inexperienced soldier came to be on the mission PERIOD He tells Zack that he accidently killed a gook general and the authorities needed a hero that week PERIOD At this point Zack shows some compassion and gives the youth his gun again PERIOD

Heroes Last Stand features a double for Zack who gives orders to the other side PERIOD He encountered Zack on a previous mission and has respect for his opponents integrity PERIOD At one point he tells his allies how Zack carried a wounded guerilla for ten miles in order to save his life PERIOD

This commander is the only villain who has any redeeming qualities PERIOD The whole film seems to head toward a confrontation between these two characters PERIOD The confrontation turns out to be completely anticlimatic PERIOD Its a disappointing end to a disappointing film PERIOD
