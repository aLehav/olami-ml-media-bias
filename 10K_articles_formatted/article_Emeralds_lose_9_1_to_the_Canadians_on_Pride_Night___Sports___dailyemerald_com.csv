A choir sings pregame as the Emeralds take on the Vancouver Canadians while celebrating Pride Night PERIOD

With rainbowcolored bases players wearing rainbowthemed jerseys and rainbow flags handed out to fans the Eugene Emeralds celebrated Pride Night on Friday PERIOD

Spirits were also high at the ballpark because before the game the Emeralds announced that they will be returning to full capacity in July with no more masks or COVID19 restrictions PERIOD It was a night of pride and celebration at PK Park despite the 90degree temperature PERIOD

However the Emeralds werent able to come up with a win to back all that up PERIOD They lost their second in a row  after winning eight straight PERIOD Aaron Phillips turned in a decent start but missed opportunities haunted the offense and reliever Jasier Herrera struggled PERIOD

Just like that the Emeralds find themselves leading the HighA West by just a halfgame in a close race with the Everett AquaSox PERIOD The series is tied  after the Emeralds initially went up  PERIOD

After the first four Emeralds struck out Logan Wyatt drew a walk to extend his onbase streak to  PERIOD He was caught trying to steal second but the next two batters also drew walks which has been a recurring problem this year for Vancouver starter Luis Quinones PERIOD Tyler Flores hit one to the back of the warning track in right field but it was caught up against the wall PERIOD

The Canadians struck first with a twoout RBI single against Phillips in the third inning to take a  lead PERIOD

Catcher Brandon Martorano got plunked in the helmet to lead off the bottom of the third PERIOD He collapsed to the ground in pain and while he got up fairly quickly he had to be taken out of the game PERIOD Robert Emery pinch ran for him and replaced him behind the plate PERIOD

In the fourth Phillips allowed a walk and a tworun homer that extended the Canadians lead to  while the Emeralds still didnt have a hit PERIOD

The Emeralds top three hitters all struck out in the third exactly as they did in the first PERIOD

With runners on the corners in the fourth Franklin Labour hit one to dead center that just stayed in the ballpark PERIOD He settled for a sacrifice fly that got the Emeralds on the board and made it  PERIOD

Manager Dennis Pelfrey boldly kept Phillips in for the seventh inning PERIOD He walked the first batter and was pulled after a oneout double made it  PERIOD Herrera came in and allowed a walk and a single that brought in a fifth run which was charged to Phillips PERIOD

A single and a walk got the Emeralds in business in the seventh PERIOD But with the two runners in scoring position Sean Roby struck out to end the inning his fourth strikeout in as many atbats PERIOD On the bright side for Roby he showed off a strong arm at third base on multiple occasions throughout the night PERIOD

Herrera appeared to be navigating through a clean eighth inning retiring the first two PERIOD But after a walk and a single he gave up a threerun homer to center field that broke it open  PERIOD

With an eighthinning walk Wyatt got on base three out of four times to shoot his OBP over . one of the only bright spots for the Emeralds on a rough night PERIOD

Herrera took one for the team staying out for the ninth even after his rough seventh and eighth PERIOD With two outs he gave up an RBI double to the wall that brought in another run PERIOD

Emery recorded his second single of the night in the ninth but the Emeralds couldnt get anything more going as they lost  PERIOD

With the loss the Emeralds lose their second in a row with the series now even at  PERIOD And with the AquaSox winning the Emeralds lead in the HighA West falls to just a halfgame PERIOD

Theyll look to bounce back and retake the series lead on Saturday at  p.m PERIOD
