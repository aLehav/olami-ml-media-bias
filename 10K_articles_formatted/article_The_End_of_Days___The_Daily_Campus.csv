8334,2023-10-25,"the world may finally be coming to an end PERIOD After a good run of about four and a half billion years it wont be AIDS it couldnt have been a meteor crash and it wasnt even due to the Bush Library PERIOD

No the end of time sunshine and walks in the park will fall squarely on the shoulders of some little North Korean punk whose birthday seems to be just as mysterious as how he plans on feeding his people a kid who listened a little too closely to his deranged father for a bit too long but does have the ability to press the big red button whenever he wants PERIOD

America seems to have enough enemies across the globe as of late and throwing ourselves into another global conflict doesnt sound like the best strategy for a country with a bit of an economic issue PERIOD

War is almost never the answer but this country should never just allow another nation to flat out threaten its people or those of an ally with nuclear weapons PERIOD

So what to do with the nation on everyones list for worst run country in the world now that theyve promised an attack on both South Korea and mainland America

Simple enough nothing different than what this countrys been doing anyway PERIOD

North Korea is simply a toddler inside of a grocery store whos screaming for candy PERIOD America just needs to calmly walk out and tell Kim JongUn he wont be getting any dessert tonight all the while knowing that if the brat needs a spanking the Red White and Blue would be happy to deliver PERIOD

Threats against the United States certainly arent uncommon considering while Osama Bin Laden still walked this earth it felt like America received  new messages of doom a day but sometimes a nation pokes the bear a bit too hard and far too often PERIOD

If the North Korean military does deliver on its promise of some sort of attack it will not just be the U.S PERIOD that will strike back PERIOD No one not even North Koreas only friend China would come to its rescue at that point PERIOD

The entire South Korean force along with any and all American troops available would quickly create the worlds largest parking spot right where Pyongyang used to be in a matter of days PERIOD

More than likely this is nothing more than a large amount of hot air from the North Koreans who try this bit every few years into feebly forcing free nations into giving them aid PERIOD In this case the true losers in all of this mess are the same whove been the losers for years the people of North Korea PERIOD

The people whove had to deal with three generations of crazed genocidal idiots but are so brainwashed they line up in droves to see them like theyre rock stars PERIOD

Killing a world leader is always going to remain a touchy subject to say the least but in instances like this where the world may hang in the balance its time to make an exception PERIOD
