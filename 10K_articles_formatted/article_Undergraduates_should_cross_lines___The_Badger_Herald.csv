2725,2004-04-27,"today the Teaching Assistants Association of the University of
WisconsinMadison begins a twoday strike meant to further pressure
the Office of State Employment Relations into a contract agreeable
to the union PERIOD TAs and PAs have set up picket lines outside major
buildings while some undergraduates refuse to cross those lines 
a show of support for their TAs PERIOD Still other students and
professors conduct classes at substitute locations PERIOD In spite of
these developments we again call on undergraduates to reflect on
this situation in detail and cross picket lines Do not let the TAA
carry out its hypocritical actions unchecked PERIOD

The TAAs tactics have the political effect of driving many
students to support its position but this board questions that
legitimacy PERIOD Why should students many of whom support the TAs be
the ones to miss out on classes as a result of problems at the
negotiation table Why should students be put through the trouble
of missing class  classes made more expensive as of late  when
many seek academic counsel at this crucial time shortly before
finals Undergraduates should not suffer for the current stalemate
yet the TAA seems willing to make them do just that PERIOD

We again ask those students considering crossing the lines to
look at history PERIOD When the state Legislature chose to significantly
increase the tuition of undergraduates at this university the TAA
did not raise such a fuss PERIOD But now that TAA interests are on the
line it asks students to work with it to stop the States
continual degradation of University funding PERIOD We question whether
undergraduates should be so willing to sacrifice for the TAA when
said organization was unwilling to do the same PERIOD

In an interview with this Board the Office of State Employment
Relations made it clear that any possible strike actions by the TAA
would be illegal not only under state law but also under its
current contract PERIOD In similar interviews representatives of the TAA
acknowledged this but called their actions a form of civil
disobedience. some argue students should join the TAs in order to
learn the true meaning of an education in citizenship PERIOD This board
might sympathize with just such an argument if the law to be broken
were blatantly unjust PERIOD Yet the union agreed not to strike under its
current contract PERIOD A careless premeditated dishonoring of that
contract is not a form of education  it is a form of lawlessness PERIOD
Promoting such reckless action is hardly an education in upstanding
citizenship PERIOD

In the end students must realize the TAAs actions are
hypocritical PERIOD It claims to stand up for the University but hurts
undergraduates in the process PERIOD The TAA wants to preserve the
economic integrity of the institution  effectively asking students
to join it  but was unwilling to take similarly drastic actions to
prevent undergraduate tuition hikes PERIOD Its supporters call on
students to join in an act of civil disobedience even if the TAA
acknowledges the tactic as illegal PERIOD

Undergraduates must not be afraid to cross lines PERIOD Such an action
is justified PERIOD
