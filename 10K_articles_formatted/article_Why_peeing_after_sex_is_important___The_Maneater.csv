Heres some life advice  pee after sex PERIOD Especially for people with vaginas peeing after sex helps to flush any bacteria out of the urethra that may have been pushed around there during intercourse PERIOD The biggest benefit from this is that it prevents urinary tract infections PERIOD

UTI is an infection of the urethra bladder or both that may turn into a kidney infection if left untreated PERIOD UTIs are very common  in fact  percent of people with vaginas will get one during their lifetimes PERIOD But because they can turn into a much more serious infection its important to take them seriously and seek medical attention if you believe you may have one PERIOD

UTIs occur when bacteria enters the urethra travels to the bladder and causes an infection PERIOD Most commonly this bacteria originates from another region of a persons genital area PERIOD The spreading of this bacteria can occur during any sexual activity when your partners genitals fingers mouth or anus come into contact with your genitals PERIOD Less commonly UTIs can be caused by some sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis PERIOD

Unlike STIs UTIs cannot be spread from person to person via intercourse but may be made worse during sex if more bacteria enters the urethra PERIOD UTIs are also not only caused by sex PERIOD Any activity in which bacteria gets near the urethra can cause UTIs PERIOD Swimming in public pools or lakes pregnancy improper hygiene and use of antibiotics are all other common causes of UTIs PERIOD

People with vaginas those who are sexually active people who use diaphragms and spermicide as a contraceptive and those who are pregnant or going through menopause are all at greater risk for contracting a UTI PERIOD In addition people who have had UTIs in the past are more likely to get another one than those who have never had one PERIOD

Symptoms include pain or burning while urinating foulsmelling or cloudy urine blood or pus in the urine and cramping or soreness in your lower back and sides PERIOD If a UTI is left untreated and moves into the kidney additional symptoms such as fever chills nausea vomiting and sharp pain in the mid back to the right or left of the spine may occur PERIOD If these symptoms occur it is incredibly important to seek medical attention as soon as possible as kidney infections can be very serious and lead to greater complications PERIOD

Treatment for UTIs may include the use of antibiotics to kill harmful bacteria PERIOD Drinking lots of fluids like cranberry juice and water is also recommended in conjunction with antibiotics as it helps to flush out bacteria faster than antibiotics alone PERIOD

Prevention is also very important when it comes to not getting UTIs PERIOD This can include making sure to drink enough fluids using the restroom when you feel the urge taking cranberry pills if you are prone to UTIs and of course peeing after sex PERIOD All of these things will reduce your risk of contracting a UTI PERIOD

Its advised to go to the bathroom as soon after sex as possible PERIOD While you may have some wiggle room depending on how susceptible you are to contracting UTIs its still better to urinate sooner rather than later PERIOD This will make sure as much bacteria is expelled from your urethra PERIOD Dont worry  your partners will still be there for postcoital cuddles when you get back PERIOD

One common myth is that peeing after sex will rinse out a vagina and prevent pregnancy PERIOD Since the urethra and the vagina are two separate holes peeing after sex will not rinse out your vagina because you dont pee out of your vagina PERIOD If you are trying to prevent pregnancy while engaging in penetrative sex with someone with a penis its important to use other contraceptive methods PERIOD

Peeing after sex will not eliminate your chance of getting a UTI PERIOD UTIs can result from a myriad of other causes many not having anything to do with sex PERIOD So if using the bathroom right after sex isnt a part of your postcoital routine it might be time to reconsider this and start telling UTIs to piss off PERIOD
