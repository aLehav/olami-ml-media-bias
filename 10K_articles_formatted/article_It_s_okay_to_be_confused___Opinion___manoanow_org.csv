Updated November     pm





Students should be encouraged to take classes outside of their requirements to be exposed to new materials PERIOD

At the age of  young adults can vote play the lotto go to jail sign up for the military and serve PERIOD Therefore at the age of  young adults are expected to be capable of narrowing down their interests to one PERIOD In the midst of experimenting with friends relationships socializing literature culture and education adolescents are asked to choose their career before they even know what their options are PERIOD

Students should be encouraged to embrace all of their interests and be exposed to new material beyond their immediate reach before they make a decision PERIOD

DISCOURAGED STUDENTS

If I knew what I wanted to study from the beginning I wouldve had my bachelors degree by now said Kira Stephens a 23yearold University of Hawaii at Mnoa student PERIOD

After studying business at California State University Channel Islands Stephens took a leave of absence and got her aestheticians license PERIOD She originally studied business switched to the practice of aesthetics then to dental hygiene and is now in holistic nutrition as a dietician PERIOD

Stephens decided to return to school to take prerequisite courses soon after working as an aesthetician PERIOD

I wasnt sure what to study Stephens said PERIOD But I knew I wanted to do more with my life. growing up with a nutritious diet and fresh meals prepared from scratch Stephens was accustomed to wellrounded dieting PERIOD

I always had this fixation on living a healthy lifestyle she said. when I found out I could study nutrition it just made sense PERIOD I didnt know there was a field for that. the pressure to choose a single major to study in college is greater than any other pressure PERIOD It is perpetuated by friends adults family educators coworkers and even strangers PERIOD The pressure to experiment with drugs by peers or the pressure to have sex by hormonal youths are not as ubiquitous as the pressure to decide the path of ones future PERIOD Graduating high school some students know more about Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber than they know about themselves PERIOD Why limit a students field of study to just one major

CONFUSION KNOWS BEST

I started studying architecture because thats what my mom did said Arthi Reddy finance and international business student PERIOD I have a passion for design PERIOD Yet I felt like I didnt belong there. after two years of enduring architecture at her home university in Hyderabad India Reddy made a bold decision to study abroad PERIOD During the eleventh and twelfth grade years in India students pick between two streams of study math physics and chemistry or math economics and commerce PERIOD Reddy chose to study the latter PERIOD While taking electives in economics Reddy found herself drawn to finance PERIOD

Education can be enlightening if it is geared toward our interests or if students are allowed to experiment with new classes and school clubs to discover an interest PERIOD Students need to learn to live as if time was infinite PERIOD Students should take classes because they want to show enough determination and money will not be a problem PERIOD At the age of  young adults behave as if their time was limitless so why not apply this attitude to their education and future

College courses can be expensive PERIOD It is practical and cost effective for students to gear themselves towards a particular course of study as opposed to taking extra time money and work to actually find what they are passionate about  or find what they are not passionate about PERIOD Most higher education graduates end up in a career unrelated to their investment in classes PERIOD Its okay to be confused PERIOD One of my high school teachers once told me that you learn most when you are confused. rEMAINING OPENMINDED

While conversing with my previous English professor Gary Davis of Miami Dade College I told him about my desire to achieve and accomplish many things as well as my concern about not being able to shorten my list of studies PERIOD As a seeker of knowledge adventure and discovery I hope that journalism can be my gateway into all that inspires me PERIOD

Professor Davis told me about my dilemma What a wonderful curse PERIOD You have so many interests that you cannot decide on one PERIOD Dont ever let anyone tell you to limit your options PERIOD Some middleaged people still dont know what they want to do and here you are with too much to choose from. we as students need to have fun with our education PERIOD Its the only way we will feel motivated to learn PERIOD Experience and expand PERIOD Learn and laugh PERIOD If we live as if our time is limited we would all go into the safe careers without any aspiration PERIOD Fields such as art English music and philosophy would be forgotten PERIOD Playing it safe makes for a gradually unsatisfying future PERIOD

If I listened to everyone else and studied business I would have been unhappy Stephens said PERIOD I have no regrets with all my previous schooling PERIOD If I didnt go through all those steps it wouldnt have led me to where I am now PERIOD I know this is where Im meant to be. when students are not allowed or encouraged to explore there is a lack of motivation PERIOD Its not just the price or limited types of classes offered PERIOD Students who are confused about what they truly want to do often settle on business accounting or hospitality PERIOD

However in my experience in higher education I realized that many of the resources offered are not handed to me or flashing in neon lights PERIOD It is my responsibility as a determined student to network join clubs that may or may not relate to my interests and to take advantage of the events and seminars held on campus PERIOD The students who decide to get passing grades and never take the opportunity to learn beyond their boundaries are missing out on the true values of education PERIOD

You always use something somewhere Reddy said PERIOD My education is not wasted itll always be useful for me. reddy stated that she has benefitted from starting off with architecture PERIOD Though she no longer studies architecture she applies what she has learned to enrich her life PERIOD

APPROACHING THE FUTURE WITH UNCERTAINTY

You have to remember that nobody starts where they end PERIOD You start where you start and work your way from there Professor Davis said PERIOD I never finished reading a book until I was  and now I have my Ph.D PERIOD in American Literature PERIOD Dont compare yourself to the experts thats not fair. i quit the race to compete against the professionals PERIOD I simply do not have the proper training yet PERIOD The pressure to compare my two years of higher education to my professors years of experience was overwhelming PERIOD It is this masochistic mentality that veers students toward their comfort zone PERIOD If they are willing students must challenge themselves to help embrace and determine their interest in unknown fields PERIOD Thats how education should be received PERIOD

I know this is what I want to do I just need to explore my career path more PERIOD Find my niche Stephens said after years of schooling and finally deciding on dietetics PERIOD

At  Stephens can envision her life in this field while still being open to exploring and discovering other areas of expertise PERIOD Maybe she will be a private consultant a health coach or even use her business background to open a health food caf PERIOD This is how we should approach our future PERIOD

Students should not feel that it is necessary to know what they want to do in college and life PERIOD The future is unpredictable and what you think you enjoy today might change in the future PERIOD
