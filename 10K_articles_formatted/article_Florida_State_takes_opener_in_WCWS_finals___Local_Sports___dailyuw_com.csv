Freshman Gabbie Plain lived on the edge all game against Florida State but mostly stayed out of trouble allowing just one run on a solo homer in the sixth PERIOD Unfortunately for Washington her counterpart FSUs Meghan King was even better PERIOD

If the No PERIOD  Washington softball team had the momentum coming into its first Womens College World Series championship series since  Meghan King took it away quickly PERIOD The Florida State junior pitched a complete game shutout outdueling freshman Gabbie Plain and the No PERIOD  Seminoles   ACC beat the Huskies   Pac12  PERIOD

Washingtons first loss of the postseason puts the Dawgs up against the wall PERIOD The Huskies and Seminoles will meet again tomorrow at  p.m. in Oklahoma City PERIOD A UW win would force a decisive third game Wednesday PERIOD

King threw seven shutout innings allowing five hits and a pair of walks and striking out six UW batters PERIOD Plains line looked remarkable similar  five hits three walks six strikeouts  with one mistake in the sixth inning to Anna Shelnutt that was punished for a solo home run PERIOD

After a pair of easy innings Plain and King began trading stressful frames PERIOD Beginning in the top of the third the Seminoles put runners in scoring position in the four of the last five innings including loading the bases with no outs in the top of the fourth PERIOD

Plain struggled a bit with control reaching eight threeball counts PERIOD That finally caught up with her against Shelnutt when she grooved a belthigh offering on a  count that ended up in the leftfield bleachers PERIOD

It was the first home run given up by a UW pitcher in over a month since Oregons DJ Sanders took Plain deep at Husky Softball Stadium on April  PERIOD

Meanwhile King was living on the edge against the Washington batters PERIOD The Huskies loaded the bases with one out for the heart of their order on a pair of infield singles and a hit batter but King struck out Julia DePonte and Kirstyn Thomas to end the threat PERIOD

The home run ended up being everything King  needed for the win though she got some help from her defense PERIOD In the bottom of the seventh inning sophomore second baseman Taryn Atlee led off with a single up the middle  Washingtons first hit to the outfield of the game PERIOD Senior right fielder Trysten Melhart tried to bunt her to second but popped up her attempt just a little bit PERIOD FSU third baseman Jessie Warren charging hard on the play laid out to make the catch then came up and fired to first to double off Atlee PERIOD

Washington managed another on a Kelly Burdick infield single but King got senior third baseman Taylor Van Zee to ground out to end the game and put the Dawgs in a hole in the series PERIOD

Atlee Melhart and Burdick combined for four of the UWs five hits with Burdick going 2for3 PERIOD

Its the first time all season Washington has lost to an opponent from outside of the Pac12 and just the fifth time the Huskies have been shut out PERIOD
