Operations at Campus Recreation noticed a failure within the pools filtration system said Terry Elmore associate director of operations PERIOD

He noted that fixing the filtration system willrequire several steps PERIOD CRCEis waiting on the appropriate pieces to come in from the manufacturer before itcan begin the next step PERIOD

The manufacturer will send somebody to install them PERIOD Well get them up and running and see if everything matches up and then well be operating Elmore said PERIOD We dont have a timeline right now but were just waiting on pieces to come in from the manufacturer for the filtration system. cRCE does not know when it will reopen PERIOD

Its a waiting game its a matter of whenever that piece comes in Elmore said PERIOD I know they had to manufacture it themselves so its not something that was sitting on the shelf. all group fitness aquatics programs at CRCE are cancelled until the pool is working again PERIOD
