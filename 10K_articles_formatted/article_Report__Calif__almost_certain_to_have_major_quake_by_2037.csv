LOS ANGELES AP  California faces an almost certain risk of being rocked by a strong earthquake by  scientists said Monday in the first statewide temblor forecast PERIOD

New calculations reveal there is a . percent chance a magnitude . quake or larger will strike in the next  years PERIOD The odds of such an event are higher in Southern California than Northern California  percent versus  percent PERIOD

It basically guarantees its going to happen said Ned Field a geophysicist with the U.S PERIOD Geological Survey in Pasadena and lead author of the report PERIOD

The  Northridge earthquake under Los Angeles San Fernando Valley was magnitude . pERIOD It killed  people injured more than  and caused  billion in damage in the metropolitan area PERIOD

The damage created by an earthquake depends greatly on where it hits PERIOD A . quake  much stronger than Northridge  hit the Mojave Desert in  but caused only a few injuries and no deaths PERIOD

California is one of the worlds most seismically active regions PERIOD More than  faults crisscross the state which sits atop two of Earths major tectonic plates the Pacific and North American plates PERIOD About  quakes each year rattle Southern California alone although most of them are too small to be felt PERIOD

The analysis is the first comprehensive effort by the USGS Southern California Earthquake Center and California Geological Survey to calculate earthquake probabilities for the entire state using newly available data PERIOD Previous quake probabilities focused on specific regions and used various methodologies that made it difficult to compare PERIOD

For example a  report found the San Francisco Bay Area faced a  percent chance of being struck by a magnitude . quake by  PERIOD The new study increased the likelihood slightly to  percent by  PERIOD For the Los Angeles Basin the probability is higher at  percent PERIOD There is no past comparison for the Los Angeles area PERIOD

Scientists still cannot predict exactly where in the state such a quake will occur or when PERIOD But they say the analysis should be a wakeup call for residents to prepare for a natural disaster in earthquake country PERIOD

Knowing the likelihood of a strong earthquake is the first step in allowing scientists to draw up hazard maps that show the potential severity of ground shaking in an area PERIOD The information can also help with updating building codes and emergency plans and setting earthquake insurance rates PERIOD

A big earthquake can happen tomorrow or it can happen  years from now said Tom Jordan director of the earthquake center which is headquartered at the University of Southern California PERIOD

Researchers also calculated the statewide probabilities for larger temblors over the same time period PERIOD Among their findings There is a  percent chance of a magnitude  shock or larger a  percent chance of a magnitude . and a . percent chance of a magnitude  PERIOD

The odds are higher that a magnitude . quake will hit Southern California than Northern California   percent versus  percent PERIOD

Of all the faults in the state the southern San Andreas which runs from Parkfield in central California southeast to the Salton Sea appears most primed to break scientists found PERIOD There is a  percent chance in the next three decades that a Northridgesize quake will occur on the fault compared to  percent for the northern section PERIOD

The northern San Andreas produced the  San Francisco earthquake but the southernmost segment has not popped in more than three centuries PERIOD

Scientists are also concerned about the Hayward and San Jacinto faults which have a  percent chance of producing a Northridgesize temblor in the next  years PERIOD The Hayward fault runs through densely populated cities in the San Francisco Bay Area PERIOD The San Jacinto fault bisects the fastgrowing city of San Bernardino east of Los Angeles PERIOD
