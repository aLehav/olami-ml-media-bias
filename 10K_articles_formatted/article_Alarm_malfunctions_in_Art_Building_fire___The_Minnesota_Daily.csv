The University is investigating the alarm failure PERIOD Fire inspectors and officials from Facilities Management went through the building Monday to determine the status of the fire systems said Jennifer Schulz spokeswoman for Facilities Management PERIOD
The cause of the failure should be known today PERIOD

University officials have plans to build a new art building although its funding has been in question since Gov PERIOD Jesse Ventura dropped it from his capital budget recommendations in January PERIOD University faculty members and students have lobbied the Legislature to help fund the  million project because of safety concerns such as Saturdays firealarm failure PERIOD
There are sirens in the building but they are concentrated on the main floor not spread throughout the building PERIOD
The fire started around  p.m PERIOD Saturday night in a closed locker PERIOD Melissa Frankman an art senior first saw the fire and with several friends tried to put it out by aiming the fire extinguishers at the locker vents PERIOD

Frankman grabbed a chemical fire extinguisher after seeing the burning pile of oily rags and started spraying but soon felt the effects of the smoke PERIOD
We were all feeling nauseated and lightheaded and we decided to get the hell out of the building Frankman said PERIOD
Frankman and two other students who helped put out the fire spent several hours in a hospital emergency room breathing oxygen after the incident she said PERIOD
Facilities Management was notified of the fire by University Police PERIOD Normally Facilities Management would have been notified of an Art Building fire when its automatic sprinklers activated PERIOD In this incident they did not turn on although the fire might not have been large enough to activate them Schulz said PERIOD
