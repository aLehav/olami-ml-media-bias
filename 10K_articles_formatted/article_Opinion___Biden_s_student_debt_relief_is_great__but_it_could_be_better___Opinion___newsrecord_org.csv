The White House PERIOD

Student debt relief has been a longstanding topic of conversation in the college crowd PERIOD Witha slight majorityof fouryear collegegoers   of public and  of private  taking out college loans at an average of  its unsurprising that its popular PERIOD UntilBidens recent plan however forgiving federal student loans was mostly limited to a policy position withvast supportamong the populous or limited to very specific circumstances PERIOD

So how does the Biden plan work It offers up to  in debt relief to those borrowing any loans from the U.S PERIOD Department of Education with a few caveats PERIOD For example your annual income must be below   per couple and Pell Grant students are given up to  while others can have a max of  canceled PERIOD

Along with this forgiveness it also changes several mechanisms of the debt repayment process including halving the discretionary income paid into college loans each month to  increasing the ceiling for discretionary income and covering unpaid monthly interest so long as monthly payments are made PERIOD

Although these changes are a step towards the policy beliefs of large swathes of the U.S PERIOD population there are at least two significant areas in which they fall short The debt relief is not enough and college loan forgiveness while effective for the middle class fails to serve those in our society who need it most PERIOD

Looking at the average again its clear the maximum of  for Pell Grant recipients is not enough to take most loan holders out of debt  but it easily could have been PERIOD Previous calls from fellow Democratic Party membersin both chambersof Congress promoted up to  in federal loan forgiveness that could have nearly doubled the average passed via the same executive authority Biden used to institute his current plan PERIOD Whats more onetime relief doesnt fix the root cause of the problem the overwhelming cost of secondary education in the U.S PERIOD

Unfortunately neither of those critiques eat at the bigger issue PERIOD Student debt relief is great and should be done but asignificant portionof those who owe are in the  to one hundredth percentile of income PERIOD In contrast those at the bottom  of income account for far less than  of student debt PERIOD This paints the picture of a bigger issue student debt relief must be paired with other more progressive methods of combating wealth inequality to truly have a lasting impact on the poorest in our nation PERIOD

For example raising the federal minimum wage while a hefty step forward from the onetime repayment plan presented and significantly harder to achieve would allow individuals and families living off near or atminimumwage pay to increase their standard of living PERIOD Broadly expanding guaranteed workers rights in general is effective PERIOD Those in poverty are most affected by lack of paid leave or sick days where a single case of COVID19 or the like can result in not paying bills on time PERIOD Changes like these would dramatically impact those that arent going to college and are thus more likely to work a minimum wage job while also somewhat alleviating the disparity in pay and socioeconomic position that minorities suffer from PERIOD

While no change alone can fix all the problems present in the U.S. any start is a good one  and this is no exception PERIOD However while celebrating loan forgiveness or any other progressive victory it is always important to analyze policy outcomes and fight for our government to do better for our communities PERIOD
