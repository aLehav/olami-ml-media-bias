Hotel reservations

Not so fast there hoss PERIOD

Please for the love of Husker mania if you your parents your friends someone you know or anyone you can get hold of has reservations in aLincoln motel this weekend for the game give them up PERIOD

Cancel them PERIOD

Someone else needs them PERIOD

Someone without heat PERIOD

Someone without electricity PERIOD

Someone without a refrigerator for a home PERIOD

And the  people without electricity arent the only ones who need your hotel room PERIOD

In the rush to get peoples power back on Lincoln Electric System has brought in hundreds of contractors PERIOD These folks are working long hours to get the lights back on PERIOD

Dont make them camp out in their trucks PERIOD

Yeah it is the Oklahoma game PERIOD Sure its Husker football PERIOD And you have had those reservations made for more than a year PERIOD

But look into your heart PERIOD Who needs a warm bed and a shower more

If you are coming to town for the game think about driving back home that night PERIOD If that isnt an option there is an alternative probably more fun than hotels PERIOD

UNL has opened up Cook Pavilion to the Husker faithful wanting to stayin Lincoln overnight PERIOD The wideopen artificial turf will turn to bed padding for one night PERIOD

And what could be better than sleeping where the Huskers practice

What Husker maniac wouldnt go home and say with pride  Think of all the aura PERIOD 

Most of Lincolns  motel and hotel rooms are booked PERIOD But the question is who is sleeping where this weekend

How would you like to sleep in a cold house

How would you like it if you sought refuge at a hotel spending serious money to stay warm only to be evicted by a football fan

Were sorry but as important as football is to this state it isnt that important PERIOD

It isnt as important as people getting their power back PERIOD

It isnt as important as letting stranded people sleep in comfort PERIOD

Football can take a back seat PERIOD Yes even the Oklahoma game PERIOD

Please were begging PERIOD If you can give up your hotel reservations ortell someone else to give up theirs please do PERIOD

A true Husker would PERIOD
