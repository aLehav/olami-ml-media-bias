Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Cruz Paul Rubio Clinton  with the  presidential election approaching panel discussions political debates and takedown ads arent far off PERIOD

However since Clinton began expressing interest in the Oval Office conservative media has begun to sound less like news and more like an old episode of Sesame Street. three of these things belong together Three of these things are kind of the same Can you guess which one of these doesnt belong

We get it PERIOD Clinton unlike Cruz Paul and Rubio is a woman however she is also a very successful politician and former first lady Secretary of State and U.S PERIOD Senator PERIOD However even these accomplishments seem to be meaningless in the eyes of the far right PERIOD

You can almost say folks said Rush Limbaugh in an April  broadcast that Mrs PERIOD Clinton worked very hard throughout her whole life and she stuck by her husband while he humiliated her embarrassed her  affair after affair after affair  and now Hillary has reached a pinnacle PERIOD

And all she is is a secretary. criticism of Hillary tends to focus almost exclusively on her gender instead of her politics PERIOD Instead of discussing her views on immigration or healthcare they are questioning whether or not the birth of her grandchild will in any way impede her ability to run a country PERIOD

An article in Christian Science Monitor stated If we had to guess wed say that Hillary Clinton will be a tad less interested in running for president now that shes about to be a grandmother. a Jezebel article addressing the sexist nature of the claim said The only way this question wouldnt be sexist is if we lived in a society in which women running for president were required to offer up their firstborn grandchild as a sacrifice to the electoral gods. the Penn is in no way endorsing Clinton nor are we trying to sway our readership to choose a side PERIOD We would simply like the media to focus on the political views of the  candidates instead of gender PERIOD

Just remember Ronald Reagan Jimmy Carter Franklin Roosevelt Thomas Jefferson and John Adams all had grandchildren when they were sworn into office and no one questioned their ability to lead their country PERIOD
