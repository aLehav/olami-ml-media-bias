Age 

Experience U.S PERIOD Senator from Alaska 

Fun Fact Gravel served as the CEO of KUSH a company which makes marijuanainfused products for recreational and medicinal use PERIOD

Gravel is possibly the most interesting candidate in the entire Democratic field for the simple reason that he doesnt actually want to be President PERIOD The goal of Gravels campaign is to make it to the debate stage in order to be a voice for several progressive issues PERIOD Among these issues include a pacifist foreign policy massive military spending cuts providing housing internet access and other amenities as rights of American citizens and implementing term limits for all federal judges including Supreme Court justices PERIOD

Even though Gravel is the oldest candidate in the race at age  his campaign is run by a duo of progressive teenagers from New York PERIOD Unfortunately for Gravel his campaign staff have made some rather incendiary comments  not approved by Gravel himself towards other Democratic candidates on Gravels own Twitter account PERIOD
