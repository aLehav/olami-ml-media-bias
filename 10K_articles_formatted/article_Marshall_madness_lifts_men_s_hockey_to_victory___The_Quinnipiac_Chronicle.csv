I felt kind of helpless Quinnipiac students from Maine reflect on Lewiston mass shooting

Why Guns N Roses needs a new album

Quinnipiac head coach Rand Pecknold challenged David Marshall earlier last week to play better PERIOD Of course with Yale on the schedule for the mens hockey team Friday the sophomore forward probably didnt need that challenge PERIOD

Marshall has had no trouble scoring against Yale over the course of the brief rivalry between the two teams and that trend continued Friday as he scored twice to help Quinnipiac win  before a sellout crowd of  at the TD Banknorth Sports Center PERIOD

In four career games against the Bulldogs Marshall has scored six goals and had the gamewinner in both wins this season PERIOD

Hes a Yale killer Pecknold said PERIOD Hes been great every game. marshall was on the ice when Yale scored a shorthanded goal  into the third period to cut Quinnipiacs lead to  PERIOD He blamed himself for the goal and quickly redeemed himself when he answered  later with the eventual gamewinner on the power play PERIOD

I felt it was on my shoulders to get it back Marshall said PERIOD To come back the next shift and score was a big thing PERIOD It was my fault that we gave up that goal so I felt that I needed to get it back. quinnipiac took advantage of Yales lack of discipline converting on four of  power plays and finishing with  shots on the man advantage PERIOD

Our power play has been a little flat lately PERIOD Weve tried to change a couple things and certainly I was happy with that tonight Pecknold said PERIOD

The Bobcats were able to tie the game at  on their twentieth shot of the game  into the second period when Matt Sorteberg standing midway across the Yale blue line scored on a slap shot that clanked off the left post and in PERIOD

Greg Holt made it  with  left in the period when his shot from the point beat a screened Alec Richards  saves PERIOD

The Bobcats opened the third period with a pair of goals to take a  lead PERIOD After Marshall scored on the man advantage at  Ben Nelson banged in a quick rebound at the right post three minutes later on a 5on3 advantage PERIOD

Thats a bigtime goal Pecknold said PERIOD No goalie is going to make that save. bud Fisher allowed four goals on  shots PERIOD Yale beat the buzzer at the end of the third while on a twoman advantage for its fourth goal PERIOD

BROWN  QU 

Playing its fourth game in seven days Quinnipiac allowed three quick goals early in the third period Saturday night as it lost  to Brown in Providence R.I PERIOD

With the loss Quinnipiac   ECACHL fell back into third place in the ECACHL PERIOD
