Saying this years Illinois hockey team faced high expectations heading into this semester would be an understatement PERIOD

Following last seasons perfect  campaign in which the team became CSCHL regularseason and playoff Champions and ACHA National Champions every win was no longer just a win  each extended a winning streak that was unheard of in club hockey PERIOD

Cruising through the first eight games of the season with ease was expected but struggling with a Central Oklahoma team that the Illini dominated last year  and  was not PERIOD

In the first game of the away series against Central Oklahoma the Illini erased a twogoal deficit with three goals in the final eight minutes to win  and keep the streak alive PERIOD

In game two they again found themselves behind this time by three goals in the third period PERIOD The Illini scored two goals to get within one with five minutes left but they couldnt match their heroics of the previous night and lost  snapping their 47game winning streak PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

After beating the top club teams in the nation time and time again last season the team was shocked PERIOD

We were all kind of stunned that we actually lost a game junior center JJ Heredia said PERIOD Honestly I didnt think we would lose to Central Oklahoma PERIOD I dont think a lot of the guys did so maybe thats part of the reason PERIOD We took them a little light. with the end to a memorable run behind them the players amped up their efforts and went on a tear against Robert Morris and MichiganDearborn winning the four games PERIOD

After the second loss of the season came to No PERIOD 2ranked Lindenwood in a series split the Illini swept Eastern Michigan to finish up the semester with a record of  overall and  in CSCHL play PERIOD","Illini hockey ends streak, finishes 16-2 - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
