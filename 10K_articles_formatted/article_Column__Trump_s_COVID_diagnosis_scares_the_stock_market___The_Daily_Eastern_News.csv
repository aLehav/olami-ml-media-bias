The first week of October is complete and an insane amount of information has been thrown at us PERIOD With the impending election and continuing pandemic it seems like every day we are thrown for a loop with new information PERIOD

At the beginning of the month no information was more globally shocking or talked about than the news of President Donald Trump testing positive for COVID19 and being sent to Walter Reed Hospital for treatment PERIOD

It seems like everyone had a different reaction to this information but one area that saw a shift as a result of the news was the stock market PERIOD In the hours following the announcement of Trumps diagnosis stocks fell over  overall PERIOD

The Dow Jones SP  and Nasdaq all fell between  and  percent last Friday in the early trading hours PERIOD A lot of stock market analysts say this happened due to a kneejerk reaction from investors who were likely uncertain about how this news would affect the markets PERIOD

In the hours and days following the dip in the markets stocks seemed to regulate undoing any damage done PERIOD

Its important to consider why Trumps COVID19 diagnosis has anything to do with the stock market seeing as it has no direct effect on it PERIOD This type of news is something that investors have to pay attention to because they incorporate political risks into trading decisions PERIOD

As morbid as it sounds investors understand that if Trump were to die of COVID19 chaos would likely follow PERIOD Drastic changes in the stock market have happened with presidents before including when JFK was assassinated and when Woodrow Wilson had the Spanish flu PERIOD

Investors were already hoping for an upturn in consumer spending if another stimulus package is approved but this week has shown a stalling of that approval by Donald Trump PERIOD And as more and more people under Trumps administration test positive for COVID19 theres more uncertainty among investors PERIOD

I think that what matters now is less about what happens with Trump and his administrations recovery from COVID19 but what happens after the election PERIOD Regardless of the outcome come November this election will set the precedent for the stock markets for the upcoming year and the entirety of the next presidents term PERIOD
