Updated November     pm



Most Creighton students can explain the basics of a few Jesuit values at the universitys core but when College of Arts and Sciences senior Katie Cascino has the chance to talk to about her passion for charisms like Cura Personalis or Magis her face breaks into a huge grin PERIOD

A wavy hazelcolored topknot towered over Cascinos small stature as she entered the Skutt Student Center and expertly maneuvered her way through a flood of students PERIOD Her speech got faster as she talked about her experiences at Creighton and explained her affinity for the Jesuit values that Creighton was founded on PERIOD As she spoke her devotion to upholding the wellbeing of others became increasingly evident PERIOD

Learning about Jesuit values completely affected my college experience said Cascino PERIOD In discovering a passion for the wellbeing of others and caring for the whole person I was able to develop a minor based on Cura Personalis. cascino is communication studies major and the first Creighton student to pursue a healthy lifestyles minor which focuses on the study of theory and practice of health of the whole person PERIOD

Since last April Cascino has worked at the Wellness Council of America WELCOA which works to help businesses and health professionals improve corporate wellness and promote healthier cultures in the workplace PERIOD She started as a social media intern organizing and facilitating all product marketing on Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn including coordinating the companys first blog PERIOD

In August Cascino accepted a permanent position at WELCOA as a marketing and operations specialist PERIOD Her job is primarily focused on marketing strategy and closely analyzing data to strengthen social networking content scheduling and customer engagement PERIOD Recently she initiated a campaign to support WELCOAs new On the Move product for which she produced creative marketing videos and worked on social media promotion PERIOD

Cascino is also involved in various organizations on Creightons campus PERIOD She has been an intern for Creightons Homecoming weekend and a desk assistant for Campus Recreation PERIOD She previously held the position of health and wellness chair for Pi Beta Phi sorority where her job was to promote healthy choices and wellbeing for members by conducting weekly fitness and nutrition challenges wellness education and group reflection PERIOD

This year she also served as the recruitment chair on Dance Marathons executive team PERIOD Margaret Zimmer assistant director for fraternity and sorority life at Creighton was able to work closely with Cascino through Dance Marathon PERIOD

What strikes me most about Katie is her passion said Zimmer PERIOD Her enthusiasm is contagious and that is how we knew she could get people to register for and excited about Dance Marathon as the recruitment executive this year PERIOD Katie is someone who truly cares about the people she encounters and I believe everyone who knows her breathes a little easier as a result. as those who know her can attest Cascinos support for her friends knows no bounds PERIOD

Katie is someone who will view the special moments in your life and demand enthusiasm on your behalf from others said Heider College of Business senior Anna Flaherty PERIOD

Cascino says her Creighton experience can be described in one word community PERIOD She cites Creightons tightknit community as the driving force that pushed her to grow and reach her full potential PERIOD

According to her closest friends Cascino is never afraid to be herself and her outgoing personality brings a smile to everyone she sees PERIOD

One of my favorite memories of Katie was walking down the mall one night with her when she sang every word to All Too Well by Taylor Swift said College of Nursing senior Maggie Gorman PERIOD She belted every lyric and I could not stop laughing because she was just so unabashedly herself PERIOD She didnt care who heard her or what they thought because in that moment it brought her joy PERIOD She uses her personality to connect with others and I am so excited to see where her journey with WELCOA takes her. in addition to her campus involvement Cascino regularly volunteers at Omaha Childrens Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha and Northwest Community Hospital in her hometown of Arlington Heights Illinois PERIOD
