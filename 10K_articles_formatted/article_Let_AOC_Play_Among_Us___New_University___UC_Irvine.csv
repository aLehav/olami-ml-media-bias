2634,2023-11-04,"with arguably the most important election of our generation playing out Democratic Rep PERIOD Alexandria OcasioCortez took to the streamingplatform Twitch this past week to encourage voting among youth by playing Among Us with fellow Democratic Rep PERIOD Ilhan Omar PERIOD Nearly half a million viewers watched live as AOC played with a host of streamers including big names Pokimane and Myth making this one of the mostwatched streams on the platform  and an effective way to get younger voters energized PERIOD

Playing Among Us  a popular game that places the player as either a crewmate of a spaceship who must complete tasks or an imposter whose role is to kill the crewmates without being caught  isnt the most conventional way to encourage voting PERIOD Yet AOC reached millions of viewers who could either vote themselves or remind their parents to vote PERIOD She directed viewers to IWillVote.com a website with information on how to register and vote PERIOD With a new generation born and raised on the internet AOC knows how to appeal to new voters something many politicians have failed to do in the past PERIOD

Throughout the stream AOC showed that shes a real person who cares about the people she serves PERIOD One viewer wrote watching tonight gives me such hope for positive change. at one point during the stream AOC talked about free health care and acknowledged why it might be so difficult to achieve in the U.S PERIOD because people just dont even believe its possible. she explained why its so important to vote and encouraged those who cannot to talk to their friends and family about their voting plan PERIOD Instead of just asking those close to you if they will vote AOC encouraged viewers to discuss creating plans to vote PERIOD This motivates individuals to actually think about when theyre going to vote and what for PERIOD

Of course some thought OcasioCortez couldnt simply have a fun time on Twitch to encourage voting PERIOD Opposers took to Tik Tok and Twitter to criticize her for being unprofessional or for wasting her time on games PERIOD AOCs opposers seem to have missed that she did this getoutthevote effort entirely on her own time and dismissed the fact that she had fun while doing so PERIOD AOC is unfairly being held to a higher standard where she is not allowed to take a break or have some fun every once in a while especially during a time where millions are cut off from each other because of COVID19 PERIOD

The focus of her stream was dedicated to voting yet many criticized her on other issues PERIOD One viewer in particular asked why she wasnt pushing for a stimulus instead of playing games PERIOD In reality OcasioCortez has pushed for a stimulus but passing such a package is dependent on a majority in Congress not solely up to her PERIOD It seems that no matter what AOC does it just isnt enough for her critics PERIOD

Whether OcasioCortez is using this platform to encourage voting or not she should still be able to spend her free time how she chooses PERIOD Though shes a representative shes still human PERIOD She deserves the ability to take some time off work and play a video game if she pleases PERIOD President Trump constantly takes frequent trips to play golf for no other reason than to simply enjoy himself PERIOD If he can do that then AOC should be able to connect with voters through Among Us shouldnt she Perhaps AOC is being unfairly criticized because of the negative sentiment associated with video games and other youth platforms while golf as a more traditional hobby in older demographics is accepted by mainstream politics PERIOD However as younger people get more involved in politics it is important to engage with them in a way that both motivates and accepts them PERIOD

AOC bridges politics to the youth PERIOD As a former bartender she understands the lives of workingclass individuals and aims to represent the peoples needs PERIOD Unlike some politicians who constantly try to portray a certain image through a diplomatic facade AOC isnt afraid to show what she stands for PERIOD With this stream OcasioCortez encourages voter engagement and gives young people a new outlook on politics PERIOD
