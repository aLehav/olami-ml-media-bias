If you have a shopping addiction like me its almost a natural instinct to browse stores when you have free time PERIOD But getting out of bed and leaving the house to shop when it is cold and snowy is a hassle and frankly doesnt seem worth it PERIOD

Thats where online shopping comes in PERIOD

It can be a saving grace when it comes to needing specific clothes for an upcoming event PERIOD And if you dont have time to go to the store which most students can relate to online shopping is the perfect solution PERIOD Here are some tips to help your online shopping experience be the best it can be PERIOD

 PERIOD Always look for online sales

The majority of the time online stores have promotions like buy one get one offers free shipping or small percentages off your first purchase PERIOD Making sure you know about these sales is easy PERIOD All you have to do is sign up for store emails to get notified when they start and end PERIOD I know these sites can be annoying when it comes to spamming your inbox but my advice is to make an email account specifically for online site subscriptions because it will make your online shopping experience much better PERIOD It is also an easy way to keep all of the discounts in one spot so youre not constantly looking through other important emails to find the current deals going on PERIOD

 PERIOD Check the sizing

When shopping online it can be hard to find reassurance that what you buy will fit you the way you want it to PERIOD You usually see a picture of the garment on the model but that doesnt really help considering the proportions might be off PERIOD Not all of us are that tall and lean PERIOD But on most sites there is a size guide in the description to help you out PERIOD Make sure you know your own waist hips and bust measurements before online shopping so you can use the chart to its full advantage and purchase the size that will fit you best PERIOD

 PERIOD Leave items in your cart

Putting items in your cart but not buying them right away can actually be more beneficial than you might think PERIOD Not only does this help you avoid impulsive buys but it can also make the websites customer service team reach out to you and ask why you havent completed your purchase PERIOD This outreach often leads to them offering you some sort of discount in order to go through with your transaction PERIOD So the next time you want to proceed to the checkout page sleep on it first and see if a discount comes your way PERIOD

 PERIOD Look at the product reviews

The last problem customers want to encounter is when an item they buy online isnt what they originally thought it was PERIOD This is why it is crucial you look at other customer reviews of the garment PERIOD The comments section can shine a light on a problem you might face PERIOD For example you might find out that the dress youve been pining after runs too short or a blouse you want tends to be too seethrough PERIOD You cant always trust the pictures the site gives you so your best bet is listening to other customers who have already bought the piece PERIOD
