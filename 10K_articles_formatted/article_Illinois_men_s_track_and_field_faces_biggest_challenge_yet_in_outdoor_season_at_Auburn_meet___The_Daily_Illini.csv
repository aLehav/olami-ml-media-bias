2506,2023-10-26,"the Illinois mens track and field team will face its first major challenge of the outdoor season this weekend as the team travels to Auburn Ala. for the Tiger Track Classic PERIOD

It will be the first scoring meet for the Illini against highlevel competition during the outdoor campaign as they compete against elite teams from the ACC and SEC such as Clemson and host Auburn PERIOD

This is a meet that always attracts some of the better sprinters and hurdlers in the country head coach Mike Turk said PERIOD This is the first real challenge for us and it will be a much greater challenge for us than the first meet at Mississippi State. one of the biggest disadvantages the Illini face is that many of the southern teams have been training outdoors for a greater period of time given that the weather is more conducive to outdoor training PERIOD Turk said many of the teams competitors are a few weeks ahead of his squad in terms of training and the adjustment to the outdoor season with many already at midseason form PERIOD

Illinois will have the majority of its topline sprinters and runners competing in their main events over the weekend PERIOD Turk had previously been trying some of his best athletes in different events such as senior Ryan Lynn running in the  meters PERIOD Lynn will return to his main event the  meters and sophomore Brandon Stryganek will run the  and 200meter dashes and junior Stephon Pamilton in the 400meter dash PERIOD Stryganek sat out the  in favor of the long jump at last weekends Bill Cornell Spring Classic while Pamilton did not compete PERIOD



Guys that ran at indoor nationals like Stephon and Ryan are still a week or two behind in their training so this will be another chance to see some of our top level guys improve Turk said PERIOD We just want to see some solid marks from the guys competing in their main events and see them take another step toward getting to midseason form by the time Drake Relays roll around. the other main focus for the Illini will be once again on the further progression of the 400meter relay PERIOD After a firstplace finish last weekend the relay squad will have its first opportunity of the season to square off versus much tougher competition PERIOD The relay will feature  as it did last week  juniors Vanier Joseph and Julian Smith and sophomores DJ Zahn and Stryganek PERIOD

We got off to a decent start in the  but we have so much room to improve especially in our exchanges Smith said PERIOD

Smith will also compete individually in the   and the long jump PERIOD

Im looking to get my time down in the  and  to get back to the place I was at the same time last season he said PERIOD In the long jump since the first time Im doing it Im just happy to do all that I can to help score points for us. dan can be reached at
