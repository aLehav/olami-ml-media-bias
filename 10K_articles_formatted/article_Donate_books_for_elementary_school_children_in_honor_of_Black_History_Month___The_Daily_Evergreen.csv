Jackson said he hopes to inspire the next generation and his younger self with this event PERIOD Growing up he did not see or read books with characters who had curly hair and dark skin like his PERIOD His inspiration came from his parents who demonstrated what it was to be hard working PERIOD

Children have challenges and their goals can seem far away Jackson said PERIOD Books with characters who students can identify with are powerful because they show students their goals are attainable PERIOD

Jackson said he hears about change happening all around him and it is exciting he gets to see and be part of that change PERIOD

Shook One by Charlamagne ThaGod is Jacksons favorite book by a Black author PERIOD He said it addresses the importance of being open about your mental health PERIOD The topic resonated with him as a studentathlete because athletes mental health is often overlooked or pushed to the side PERIOD

Especially him being such a public figure someone who interviews artists and celebrities day by day kind of for him to put them in a book that was kind of powerful Jackson said PERIOD
