Dear University of Oregon Black Students

Although it is not a surprise to our community it is with deep grief that we mourn the killings of our beloved Black sisters and brothers Breonna Taylor Sandra Bland Kendra Bell Laquan McDonald Ahmaud Arbery Patrick Pat Pat Kimmons and George Floyd to name a few PERIOD It is especially anguishing for us to pen this letter because we know how these killings are deleteriously affecting your academic pursuits our shared grief pierces our hopes and makes certainty and control over our lives feel illusory PERIOD

In the U.S. especially the city of Eugene Oregon and UO sorrow and distress comes to all PERIOD To most it comes with acridest misery because it emanates as a surprise PERIOD To the Black community especially Black UO students sorrow and distress is an occurrence we have learned to expect it is known and felt always PERIOD Despite this reality we the UO Black Student Task Force Black Women of Achievement Black Male Alliance Black Law Student Association and the African Student Association stand firm in our solidarity and support for one another PERIOD Additionally while we know perfect relief is impossible we will continue to rally and keep the thoughts of our aforementioned murdered sisters and brothers in mind with hopes that it allows their loved ones a temporary alleviation of their permanent distress PERIOD

At the UO antiBlackness manifests in many ways PERIOD If there is any group that has been inflicted with the wrath of antiBlackness it is the Black Student Task Force PERIOD In our attempt to have an independent Black Studies Department we have been caricatured stripped away from access to academic resources denied from entering public and open talks from our campus during visits by Bobby Seale Erika Huggins etc. received threatening emails from Ethnic Studies professors been dropped by our McNair Scholars research thesis chair and have had the police falsely called on us because we are quite simply Black and respectfully working to fulfill our list of demands PERIOD In particular the experience of being threatened for demanding Black Studies Department and being targeted by getting police called on us has been deeply troubling PERIOD In the Black community we all know that any police interaction can easily end in the death penalty for us PERIOD

Academically at the UO studies of the African American experience especially Black Studies has received a death penalty since time immemorial PERIOD Unlike many universities the reason Black Studies has been sentenced to academic fatality is not simply due to illinformed or racist white administrators PERIOD NonBlack faculty of color have led in this crusade and engaged in a relentless and determined effort to stop an independent Black Studies Department from arriving at UO PERIOD Despite these efforts BSTF along with the support of BWA BSU ASA BMA and BLSA have continued to advocate for OUR demand the arrival of an independent Black Studies Department PERIOD

Since November  the Black Student Task Force with our list of demands in hand has been and continues to be the student group that leads the charge in improving the safety and academic success of UO Black students PERIOD With the concurrent support of the BWA BMA BLSA ASA and BSU the Black Student Task Force will continue to work to accomplish every demand we have penned PERIOD We will do so with the support of our united Black student group leadership and overall populace PERIOD We will also do so with the forefront pragmatic and impartial leadership of UO President Michael Schill PERIOD

We appreciate and understand the gains we have made on our list of demands PERIOD Nevertheless we understand the need to do more PERIOD We need Demand Number  to be met which is a commitment to creating a funding resource and scholarship initiative for African American students PERIOD We need UO to hire Black faculty for Black Studies PERIOD We need UO to commit to supporting our current Black Studies interim director PERIOD We need the UO to commit to hiring Black Studies faculty that have distinguished research and expertise in Black Americancentered approach to race PERIOD We need Black Studies to continue to be separate from Ethnic Studies and become a Ph.D.offering department PERIOD We need the currently met demands to heed our original intent PERIOD

The Black Cultural Center arrived at the UO via our list of demands and continued work PERIOD We need to be acknowledged in the BCC PERIOD We demand an acknowledgment that is not a mere symbolic gesture it must be a permanent acknowledgement that will provide pride and teaching moments for future Black students akin to an interpretive exhibit the university has already committed to PERIOD We need to be the authors of our acknowledgment in the BCC PERIOD We demand to be acknowledged and write our own biography in the BCC not for adulation but to receive just due credit that African Americans have historically been denied and subsequently inspire future Black students and avoid ahistorical narratives PERIOD If these demands are not met can the UO administration truly proclaim that Black Lives Matter PERIOD

We do not need Black students to heed a recent professors editorial of implicitly encouraging African American students to protest and defy city curfew PERIOD We ask our Black student populace to not heed to this or any other call that risks them breaking the law and subsequently being killed PERIOD

We do not want nonBlack students to speak on behalf of us PERIOD We do not want nonBlack Studies academics to speak on or for the needs of Black Studies and Black students PERIOD

We are prepared to make sure our unmet demands come to fruition PERIOD We dont want lip service PERIOD We dont want care or consultation or comfort or a hug PERIOD We want tangible and BSTFinclusive action Based on President Schills history we remain confident that he does as well PERIOD
