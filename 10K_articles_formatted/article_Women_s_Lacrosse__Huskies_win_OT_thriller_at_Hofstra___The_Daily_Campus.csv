6970,2023-11-03,"for the third time in three days the UConn womens lacrosse team hit the road for New York this time facing off against the Hofstra Pride on Long Island PERIOD The Pride have been largely unimpressive through their first  matches notching just three wins good for a KPI rating of No PERIOD  nationally out of the  competing squads PERIOD They scored what looked to be a great win over ranked Vanderbilt early but the Commodores have disappointed with a sub . record PERIOD Despite their rough record Hofstra did their very best to give the Huskies a good fight but ultimately faltered losing  in overtime PERIOD

Grace Coon had a killer performance once again lighting up the Pride for a hat trick and two assists PERIOD Her third score was the most important of the contest as it was the suddendeath gamewinner in overtime PERIOD Coon has been in a zone as of late with  points across her last three games two of which the Huskies have won PERIOD Shes third on the team in scoring providing the veteran leadership expected out of a graduate student PERIOD

Another player who made her mark on the game is Susan Lafountain posting four goals PERIOD The Rochester New York native is having a career year on pace for her best scoring output PERIOD Shes just one goal shy of her seasontotal mark she set last year and the team hasnt even hit conference play yet PERIOD Its encouraging to have the junior stepping up to fill in the scoring gaps from last year and making such a considerable jump PERIOD Shes second on the squad in goals and isnt stopping anytime soon evident from her eight scores in her past two outings PERIOD Its also important to note her assist on Coons game winner demonstrating her abilities in the passing department PERIOD

After posting seven points in the Albany win Kate Shaffer took a bit more of a backseat in this win scoring just a pair of goals PERIOD Shaffer has continued her breakout party that started halfway through last season pacing the Huskies in scoring and assists PERIOD Its hard to guess where Connecticut would be without Shaffer this year but its easy to imagine a record poorer than  PERIOD The supporting cast has been a big part in the Huskies success too but Shaffer has taken the cake as the teams alpha PERIOD

Hofstra scored two in the opening four minutes of action but UConn is rarely phased by deficits PERIOD Shaffer Lafountain and Lia LaPrise all scored within a minute of each other and suddenly the game had turned on the Pride PERIOD Hofstra had an appropriate response scoring three of the next four goals but Lafountain managed to tie things at five to wrap the quarter up PERIOD

Shaffer and LaPrises second goals each helped the Huskies jump out to an  lead to start the second frame creating a  run PERIOD The Pride ripped off a pair of goals to narrow the lead but Lafountain and Coon responded with two of their own PERIOD Connecticut looked to take a threegoal lead into the break but a last second score from Katie Kelly snuffed those hopes PERIOD

Hofstra built on their momentum with two goals to open the half but each was answered by Huskies finding the back of the net PERIOD The Prides big break came over a nearly  minute stretch between the third and fourth quarters where they scored three straight without allowing any PERIOD Now down for the first time since early in the first period things were not looking up for UConn PERIOD

That was until Lafountain buried the ball into goal forcing overtime PERIOD Tied at  in the extra period Connecticut dramatically controlled the draw and called the timeout near striking distance PERIOD Lafountain drew attention from the defenders leaving Coon open PERIOD Coon collected the pass from Lafountain and rifled a shot past the keeper winning the game for UConn PERIOD

The Huskies chance to build on this dramatic win will come at Columbia this Saturday evening providing a nice appetizer for those planning on tuning into the Mens Basketball Final Four game PERIOD
