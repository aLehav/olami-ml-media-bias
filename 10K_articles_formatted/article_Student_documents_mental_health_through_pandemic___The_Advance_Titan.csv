The pandemic has had drastic impacts on almost every area of life from forcing people to work and attend school from home to moving social interactions online PERIOD

One of the major impacts the pandemic has had is the one on peoples mental health PERIOD

It has forced people into isolation cut them off from visiting loved ones and instilled a sense of anxiety from the possibility of being exposed to the coronavirus and not knowing what the future holds PERIOD

It has worsened peoples mental health increased substance use and elevated suicidal ideation PERIOD

Thats why when the pandemic hit last year UW Oshkosh senior Abby Bullard immediately thought about how quarantine and the coronavirus would impact her mental health PERIOD

At the beginning of the pandemic Bullard began documenting how quarantine was affecting her emotional wellbeing academics and time spent on social media for a sociology course PERIOD

Bullard said her mental health was fine at the beginning of the pandemic because the warmer weather allowed her to stay busy with outdoor activities PERIOD

When the weather got colder during the pandemic is when I noticed a decline in my mental health she said PERIOD I was staying inside often and was extremely unmotivated. bullard found that a major deterrent to her mental health was the amount of time the pandemic had caused her to spend on social media PERIOD

Bullard said her social media intake nearly doubled during the pandemic PERIOD

Whether I was listening to music scrolling through social media finding recipes on Pinterest or shopping online the percentage of time I was spending on my phone was going up she said PERIOD

Bullard said the more time she was stuck at home the more time she spent on social media PERIOD

Snapchat is one of the first things I check when I wake up in the morning it has been a way for my friends and me to share memories moments and our daily lives with each other while we cannot be fully present in each others lives she said PERIOD

While social media allowed her to stay connected to friends and family while in quarantine Bullard said social media became a big distraction during the pandemic PERIOD

My social media usage made me feel even more isolated and alone she said PERIOD

Bullard said it started to take away focus from her classes and her grades started to suffer from it PERIOD

She said she became more careless with her courses and less eager to participate in class discussions PERIOD

I felt more comfortable behind a computer screen she said PERIOD

UWO Counseling Center director Sandy Cox said loneliness has been a hard aspect of the college experience during the pandemic PERIOD

Students have had to learn new ways to connect enjoy college life and cope with lifes challenges and it hasnt been easy she said PERIOD

Cox said it can be stressful for students who are missing out on developing close friendships and interacting with people in classes because of the pandemic PERIOD

Students report missing many of the normal activities of daytoday life she said PERIOD

However they have consistently reported to us their gratitude for continuing to have the opportunities and services available to them to successfully continue their education she said PERIOD

I am extremely extroverted and love being present with my professors and peers in the classroom she said PERIOD

She misses interacting with her friends on campus and when the pandemic took that away from her she lost interest in her coursework as well PERIOD

As a RadioTVFilm major I was used to being around my friends and other students every day doing handson learning she said PERIOD

Through documenting her own wellbeing and researching how the pandemic negatively affected peoples mental health Bullard adopted two kittens to cope with the struggles of COVID19 PERIOD

They helped me practice my creativity and forced me to get up and be active when I didnt feel like it she said PERIOD
