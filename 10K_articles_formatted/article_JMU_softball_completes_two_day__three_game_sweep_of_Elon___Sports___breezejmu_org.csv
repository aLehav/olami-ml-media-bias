Megan Good and the Dukes congratulate each other in a home game earlier in the season PERIOD

Despite sloppy fielding and uncharacteristic mistakes JMU softball   CAA used another strong pitching performance from Megan Good to beat Elon  on an emotional Senior Day PERIOD

Its a feeling I cant really explain senior infielder Madyson Moran said PERIOD It sucks that this was my Senior Day but I had my teammates to back me up. luckily for Moran and the seniors the Dukes will play in the CAA championships in Harrisonburg beginning on Wednesday PERIOD

It makes it a lot easier knowing that this isnt the last time Im going to play on this field Moran said PERIOD

Good  who won every game in the Dukes sweep of the Phoenix pitched a combined  innings while allowing just nine hits and recording  strikeouts without allowing an earned run over the three games PERIOD The junior started all three games in the twoday series due to a low pitch count PERIOD

We dont really look at the innings head coach Mickey Dean said PERIOD What we look at is the pitches shes thrown in games .. PERIOD weve been lucky in keeping her number of pitches way down. lapses in concentration hurt the Dukes in the top of the first as they made two costly errors which led to an Elon run PERIOD The first error a dropped popup by freshman catcher Kierstin Roadcap allowed the Phoenixs leadoff hitter junior Hannah Olson to reach second base PERIOD Following a sac bunt to move the runner to third Elon attempted a suicide squeeze which was foiled by a nifty play from Roadcap PERIOD

The catcher quickly picked up the ball spun around and tagged Olson out at home PERIOD While Roadcap made the play Elons senior catcher Carey Million darted toward second base which forced a wild throw from Roadcap and made its way into an empty centerfield PERIOD The ball trickled all the way to the centerfield wall as Million went around the bases to put the Phoenix up  which infuriated Dean PERIOD

Today was a weird day Dean said PERIOD I dont know maybe it was everything that was going on PERIOD It was just a weird defensive day for me. coming into the game with the secondbest fielding percentage in the CAA the Dukes made a seasonhigh four errors PERIOD

Even with the fielding struggles JMU busted the game open in the bottom of the second with a fiverun frame PERIOD The Dukes used three hits two walks and one Elon error to take a commanding lead PERIOD JMU strung good atbats together to explode for the fiverun burst PERIOD

After scoreless frames in the third fourth and fifth innings junior slugger Jessica Mrozek hit a higharching pinchhit homer in the bottom of the sixth PERIOD The Dukes took a  lead and won by the same score PERIOD In the threegame series Mrozek came to the plate twice and smacked home runs in both atbats PERIOD

Honestly I think my approach has changed since the beginning Mrozek said PERIOD At first I was just swinging to swing and now I think Im trying to be more relaxed and see a pitch that I can drive. next up for the Dukes is the winner of the No PERIOD  vs PERIOD No PERIOD  seed matchup in the CAA tournament PERIOD First pitch is roughly scheduled for  p.m PERIOD on Wednesday at Veterans Memorial Park PERIOD
