It seems as though the public is hypersensitive when it comes to young Disney stars growing up PERIOD Sorry folks but young girls turn into women and women have the right to express their sexuality PERIOD

Britney Spears was the first Disney princess to seriously raise eyebrows with the release of her video Im a Slave 4U back in  and now 17yearold Miley Cyrus is the latest to shake up the media world with her becomingly sexualized video Who Owns My heart. the music video showcases scenes with Cyrus in laced panties and a black tank top on a bed as well as bearing her legs in a limousine PERIOD Yes shes a Disney product but that doesnt mean she can be Hannah Montana forever PERIOD

I suppose theres no real transition from being an innocent TV star to a sexy bonafide pop star PERIOD Its like a teenage boy getting underarm hair PERIOD He doesnt realize its happening until one day its just there PERIOD Its a part of growing up PERIOD

Plus you dont see the media scrutinizing young male artists who flaunt their sexuality PERIOD Four words for you Justin Timberlake wardrobe malfunction. what is up with the media obsessing over innocence in the entertainment industry anyway It seems like an oxymoron PERIOD

The problem derives from society not knowing whether to treat teenage girls like smaller versions of grown women that should still be monitored or be treated like naive virgins in need of societys protection PERIOD

What the media is missing is that teenagers are at a vital age absorbing life lessons about love morality etc. they are socially and intellectually curious PERIOD However society is more focused on the fact that teenage girls wear short skirts and tank tops and are beginning to experiment with sex PERIOD

Interest in sex is inherent in humans PERIOD Society cant stop the process and shouldnt want to PERIOD We should be more concerned with helping teens enter the adult world with good ethics and respect towards others PERIOD

According to Kaiser Family Foundation . years is the median age for sexual intercourse in America which means  percent of twelfth graders have had sex PERIOD

In her article Sex and the Highly Gifted Adolescent counselor Annette Revel Sheely said

Many parents find it difficult to acknowledge their adolescents emerging sexuality PERIOD Yet they are the very people who can be most influential in guiding their teen towards a positive adult sexuality PERIOD

In any family this emergence can be quite a challenge PERIOD For families with highly gifted adolescents however it can be especially confusing PERIOD Some characteristics innate to the highly gifted can complicate an adolescents developing sexuality PERIOD These include asynchrony either early or late sexual development social isolation sensual over excitability and androgyny PERIOD

But gifted or not and whether we are adolescent or older sexuality is a central part of our identity and impacts how we interact with others and make use of our creative talents. breaking away from the Disney mold is a difficult process PERIOD Cyrus is growing up and will no longer be that cute little girl that sings about her papas brand new friend. shes nearly a legal adult and should not be scrutinized for growing up PERIOD Besides arent Snooki and The Situation more fascinating people to ridicule

Sorry there are no recent results for popular commented articles PERIOD
