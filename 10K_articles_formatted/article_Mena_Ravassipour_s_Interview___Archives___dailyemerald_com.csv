7655,1970-01-01,"oregon Daily Emerald So why dont you start by telling me a little bit about yourself PERIOD Whats your year and major

Mena Ravassipour Im a sophomore and my major is general science with high hopes to go to medical school PERIOD I grew up in Portland and went to Metropolitan High School PERIOD

Emerald Are you currently involved in any groups or activities here on campus

Ravassipour Well Im a senator right now and so that has a lot of subcommittees that Im involved in PERIOD The Faculty Personnel Committee the University Senate and Im also on the University Exec as well PERIOD

Emerald What seat are you currently

Ravassipour Im AcademicUndeclared Seat  PERIOD

Emerald Why are you interested in student government

Ravassipour Well Ive always been interested in student government PERIOD When I came in as a freshmen I was an intern with the ASUO and I had wanted to do it when I first started but unfortunately with classes and everything it didnt work out PERIOD So I ended up doing it I believe for two or one term last year and then I was actually appointed to Seat  by Rachel Pilliod and the Exec PERIOD But I had been planning  I was going to run PERIOD I just think its really amazing and its very important for people to get involved especially for people who have  I think everybody has a voice that should be heard but I think some people are too intimidated to always stand out and say what they believe in PERIOD So Id like to think that Im a good liaison between the two PERIOD Im not always the most articulate but I do think that the underdogs need to be represented PERIOD

Emerald How will you figure out how to spend the surplus

Ravassipour Well I dont think it lays on one individual person PERIOD I think its definitely a group process PERIOD I think PFC did a pretty good job this year and well I know that senators are required to go to  I believe its eight the equivalent of one night or eight senate meetings something like that  and I did that and I thought it was really amazing and hence Im running for PFC because I think it would be an amazing process to get involved with and I think its important to be responsible when allocating student funds PERIOD And so  youre question was why or how

Emerald How will you figure out how to spend 

Ravassipour Oh responsibly PERIOD I think that you should take a look at each individual group and go from there with how youre going to go about it and I think that all senators should be aware PERIOD I feel like I look at each individual group PERIOD I think that theres different circumstances for each one and so I definitely think its a group process PERIOD

Emerald A group process in that 

Ravassipour Well a group process I think that not only should the PFC be aware of other peoples budgets but also I think that its important that the representative for the different groups have a good connection or are letting the different groups know how the process goes so that its not like the groups always have to come to the PFC member that its definitely a dialogue between the two PERIOD And also that all senate members get involved PERIOD Yes senate is a body that allocates student funds but I think that its important that each individual senator  academic EMU it doesnt matter  like its still important for them to know everything about most peoples budgets and so I think thats why its a group process PERIOD

Emerald And how would you work to involve all those different people

Ravassipour Well every year senate goes on the retreat to teach you how to be a good senator PERIOD And there we do learn how to read the different books that tell you the different line items and how to go through the process and things like that PERIOD One of my roommates is Michael Sherman and so we go about it like every time we get together and we go over every single special request and we talk about other peoples budgets PERIOD And I just think if you create a dialogue with everyone on senate Im not saying there needs to be a space on the agenda but I think that the PFC members should let the other people on senate know that my office hours are here come talk to them PERIOD So I think I would just make sure that they felt comfortable enough to know that they could come and talk to me PERIOD

Emerald How will you interact with student groups

Ravassipour Well the whole reason why I wanted to do it was to make sure that they were given fair and equal treatment and I think that  Im not involved with as many student groups as I would like to be but I think that that might help me in the way that I wont take sides and favor one group PERIOD But I know a lot of people in these groups so I think that it would be helpful in just like I said creating a dialogue and then working with them and making sure they understand why they are getting cut or why they are getting more money and I think just making myself accessible to them and other members PERIOD

Emerald How will you make yourself more accessible

Ravassipour Well I think that sometimes people get too busy and dont  sure you can get a hold of me by email or telephone but I would pride myself on making sure that I call them often even when theres not a problem or their budget is coming up for review or anything like that PERIOD I just think it would be important to stop by now and then and be like Hey are you happy with the process Are you OK with whats going on You know just making sure that there isnt any problems or theyre not worried and just show my face around and let them know that Im not just going to be there when its budget time or in my office hours  any time PERIOD I guess just making them feel comfortable to be able to talk to me PERIOD

Emerald What are the most important issues facing the students you represent

Ravassipour Well I think there are many different issues PERIOD I think the University of Oregon is a very diverse group of people and so everyones concerns are important and everyones concerns are different PERIOD And so  how would I face them  I think that would be done on an individual basis PERIOD

Emerald What do you think the most important issues facing the people you represent are is what Im saying PERIOD Not how would you face those but what you think those issues are PERIOD

Ravassipour Well I guess I would just have to say that like I said before every case is different PERIOD But I mean  equal rights for all and making sure that its a fair and equal process PERIOD Student groups were talking about or just people on campus everyone

Emerald The students youll be representing PERIOD

Ravassipour Everyone PERIOD

Emerald Yeah PERIOD

Ravassipour Yeah I just think that theyre facing all sorts of different problems  tuition surcharge I just think everything PERIOD Im sorry I dont think I answered that quite like you wanted me to but I think that its too broad of a question to narrow it down and say if theres only one problem or that the majority of the people are facing this problem because everyone has their own concerns PERIOD

Emerald What is the most important thing you should know in order to deal with the budget process

Ravassipour Well I havent been on PFC I havent had any experience with the ins and the outs of the allocating process but since I am a senator and I feel like I have been to the budget hearings and I know how the process goes I think that one of the most important processes  is what it was

Emerald What is the most important thing you should know in order to deal with the budget process

Ravassipour Well I think that theres many things that you should know but I think the thing that you should remember is that theres opportunities out there and you have to be aware that theres opportunities PERIOD And so not always  its not all about numbers PERIOD You have to be aware that theres opportunities for expansion  for groups to grow PERIOD And you have to remember that PERIOD And I think that thats the most important thing is you need to remember that were out

there to create better groups so that more students can get involved and that people can feel like this is a community PERIOD

Emerald And how would you go about making the groups feel that they are more involved

Ravassipour More involved with the PFC process

Emerald Yeah you just said it was more important to make them feel more involved PERIOD

Ravassipour Well I think it ties back to what I said before you know just making the ASUO a warm place where they want to come PERIOD I mean Im sure that every group has their own  like you guys have your own office and PFC has their own  and just let them know that the ASUO can be like a center for them where they can come in and they feel comfortable enough to express their ideas and their views in there and just making it a warm and welcome place PERIOD And like I said before just letting them know that Im not only there when its PFC time or when its budget time but Ill be there no matter what time whenever they need help and that they should feel comfortable and Ill just go in there and talk to them PERIOD

Emerald Do you know how many standing committees the senate is obligated to have

Ravassipour Thats harsh PERIOD laughs PERIOD OK committees PERIOD I think thats Rule  PERIOD Lets see  you mean the different committees like Committee on Committees Rules Committee OK so theres Committee on Committees theres Rules Committee theres Finance Committee  now Im stressed out again PERIOD OK lets see then theres  theres more what is it we just redid the rules  Im on Finance Committee on Committees PERIOD Personnel Committee PERIOD Is that it or is there five Theres one more PERIOD I dont remember PERIOD What is it

Emerald Its the Summer Committee PERIOD

Ravassipour The summer

Emerald Yes PERIOD

Ravassipour I was a senator in the summer why didnt I know about that

Emerald Last question whats the most important part of Section  of the Student Senate Rules and why

Ravassipour OK Section  is duties PERIOD OK I dont think that there is one duty that is more important than the other PERIOD Im sure that thats probably what youve heard from most people but I think that thats an important thing to state because if youre not fulfilling one of your duties then youre not serving the student body as you should PERIOD Every rule is just as important as the other and so I dont think I can say which is more important PERIOD

Emerald Maybe not most important then how about a rule that you feel is very important  not necessarily more important than the rest but very important for you to fulfill as a senator PERIOD

Ravassipour Well just make sure you know that Im not saying that this is the most important PERIOD

Emerald OK PERIOD

Ravassipour Well I think that doing your duties and like coming to meetings going to office hours and having your presence around the groups or just in the office is very crucial because if you dont establish the relationship with the groups then they wont feel comfortable to come in there PERIOD So I think the rules of like office hours grievance hours and being to senate meetings are very important PERIOD
