7025,2021-03-13,"officials from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy voted unanimously to recommend that the state Legislature legalize the use of medical marijuana on Wednesday PERIOD

The proposal would reduce marijuana from a Schedule I controlled substance to a Schedule II classifying the drug as presenting the potential for abuse but also having acceptable medical uses PERIOD

If the suggestion passes through the Legislature the Board of Pharmacy would become the nations first such organization to back medical marijuana use PERIOD

Lloyd Jessen the director of Iowas Board of Pharmacy said because a state agency made the recommendations a legalization bill cannot be filed until next year at the earliest PERIOD

We are limited in that regard but there is nothing stopping state legislators from passing this eventually he said PERIOD I know the board is very pleased in the outcome PERIOD This decision is the culmination of a pretty massive undertaking. because of various other issues and a shortened legislative session expected to end in late March instead of April Jessen said he does not envision legislators having the time to approve the bill in  PERIOD

Wednesdays recommendations would also give the Board of Pharmacy the power to choose an advisory committee to aid legislators in properly drafting a bill PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Joe Bolkcom DIowa City told The Daily Iowan in October  that he is in favor of legalization PERIOD Rep PERIOD Mary Mascher DIowa City proposed a legalization bill that died on the committee floor during last years legislative session PERIOD

Ive heard from many Iowans who suffer in chronic pain from debilitating conditions Bolkcom told the DI on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD They find they would get some benefits and pain relief if they had access to medical marijuana. the deciding group consisting of four Board of Pharmacy members and two public participants made the recommendation after roughly six months of research and testimony PERIOD

The board at the urging of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa Foundation conducted four public forums from August to November  including one on the UI campus PERIOD

More than  people testified at these forums about the personal benefits they received from medical marijuana use PERIOD

The board looked carefully at the testimonies as well as results from the  states that have already legalized medical marijuana before making a decision Jessen said PERIOD

Jessen also pored over scientific data presented by ACLU officials at the final forum on Nov PERIOD  before he felt comfortable enough to begin deliberation PERIOD

We looked at this as something beneficial to the state and to many Iowans Jessen said PERIOD We had to make sure it was medically acceptable if used responsibly. despite the wealth of support from state officials some UI students are still unsure on the issue PERIOD

Im not opposed to it but I can see where it would pose problems said UI senior Teddy Solberg PERIOD

People might use it as an excuse to get their hands on it PERIOD But if theres scientific evidence that medical marijuana can help people then I would support it.",State board recommends legalizing medical marijuana - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
