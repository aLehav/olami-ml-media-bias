3240,2023-11-04,"creighton made a mistake against Marquette while down one point with  to go in the second half.Teams make these microissues all the time but usually get away with it unscathed PERIOD

Not this time PERIOD

As Marquette senior Andrew Rowsey dribbled the ball about  feet from the hoop sophomore Sam Hauser ran over to set a screen for him before quickly scurrying toward the basket PERIOD A miscommunication between Bluejay guards Davion Mintz and Marcus Foster left both of them taking a few steps in Hausers direction leaving Rowsey alone PERIOD

As soon as Mintzs feet encroachedon the 3point line Rowsey started his shooting motion knees and elbows perfectly aligned and shoulders brought slightly forward PERIOD By the time Mintz recovered a halfsecond later the ball was already in the air spinning toward the hoop PERIOD

I just saw both guys go and when youre out there playing you dont really realize where youre at Rowsey said after the game PERIOD I kind of realized once the ball was in the air Wow thats pretty deep. rowseys feet touched down just outside the blue circular decal labeled with the name of Al McGuire Marquettes legendary coach and namesake of the court PERIOD Several feet away current head coach Steve Wojciechowski prayed PERIOD

I was hoping Coach McGuire was looking down from heaven and would help that ball find the bottom of the net Wojo said PERIOD Coach McGuire was probably watching down on that shot. mcGuire may have been watching downon a lot of Rowseys shots at Marquette because the 5foot11 guard out of Lexington Virginia has consistently hit preposterous 3pointers like this one since stepping foot onto campus at the University of North CarolinaAsheville nearly five years ago PERIOD As an undersized shooter with limited defensive capabilities most major Division I coaches overlooked Rowsey PERIOD

When Rowsey announced his decision to transfer from UNCAsheville after torching the Big South Conference for two seasons Wojo took a look at the tape and saw something a little different than other coaches PERIOD Wojo saw a fearless competitor and a knockdown shooter someone with the confidence to pull up from anywhere on the court and actually make it PERIOD

I can remember scouting and thinking This kid is an absolute steal for UNCAsheville Wojo said prior to Saturdays game PERIOD Sometimes in recruiting you can look at a kid and say Hes too small but when I saw his competitiveness along with his skillset I thought hed be a great player at Asheville PERIOD Never in my wildest dreams did I think he would end up here. for Rowsey the decision to transfer boiled down to playing against better competition PERIOD He wanted the chance to share a court with the best players in the country which wasnt going to happen more than a few times a year at Asheville PERIOD

The recruiting pitch was kind of easy Rowsey said PERIOD Its Marquette PERIOD Its one of the best programs to exist in college basketball. he also had the opportunity to play for coaches that have been in his shoes before PERIOD

When I was looking to come to Marquette every one of their assistant coaches had played at a high DI level Rowsey said PERIOD We had Travis Diener Brett Nelson Coach Johnson Justin Gainey who left PERIOD

Rowseys performance against Creighton was a fitting end to his home career PERIOD Backtoback turnovers from Rowsey near the end of the first half helped Creighton grab an 11point lead and epitomized his occasional tendency to overdribble especially when the team was struggling PERIOD

He atoned with three straight 3pointers with less than four minutes left to complete Marquettes rally and highlight a 10of12 shooting spree from beyond the arc in the second half PERIOD

Thats kind of unheard of even if youre in the gym by yourself Creighton head coach Greg McDermott said of Marquettes secondhalf shooting spree PERIOD On a couple of those at crunch time Rowsey was out there probably pushing  feet. fellow guard Markus Howard was Rowseys sharpshooting partner in crime all season long PERIOD He hit four of his five secondhalf 3point attempts including some that were every bit as closely guarded as Rowseys PERIOD After the game Howard gave credit to Rowsey for stretching the defense PERIOD

Nothing surprises me after playing with Rowsey for two years Howard said PERIOD No shot is really a terrible shot for Andrew PERIOD Every shot he takes we have a good feeling its going in PERIOD When he shoots shots like the 35footer part of me wants to get back on defense without knowing whether hes going to make it PERIOD His confidence is so big for our team. despite Rowsey being known for his eyepoppingshooting numbers Wojo has insisted the offense works best with him as a distributor PERIOD The numbers support that statement as Marquette is  when Rowsey dishes eight assists or more and  when he has at least five PERIOD Rowsey had eight assists against Creighton with sophomore Sam Hauser on the receiving end of four of them PERIOD

One of Marquettes most effective plays all year was the pickandpop with Rowsey and Hauser PERIOD The forward setsa screen for Rowsey to run around then immediately sneaks along the 3point line for a return pass PERIOD If the defense commits too hard to stopping Rowsey Hauser one of the nations most accurate 3point shooters is open PERIOD Thats precisely what happened on Sam Hausers three with  left to give Marquette a  lead PERIOD

After the game Howard was happy about Rowseys  points but far happier about his eight rebounds and of course his assists PERIOD

When defenses collapsed we were able to find guys that were wide open Howard said PERIOD When guys are stepping up its really easy for Andrew and I to make plays. after the final whistle the 18221person crowd roared in a way that only a crowd that had gone to the brink and survived could roar PERIOD Rowsey and several teammates immediately ran over to the front row of the student sections throwing their arms in the air and highfiving students PERIOD

Ive pretty much had every emotion come my way these past  hours Rowsey said PERIOD It was just kind of being in the moment. theres no telling how many more moments Rowsey has in a Marquette uniform the BIG EAST Tournament next week will decide that PERIOD Those games couldnt have felt further away while Rowsey enveloped Wojo in a hug immediately following his interaction with the fans  two men savoring the euphoria of victory before heading into an uncertain future PERIOD
