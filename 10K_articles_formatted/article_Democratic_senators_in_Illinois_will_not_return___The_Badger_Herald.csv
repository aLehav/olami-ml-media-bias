2785,2011-03-10,"amid a flurry of legislative action and the resulting public uproar the  missing Democratic senators announced they would not return to Wisconsin Wednesday night and one senator said they will focus on recalling Republican senators if the amended collective bargaining bill passes PERIOD

Although speculation circulated that the senators would reenter the state as a result of the Senate passing a bill to eliminate collective bargaining for public workers as a nonfiscal issue the senators said the condition of their absence remains unchanged PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Jon Erpenbach DMiddleton said there was a consensus among the Democratic senators on the decision to remain out of the state in a caucus meeting that took place early in the day on Wednesday PERIOD

Erpenbach said the senators will be following legislative activities as the bill is introduced on the Assembly floor very closely PERIOD

He added the classification of collective bargaining rights as a nonfiscal issue marks another example of hypocrisy among Republican lawmakers as many Republicans had previously stated collective bargaining rights were a fiscal issue PERIOD

The Senate Republicans can still play a lot of games in the Legislature he said PERIOD This is just another example of the hypocritical position taken by the Walker administration. sen PERIOD Fred Risser DMadison said he suspects the senators will choose to return if the Assembly passes the bill but will not come back until the action on the bill is completed PERIOD

Risser said the Joint Conference Committees adoption of an amendment to strip the budget repair bill of fiscal items in a meeting called with less than two hours of notification presents significant legal questions and was in violation of strict open meeting laws set by the state PERIOD

He added he was shocked by the procedure Republican senators used to pass the bill particularly in refusing to allow the Democrat on the committee to introduce any amendments or offer testimony PERIOD

Regardless of whether the bill is passed by the Assembly Risser said the senators will return to fight Gov PERIOD Scott Walkers proposed budget bill and will shift their energy to possible recall elections for Republican senators who supported the legislation PERIOD

The end hasnt come yet this is only one battle in the field he said PERIOD Well be back at the appropriate time to bring attention to the worst budget thats ever been presented to the state. he added the renewed demonstrations at the Capitol Wednesday evening demonstrated the publics frustration with the antics of the Republicans and said he trusted the tone of the protests will remain peaceful PERIOD

While the Democratic senators are scattered as far south as Chicago and also much nearer to the state line he said they will continue to meet once a day to address new developments in the situation PERIOD

Risser said even if the legislation should pass he and his absent colleagues have succeeded in stalling the budget bill and garnering public attention for workers rights under attack across the state and helped galvanize a nationwide movement PERIOD
