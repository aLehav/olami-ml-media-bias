Updated November     pm



Heated discussions arose on two controversial topics at the University Affairs committee meeting Thursday the use of Associated Students Inc PERIOD funds for Greek organizations as well as the recent and controversial appointment of Dominick Prieto to the position of election commissioner PERIOD

In light of the consideration of the  budget by the Board of Directors Derek Tally  a sociology major and member at large on the University Affairs Committee called for a discussion on the use of ASI funds for the InterFraternity and PanHellenic Councils PERIOD He argued that because Greek organizations are exclusive to certain students and selective in their recruitment process the ASI funds they receive for events such as Greek Week and Greek Fest are not benefiting the entire student body PERIOD

There have been events funded by the student government that arent public or not publicized as being public said Tally PERIOD They may say that its public but there has never been to my knowledge any publicity for them. according to a proposed budget document Table  Funded Councils the PanHellenic Council could receive  and the InterFraternity Council could receive as much as  in ASI funds PERIOD These figures account for supplies printing and advertising contracts fees and rentals travel dues and subscriptions PERIOD

Christopher Labrot  a theatre and history major and member of the University Affairs committee felt as though Tallys points fell a little short PERIOD

I dont think that ASI funding for Greek events is doing the students of Cal State Fullerton a dishonor because we are pretty good about making sure that funding goes where it can be used for all students said Labrot PERIOD It sounded more like Tally had an issue with the recruitment of the Greek system which is not what we were talking about. labrot feels as though the way funds are allocated benefits all students and that the transparency of the budget process will ensure this in the future PERIOD

I think that the funding is fair Labrot said PERIOD If clubs dont think its fair they have the opportunity to come to us and request more funding and the budget is up there on the website for everyone to look at and argue about. chief Administrative Officer Megan Martinez confirmed that all students are allowed to attend events such as Greek Week PERIOD

Its for all students to go and give back to Camp Titan said Martinez PERIOD Camp Titan is a nonprofit childrens summer camp funded by ASI and staffed by student leaders PERIOD

Martinez said the committee will invite Maricela Alvarado the adviser for the PanHellenic Council the InterFraternity Council and the InterClub Council in order to gain a greater understanding of how ASI funds are used in these organizations PERIOD

The second item of discussion was the appointment of Dominick Prieto to the position of election commissioner PERIOD Tally and Lorenzo Frausto a board member for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences suggested changes in the bylaws in order to avoid future controversy PERIOD

Usually the outgoing ASI president appoints the new election commissioner at the end of his term PERIOD His appointee then must be confirmed by the board PERIOD Because Jay Jefferson the previous election commissioner stepped down in order to run as a vice presidential candidate President Joe Lopez was forced to appoint a new commissioner within his term PERIOD

While Lopez followed the correct procedures in appointing Prieto it sparked controversy in ASI PERIOD Led by elections assistant Nikhil Kulkarni over  polling assistants threatened to resign a week prior to the election because they felt the process Lopez took in making his decision was unfair and biased PERIOD

The discussion led mostly by Tally and Frausto brought up a number of possible solutions to the issue PERIOD The most developed of these would require the president to pick three potential candidates from the individuals that applied PERIOD Then the University Affairs Committee would interview all three candidates PERIOD Following the interviews the committee would present its top choice to the board for confirmation PERIOD

While no decisions were made on this issue in the meeting Tally plans on proposing a change in the bylaws at the next University Affairs meeting PERIOD
