Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

As a senior in high school nothing felt more stressful than college decisions PERIOD Youve made it to the final hurdle PERIOD Youve taken the classes received letters of acceptance toured the schools and now its time to choose PERIOD Looking back at who I was at  its easy to judge my past self for all the choices I wish I had made PERIOD

I didnt even apply to San Diego State when I was in high school PERIOD I had a onetrack mind to go to UC Santa Cruz and as soon as I got my acceptance in March I was sold PERIOD Little did I know life had a vastly different route for me PERIOD

Being a transfer student was not what I pictured for my college experience PERIOD I had decided that I wanted to be a journalist and UCSC didnt offer the degree I needed to be successful leaving me with no choice but to transfer to a new school PERIOD I changed majors moved more than  miles to Southern California signed a lease into a sorority house with  women Id never met and now Im graduating in five years instead of four PERIOD

I had envisioned that when I transferred SDSU would help me every step of the way considering I was switching from a UC to a CSU and had an unusual case PERIOD I found out that was not what would happen PERIOD

I accepted my admission offer in April with no indication that my classes wouldnt transfer properly PERIOD I signed a housing agreement with the school which was later canceled and once that was settled I booked a flight for my orientation in early August PERIOD

Flash forward to the end of my final quarter at UCSC in midJune PERIOD On the last day of finals for the summer I discovered on my Webportal account that my admission to SDSU was mysteriously rescinded PERIOD I hadnt received a call or any correspondence and no reason was given online PERIOD

After hours of phone calls and waiting on hold I was informed that after a full evaluation of my transcripts there was a discrepancy between by UCSC classes and the transfer requirements for SDSU PERIOD Therefore I failed to meet transfer admission requirements and the Admissions Office revoked my enrollment PERIOD

Since they informed me well after the registration date of any community college semester there was absolutely no way for me to take a replacement until the summer PERIOD In less than  hours I enrolled in summer classes starting the next week packed my entire apartment in Santa Cruz into my car and drove home PERIOD

I spent all summer going back and forth with SDSU admissions offices about what happened PERIOD I jumped through all their hoops PERIOD I filed the appeal work took and passed the classes and still they refused to budge PERIOD They fully intended to keep my  deposit and  payment for transfer orientation which they still have PERIOD

During this summer I was left with a lot of questions and over a year later they were never answered PERIOD In my appeal letter I included documentation from my local community college showing the class I took at UCSC was equivalent to the requirement in question PERIOD I had proof that the admissions offices never informed me of this issue before June and it was impossible for me to remedy the situation because I wasnt given the chance PERIOD After weeks of not knowing anything I called and learned SDSU would not reinstate me as a student and my appeal was denied PERIOD

I was two years into a degree and had nowhere to finish it PERIOD I had withdrawn from UCSC and had no interest in returning PERIOD I was forced to cancel my lease watch everyone around me go back to school and I was stuck in my hometown with no direction PERIOD

I spent the entire month of August in a mental health slump PERIOD My college experience had already been disappointing couldnt I have my transfer work out for me I felt slighted by the universe and definitely by SDSU PERIOD I felt like I was being punished for a mistake that I was never even given the opportunity to fix and one I wasnt even aware of until it was too late PERIOD

After a lot of talks and selfreflection I decided to take some action PERIOD At this point SDSU still had my  deposit thats supposed to go towards my tuition that no longer existed since I wasnt a student PERIOD I had now completed all the transfer requirements after my summer classes ended PERIOD

With nothing to lose I submitted a second appeal PERIOD This time I was fighting to defer my admission to the spring  semester PERIOD I wrote the letter filed the paperwork and let it take its course PERIOD

In midSeptember I finally received the news I was waiting to hear PERIOD My second appeal had been approved and I would be an Aztec starting Spring  PERIOD A decision from the appeals board couldnt be overturned by the admissions office so I was in for good PERIOD

My journey with transferring is far from over PERIOD I changed majors from art to journalism and even with that the process was further complicated by my transfer status PERIOD I was forced to submit a petition and skip the standard premajor process to be a journalism student PERIOD Instead of graduating this spring in  I will be a fifthyear student and walking in  PERIOD

Sometimes I just want to forget everything that happened with my experience getting into SDSU PERIOD I got what I wanted Im an Aztec after it all PERIOD Then I think about how I wish someone had shared my experience when I first decided to leave UCSC PERIOD

I think about all the ways SDSU should have supported me but didnt PERIOD That entire summer I didnt feel like a person PERIOD I felt like a set of numbers on a screen for them to disregard since it became inconvenient and complex to work with me PERIOD

I might be a student now but it still came at a price PERIOD SDSU needs to do better PERIOD
