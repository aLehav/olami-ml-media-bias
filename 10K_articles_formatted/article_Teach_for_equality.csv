One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Marian Wright Edelman founder and chief executive officer of the Childrens Defense Fund and Rep PERIOD John Lewis DGa. while speaking at the Teach For America summit last year in Washington D.C. argued that the fight for educational equality will become the civil rights battle of this generation PERIOD As an educator who chose the Teach For America path I can say with firsthand knowledge that they are right We as a generation can no longer afford to remain silent about the disparities in academic achievement that exist between lowincome mostly minority students and their middle and upperclass counterparts PERIOD

We have failed to live up to the expectations set forth by Brown v PERIOD Board of Education PERIOD Fiftythree years later our urban and rural schools are in disarray  failing to live up to the expectations of No Child Left Behind failing to attract and retain qualified teachers and failing our students in the quality public education mandated by the Constitution PERIOD

In my southwest Michigan high school by  all of our teachers had an email account and used the Internet to submit attendance PERIOD My science classrooms were equipped with snazzy lab equipment and we were centrifuging DNA and doing electrophoresis in biology PERIOD Our disadvantage was limited to sharing a football field with our cross town rival high school PERIOD

In the Baltimore classroom where I taught  in a building condemned by the Health Department  it took six months to receive a computer for my classroom PERIOD My students werent allowed to do science experiments because of a lack of supplies inadequate teacher training and administration reservations about allowing students near Bunsen burners PERIOD And while we had our own dirt football field the Baltimore police were always present to prevent neighborhood violence PERIOD

The stark difference between my own education and what my students received wasnt limited to resources PERIOD The quality of teachers difficulty of courses and general school and home expectations also contrasted PERIOD My senior students read at a sixthgrade level and I had several students who were essentially illiterate PERIOD When doing SAT practice problems my students needed calculators to perform basic arithmetic PERIOD Only those enrolled in the administrative assistant trade program knew how to type and save documents on floppy disks PERIOD While the majority of my students had postsecondary education aspirations few were prepared for collegelevel work PERIOD Somewhere along the way their teachers schools and community had failed them PERIOD

But things dont have to be this way PERIOD

While the Ivy League schools have increasing percentages of graduates joining Teach For America the University is the largest supplier of Teach for America members PERIOD I encourage you to go to www.teachforamerica.org  and learn more about the organization and the fight for educational justice PERIOD

Most graduate and professional schools and major corporations like JPMorgan allow accepted corps members to defer their schooling or career for the twoyear commitment because they believe in the Teach For America mission and its impact on both our students and corps members PERIOD Leading graduate and professional programs in law medicine business and public policy as well as leading companies like Goldman Sachs Google and Wachovia specifically recruit Teach For America alumni for the same reasons PERIOD Whatever your longterm career interest may be Teach For America is an asset because you gain real world experience and learn firsthand about the challenges of our country PERIOD

Teach For America afforded me the opportunity to see and live the real difference between suburban and urban education PERIOD Before joining it I wasnt sure about my future career interests PERIOD I had majored in English here at the University and only knew that I wanted to make a difference and that not everyone had grown up as I did PERIOD My students have dramatically impacted my life and further deepened my passion to make changes in education PERIOD My experience in Baltimore has fueled the urgency of my current studies in public policy and passion for larger changes PERIOD I felt and fought the injustice in the classroom for two years and am now gaining a new toolset to fight the inequality at the district state and federal levels PERIOD I now ask you to consider doing the same PERIOD
