7711,1970-01-01,"rAMALLAH West Bank  Vowing defiance but facing growing doubts about his future as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat emerged Thursday from the remnants of his shrinking West Bank compound pummeled anew in a morning siege by Israeli troops PERIOD

As Israel mourned the  people who died Monday when a suicide bomber struck a commuter bus in the countrys north Arafat accused Israeli forces of trying to kill him when their tanks and bulldozers responded to the bombing by pounding his Ramallah bedroom home and office complex early Thursday PERIOD

Israeli officials dismissed Arafats charge PERIOD Killing Arafat would have been easy the Israelis say given the collapse of his security services and the overwhelming firepower of the Israeli army PERIOD

More difficult for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is finding a way to decisively sideline a man he insists has neither the will nor the ability to be a reliable partner PERIOD

Sharon has long tried to persuade the Bush administration to abandon Arafat who retains some U.S PERIOD support by virtue of being the Palestinians only elected leader PERIOD With Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak scheduled to meet with President Bush this weekend and Sharon to visit Washington next week Israel is pressing for more leeway to act against Arafat PERIOD

In its sixhour assault on the Ramallah compound a thundering echo of the Israeli army siege that made Arafat a captive from late March until early May Israeli troops and tanks again showed the Palestinian people that they can move at will against the Palestinian Authority leader PERIOD

A dormitory was pummeled into a mountain of concrete and a swirl of white powder PERIOD A gas station was flattened PERIOD Mattresses and bureaus tumbled out of one building PERIOD A small fire was sparked in another PERIOD By the time the thunder of grenades tanks shells and automatic gunfire fell silent around  a.m. six buildings were rubble and one Palestinian intelligence officer was dead PERIOD

If there had been any intention of harming Arafat it would not have been a problem said Capt PERIOD Jacob Dallal an Israeli army spokesman PERIOD

Arafat however again presented himself as a survivor PERIOD

Emerging shortly before  a.m PERIOD to flash a Vforvictory sign with a trembling pale hand Arafat took reporters on a tour of his wreck of a complex PERIOD An Israeli blast had opened a hole in the wall between his bedroom and bathroom and a fine dust covered the quarters PERIOD

I was supposed to sleep here last night but I had some work downstairs Arafat said PERIOD Of course the Israelis knew where I was PERIOD Everybody knows this is my bedroom. arafat has said he would rather die than endure exile and on Thursday he repeated this while examining the damage from the latest Israeli attack on his compound PERIOD Expel me laughed Arafat when asked about it PERIOD I will die here. correspondent Howard Witt contributed

Arafats stature is being battered at home too PERIOD Though Arafat retains stature as a national symbol many Palestinians view his government as corrupt and inept PERIOD Militant groups accuse Arafat of being unable to protect Palestinians against the Israeli army using his weakness as partial justification for their attacks PERIOD

A senior Cabinet minister suggested that expelling Arafat from Israel and the occupied territories had become the least bad alternative and that the idea was gaining support even among moderate politicians PERIOD

Other Israelis including senior security officials contend that Arafat would present more trouble from abroad PERIOD Few Israelis believe that his expulsion would end terror attacks on Israeli civilians PERIOD And by presenting himself as a victim the 72yearold leader could rally international support that now slips with every Palestinian assault PERIOD
