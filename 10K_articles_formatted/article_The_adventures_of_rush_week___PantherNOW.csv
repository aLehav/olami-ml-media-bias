At the beginning of the semester various fraternity and sorority members spoke about their experiences during rush week what they were looking for when they decided to go Greek and why anyone should do it PERIOD

FIU currently offers  fraternity and sorority chapters composed of nearly  members each part of one of four councils Interfraternity Multicultural National PanHellenic and Panhellenic PERIOD

I rushed back in fall  and it was definitely one of the best experiences Ive had while in college said Madison Jimenez member of Phi Sigma Sigma PERIOD

Rush week often takes place during the first quarter of the semester and it is a time where anyone looking to go Greek can attend events hosted by several fraternities and sororities PERIOD

At the end of a rush period Greek houses will place bids on prospective members they think best fit their membership PERIOD Rushees then have one day to make their decision PERIOD

The week itself was very intimidating and nervewracking but the entire time I stayed true to myself PERIOD At the end of the week I found my home she added PERIOD

Carlos Castillo a member of Delta Sigma Phi said he wanted to experience the Greek Life in the United States PERIOD

My home country doesnt have fraternities and I heard a lot of good things about them he said PERIOD
