Molly Dunn a junior majoring in Spanish and Accounting thinks the system while a valid attempt to solve the problem is a little silly. i feel like its all psychosomatic to make people feel like oh I have wristband so I have to behave a certain way she said but they let anyone in  minutes before kickoff. dunn didnt have a wristband so she successfully waited until she could walk in without being stopped and enjoyed the game PERIOD",SGA implements wristband system for students seated in block seating â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
