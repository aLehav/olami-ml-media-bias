The Indiana University of Pennsylvania Counseling Center has created its group counseling schedule for the fall semester PERIOD

There are three groups being offered to students Graduate Students Understanding Yourself and Others and Women Finding Our Way. each group will consist of five to eight students and is led by the counseling center therapists all of whom are either graduate students working toward their doctorate degrees in psychology are counselors or are clinical staff according to Dr PERIOD Rita Drapkin group counseling coordinator PERIOD

While individual counseling is always an option if a student does not feel comfortable discussing certain issues in a group of students group counseling may be more beneficial for some students PERIOD

The Graduate Students group will be facilitated by Drapkin and graduate student Emily Lazar psychology PERIOD This group will meet Tuesdays from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD and will cover issues many graduate students may face such as adjusting to graduate school the coursework demands of graduate school anxieties about competition and career coping with stress graduate school may bring selfcare and healthy interpersonal relationships according to IUPs website PERIOD

Women Finding Our Way is a group for women who may have difficulty developing and maintaining relationships with others PERIOD This group is facilitated by graduate students Abby Costello psychology and Camille Interligi psychology and will be held Wednesdays from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD This will allow students to learn how to express thoughts and feelings and to learn about themselves to better their relationships PERIOD They will also experience giving and receiving support and feedback according to the website PERIOD

Understanding Yourself and Others is open to all students concerned with issues of selfawareness and interpersonal interaction like academics relationships families body image and selfesteem PERIOD This group will take place Thursdays from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m. and is facilitated by graduate student Gabi Huffman psychology and Drapkin according to the website PERIOD

Group counseling has been offered at the university for more than  years and is held during both semesters PERIOD

We offer groups both fall and spring and the groups are not always the same Drapkin said PERIOD

Meeting times for the groups are scheduled during times when there are the fewest number of classes taking place in order to allow all students the opportunity to participate PERIOD The three groups selected for this fall semester were chosen because the Counseling Center staff believes that they will cover most of the needs students may have PERIOD

We try to offer groups that are more likely to run we thought with these three groups we were going to be able to cover most people Drapkin said PERIOD

Drapkin expanded upon the benefits of group counseling PERIOD

Theres a lot of research that shows that some groups are more effective than individual counseling Drapkin said PERIOD

Students wishing to participate in the groups are required to set up an initial meeting with the group facilitators in order to see which group will suit them best PERIOD These initial meetings take up to  minutes and can be scheduled by contacting the counseling center as soon as possible PERIOD

The initial meeting is held to decide which group will best suit the students needs and if there is not a group for them they are encouraged to either schedule individual counseling sessions or return next semester to see if there is a new group better suited for them PERIOD

Its a twoway meeting Drapkin said PERIOD Were trying to learn about them and they are trying to learn about us. once students complete the initial meeting and are placed in groups they are encouraged to appear to their meeting weekly PERIOD

These counseling groups are closed groups which means once the meetings begin no additional student may be permitted into the group PERIOD

This is done in order for students to develop trust among each other and to reduce anxiety levels according to Drapkin PERIOD
