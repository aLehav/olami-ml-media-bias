Adorned with red and black arm bands allies of the black solidarity movement gathered on the quad Wednesday for a Love and Solidarity rally PERIOD Students and faculty organizations read statements of support for the Black Lives Matter movement and black students faculty and community members PERIOD

The event began with a statement from the host of the event Kristina Khan and a rallying chant of Black Lives Matter. one speaker outlined the history of white supremacy and white student union organizations at the University PERIOD

From  until at least the 1920s possibly later there existed an officially recognized Ku Klux Klan group here at UIUC he said PERIOD Their pictures were in the yearbook thats how accepted it was. the original White Student Union that an anonymous coward created two weeks ago should be treated as a terrorist organization he said PERIOD They should not be given any platform whatsoever to organize and spread their ideology. people attending the rally were encouraged to write their own Love Letters that will used in an antiracism art display that will debuted in the Spring PERIOD

Members from several organizations across campus then stood and presented their messages of support with black solidarity and the advocation for the Universitys black community PERIOD A reading of the love letters written by students and members of the community followed the statements PERIOD



Among the organizations present were the ChampaignUrbana Chapter for Showing Up For Racial Justice the Ethnic Studies Union Amnesty International and Standing With Her PERIOD

One of the things that white students need to do the most  is come get our cousins said Stephanie Skora senior in LAS and member of the Women of Pride and the Campus Union for Trans Equality and Support PERIOD What this means is that even though you may be here as a white ally in support of racial justice where are your friends where is your roommate do the people in your classes know that this is happening

Charlotte Prieu a graduate student in LAS drew portraits of black students and faculty to show her support PERIOD Prieu said that there are many different ways students can show their support for black lives PERIOD

There are other things you can do  show support show solidarity she said PERIOD Its not that hard even if you dont know all the concepts about white supremacy white privilege. as a white student I have a lot of privilege and Im afforded a lot of life chances by my whiteness Skora said PERIOD I feel like one of the best things that I can do  is to come out to speak to other white people and to say we as white people have to support black students and have to support black revolution and we have to use our privilege to amplify their voices. allies and supporters of the movement were disappointed with the way University administrators handled the Illini White Student Union Facebook page PERIOD

A lot of departments didnt put a statement out and I think the racism that was shown by the people who started page and then those who wrote on it  departments should have addressed that Prieu said PERIOD It should have been talked about in classrooms they should have sent emails they should show that they condemned what happened. skora said that she felt the actions of Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson and Interim Provost Edward Feser were not aggressive enough in the face of threats against black students at the University PERIOD

I think Barb Wilson and Ed Feser need to step up she said PERIOD They may be interim chancellors and provosts but they have the real power of those jobs and they need to take the demands of Black Students for Revolution seriously when they release them. emailprotected","Students, faculty gather for love and solidarity rally - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
