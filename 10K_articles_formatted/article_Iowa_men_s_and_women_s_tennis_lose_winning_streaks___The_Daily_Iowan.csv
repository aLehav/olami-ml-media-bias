In four matches this weekend Iowa mens and womens tennis were only able to come out of the weekend with one win PERIOD The womens team went  at the Hawkeye Tennis and Recreation Complex and the men dropped both matches on the road PERIOD

The Hawkeye womens team beat Penn State on Friday  for its fifth straight win but lost two days later to No PERIOD  Ohio State  PERIOD The men lost both matches with a  defeat against No PERIOD  Illinois and a  loss to No PERIOD  Northwestern PERIOD

Freshman Alexa Noel and senior Elise van Heuvelen Treadwell were the only players to come out of the weekend with two singles wins and the Summit New Jersey native remains undefeated with  wins PERIOD

I just go out there and play my own game van Heuvelen Treadwell said PERIOD I just stuck to the game plan stayed confident throughout the match and got the job done. noel is now  against ranked opponents after her  win against No PERIOD  Irina Cantos Siemers PERIOD

The womens tennis team has struggled with depth this season with Noel and van Heuvelen Treadwell providing the only signs of consistency PERIOD Iowa is  at No PERIOD   at No PERIOD  and have not won a single match this season at No PERIOD  PERIOD

This weekend was the same story as junior Samantha Gillas lost both matches at the No PERIOD  spot freshman Vipasha Mehra went winless at No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  and junior Michelle Bacalla went  at the bottom two spots PERIOD

We just need to be able to dig in in more singles matches at all positions Iowa head womens tennis coach Sasha Schmid said PERIOD Especially in situations where were not dominating or we dont have the lead PERIOD The ability to turn some matches is going to be a defining characteristic. rELATEDTough tests lie ahead for Iowa mens and womens tennis

The Hawkeyes are undefeated this season when they win the doubles point and have only one win when they lose it PERIOD

The No PERIOD  pair of Gillas and van Heuvelen Treadwell won both matches this weekend and the Danielle BauersMehra pair sealed the point for the Hawkeyes on Friday PERIOD The Hawks came up short in doubles on Sunday though as Bauers and Mehra lost  and NoelSamantha Mannix were shut out PERIOD

I think the doubles point is incredibly crucial Schmid said PERIOD So that is something that we have to continue to keep working on PERIOD To play a top team and feel like you can be competitive and get a doubles point is huge. like the womens team the Iowa mens tennis team came into the weekend hungry to get its first win against a ranked opponent PERIOD

Even with crucial wins from No PERIOD  Will DaviesOliver Okonkwo on Friday and Saturday Iowa lost the doubles point in both matches as Kareem AllafNikita Snezhko and Joe TylerPeter Alam couldnt follow up the stellar play of their teammates PERIOD

Singles was not any better for the Hawkeyes as they were completely shut out on all singles courts against Illinois on Friday PERIOD

No PERIOD  Kareem Allaf lost his undefeated season with a   loss to No PERIOD  Aleks Kovacevic PERIOD

Juniors Joe Tyler and Will Davies and sophomore Oliver Okonkwo all took their first conference losses PERIOD

Sunday was no better for the men against the Wildcats PERIOD After losing the doubles point Will Davies was the only Iowa player to sneak out a win in singles with the rest of the Hawkeyes dropping their matches PERIOD
