Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



TOST and Turned a nonprofit theater group made up entirely of students performed three studentwritten and studentdirected oneact plays over the weekend PERIOD

The event was held in Pratt Auditorium where the group usually performs PERIOD The group is performing again Friday and Saturday at  p.m PERIOD in Pratt Auditorium PERIOD

Performing for the sake of performance is not all that TOST and Turned has to offer however PERIOD The groups performances are free to attend but donations are accepted at the door that benefit a local charity of the groups choosing PERIOD

TOST and Turneds Vice President Devin Gray junior mathematics and economics who also wrote directed and acted for this weekends performance said the group prefers donating to local charities such as the Alice Paul House or Four Footed Friends as opposed to nationally recognized organizations like United Way or Goodwill PERIOD

We like helping out the smaller charities because they might not get as much help as something like the Salvation Army Gray said PERIOD

Gray also said TOST and Turneds performances are unique opportunities to experience theater for someone unfamiliar with staged performances PERIOD

You can come out for free and donate if you want to but you wont end up having to pay  to see something you might not like he said PERIOD

Gray said TOST and Turned also provides a way for students who are interested in acting to perform without majoring in theater or dedicating huge amounts of time to more complex productions PERIOD

Mike Van Etten freshman natural sciencepremed an actor in the third play of the afternoon Sibling Rivalry said TOST and Turned is an opportunity to express himself in a unique way PERIOD

I like getting onstage and not being myself Van Etten said PERIOD

The performance lasted just under an hour and consisted of three plays PERIOD

Short skits written by Samantha Barnhart freshman English were performed before and after each play PERIOD

The skits took place from the perspective of a group of typical household pets and served as comical breaths of air between the distinct plots of the three plays PERIOD

The first play  Til the Cows Come Home written by Barnhart  was a humorous take on misplaced identity where a man who has recently lost his job and his girlfriend assumes the identity of a bovine named Ishtan Bull through method acting PERIOD

The second play calledHeightened Expectations and written by Gray took place in a doctors office and focused on a failed M.D. his blind secretary and his attempt to provide adequate care to an injured football player with limited knowledge of medicine PERIOD

Sibling Rivalry the third and final play was also written by Gray and is centered on two dueling beings implied to be a devil and an angel who meddle in a romantic moment between two mortals PERIOD Needless to say high jinks ensue PERIOD

All of the afternoons performances were light comical and fun PERIOD Next weekend The Abridged San Francisco Trilogy another studentwrittendirected play written by Ian Bright sophomore mathematics will also be performed PERIOD

The group is open to new membership from any IUP student with auditions taking place at the beginning of each semester PERIOD TOST and Turned also accepts script submissions from any student PERIOD
