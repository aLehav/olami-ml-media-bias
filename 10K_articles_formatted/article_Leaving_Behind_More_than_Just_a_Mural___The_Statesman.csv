Remember Me



Just a few months ago the hallway outside of the University Bookstore in the Melville Library could be summed up in two words white cinderblock PERIOD

Now the wall is full of color PERIOD Painted books including the childhood favorite Where the Wild Things Are and Alice Walkers literary classic The Color Purple are neatly wedged between painted red bricks. arches evenly spaced throughout the bricks and books show different university traditions and landmarks PERIOD One painting shows unique boats floating in the Roth pond for the yearly regatta and another shows the sun setting over the Student Activities Center PERIOD

These bricks books and arches are part of a mural that was created by art students over the summer PERIOD The mastermind of the project is a soon to be graduating senior Sophia Dang PERIOD

I really appreciate that everyone can see this Dang said PERIOD Its not in some gallery where it will be stored away PERIOD It will be here forever. dang an art history and studio art double major was selected to head the project due to her experience painting murals in New York City PERIOD Her past experience not only got her involved in creating the mural at Stony Brook but also convinced her of a need for an art education a few years ago PERIOD

Born and raised in Sunset Park in Brooklyn New York Dang always loved to draw and paint PERIOD At age  she moved with her parents and younger brother to Coney Island and attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn PERIOD She was never able to take art classes but in the summer of  after her high school graduation Dang was introduced to art on a large scale PERIOD

Dang started out working for Groundswell a community nonprofit mural organization based in Brooklyn PERIOD Dang was assigned to a group within Groundswell called Voices Herd which focuses on art that addresses social issues affecting women PERIOD That summer Dang and  others in the group created a mural focusing on art being a vehicle for social change PERIOD The mural entitled Art Builds Community and Community Creates Change now stands five stories high on the side of a building on eighteenth Street and sixth Avenue in Brooklyn PERIOD

Its using art not just to show people that we can paint or say thats a pretty picture Dang said PERIOD But it shows that art can actually say something and address issues that people might not talk about or that people are dealing with but cant really address. when the summer was over Dang entered Stony Brook as a freshman taking biology and chemistry classes PERIOD After some large lecture style classes and some poor grades Dang decided to take an introductory level drawing class and an art history class PERIOD After thoroughly enjoying her second semester at Stony Brook Dang went back to Voices Herd to continue to work in the summer of  PERIOD

It was that summer when Dang realized her true love for art PERIOD She worked with Voices Herd on a mural at twenty-third Street and third Avenue located on the side of the BrooklynQueens Expressway in Brooklyn PERIOD This mural was based around female veterans in the war in Iraq PERIOD

When I worked on this mural I realized that this was a really powerful way to show people what others are thinking not just yourself Dang said PERIOD Its almost like youre speaking for those who dont have the ability to speak for themselves. dang returned to Stony Brook in the fall of  and switched her major to studio art and declared art history and business minors PERIOD She began delving into her major requirements and took her first classes in ceramics and sculpture PERIOD It was here that she met ceramics Professor Nabuho Nagasawa PERIOD This was also the semester wherein Dang decided to transfer out of Stony Brook PERIOD

In order to pursue a serious career in art Dang decided to transfer to New York University PERIOD She said that she wanted a school that was more focused on the arts PERIOD

I picked up everything and left Dang said PERIOD

Her transfer did not last long however after she received an offer for a position as a resident assistant back at Stony Brook Dang transferred back before classes even started PERIOD

When she returned to Stony Brook she changed her art history minor to a major and added a digital art minor PERIOD Shes been back at Stony Brook for almost two years now and knows what she wants to do PERIOD Many were happy to see her return PERIOD

As much as I think its great for the student to be in the city and to have that extra excitement of being in the city and going to the exhibitions I was so excited to see that she was back and chose us to be the school she would graduate from Nagasawa said PERIOD So when she signed up for the class I thought OK this is wonderful. dang says shes come full circle PERIOD Shell be leaving Stony Brook next spring but will leave behind a mural the kind of project that got her interested in art in the first place PERIOD

Im ending my studies here with something that I can leave behind on a wall for everyone to see Dang said PERIOD And I think the people who have worked on it too theyre people that Ive met along the way and its something that we worked on together and it connects us. nagasawa says that Dang has grown tremendously since she came back to Stony Brook PERIOD According to Nagasawa Dang started with great potential as a shy AsianAmerican student. now she will be graduating but leaving behind more than just the mural PERIOD

I hope the people who worked with her will also have some experience that I think is in a way is more than the actual artwork said Nagasawa PERIOD Its an experience of working together and overcoming difficulties and communication issues PERIOD And I hope that kind of experience is going to be carried on through the people that worked with her PERIOD I think thats the most important thing. one of Dangs art history professors Rhonda Cooper has known Dang since she was a freshman which is when she began working as an intern in the art gallery PERIOD Cooper says she hopes Dang pursues her masters in fine arts and says Dang would make an inspiring art professor. though Dang doesnt know what postgraduation will bring she knows someone will have to pick up where she started with the mural at Stony Brook which now spans only part of the hallway PERIOD The hope for the finished product would be for the mural to extend the full length of the wall and include other events and landmarks from Stony Brooks history PERIOD
