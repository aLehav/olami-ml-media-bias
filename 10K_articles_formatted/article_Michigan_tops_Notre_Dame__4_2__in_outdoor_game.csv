SOUTH BEND Ind PERIOD  Putting the puck on net has been routine for the Michigan hockey team PERIOD

The team is second in the nation for shots on goal per game and ranks third in total shots PERIOD So when senior defenseman Joseph Cecconi sent the puck toward the net from the defensive zone five minutes into Saturdays game against Notre Dame nothing was out of sorts PERIOD

The play a shot that looked to be a pass from the opposite blue line miraculously went in against previous Mike Richter award winner Fighting Irish goaltender Cale Morris PERIOD It was unintentional by all means PERIOD Cecconi had only anticipated an icing pass down ice going as far as telling junior Jake Slaker to go for the breakaway right before the play PERIOD

But instead the goal was scored and in turn lit the spark in a team that had spent the majority of the game defending its own zone and sent the Wolverines on their way to a  win PERIOD

We got a break PERIOD We havent been getting many breaks to this point said Michigan coach Mel Pearson PERIOD So that first goal is a huge break for us PERIOD Got us off to a good start. fifteen seconds after Cecconis goal another one was scored this time by junior forward Will Lockwood PERIOD Getting the puck in neutral ice Lockwood skated ahead pursued by only a single defender PERIOD He kept the puck at sticks length protecting it from the probing stick of the Fighting Irish defender PERIOD Slinging it as he cut parallel to the goal Lockwood placed the puck out of Morris reach PERIOD

Hes a talented player Pearson said of Lockwood PERIOD He did that on purpose he goes across flips it over his stick continues on gets it and thats a place to shoot PERIOD He shot  hes got the goalie going right to left and shoots it back to the right PERIOD Hes a goal scorer. for a brief moment momentum was on in Michigans favor PERIOD A proceeding interference penalty one that was necessary to stop a dangerous opportunity for Notre Dame was called on junior defenseman Luke Martin after he pulled a player to the ice to prevent a shot PERIOD

Sophomore forward Dakota Raabe drew a tripping penalty during the Fighting Irish power play to make it fouronfour PERIOD After both penalties expired Raabe found freshman forward Nolan Moyle for a topshelf overtheshoulder shot that pinged off the crossbar and into the goal for Michigans third of the period PERIOD

Raabe made a really good hardworking play and a headsup play and kinda got me in a soft area and I just shot it Moyle said PERIOD I closed my eyes I didnt even know it was in at first but it did. a penalty problem developed early in the second period for the Wolverines PERIOD As Pearson noted the only real problem in the game was getting backtoback penalties to start the period PERIOD

The first one was fended off with a breakaway attempt by senior forward Brendan Warren after a series of good poke checks PERIOD The second committed immediately after the first ended resulted in a goal PERIOD

Junior goaltender Hayden Lavigne was occupied with a screener PERIOD The Notre Dame skater was fighting for position in front of the net and blocking Lavignes view from the outside slap shot that found the bottom of the net PERIOD

The rest of the periods ended in both teams trading shots PERIOD Each opportunity resulted in a miss or saved shot however with suffocating defense and goaltending from both sides PERIOD

The beginning of the third period mirrored the end of the second PERIOD Michigan dominated the shots on goal but both sides got equal share of threatening possessions PERIOD Sophomore forward Michael Pastujov got the puck in a scoring position before being tripped by a Fighting Irish skater resulting in the Wolverines second power play of the game PERIOD

The power play resulted in dangerous chances but lacked the finish touches to convert the man advantage into a goal PERIOD Michigan saw increasingly more breakaway chances taken away by Morris each time PERIOD

Martin got called for the interference with a little under five minutes to go PERIOD With a twogoal deficit Notre Dame opted to pull the goalie early for a sixonfour advantage PERIOD The Fighting Irish failed to score a goal as the penalty expired but chose to stick with the empty net PERIOD

The decision paid off PERIOD

A faceoff loss in the defensive zone for Michigan resulted in a goal for Notre Dame PERIOD The faceoff win allowed the players to pass right out to a readied Alex Steeves positioned directly behind the circle PERIOD A quick flick of the wrist and the deficit was shortened to one for the Fighting Irish PERIOD

However the depth of the Wolverines who were down two players due to World Junior Championships paid its dividends PERIOD

Raabe who had defended aggressively all night secured the puck and put the game away with an empty net goal to put the game away PERIOD

We have a lot of guys on our team that can play hockey Cecconi said PERIOD We have a lot of depth and the guys we brought in to replace those guys were unbelievable. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
