NASHVILLE Tenn PERIOD  An 11game losing streak that spanned  years crumbled Saturday PERIOD

The Alabama mens basketball team had not won in Memorial Gymnasium since  but the Crimson Tide fought hard and fought back to defeat the Vanderbilt Commodores PERIOD

The Tides victory at Vanderbilt was the first since Wimp Sanderson led his team to a  win on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

I couldnt be prouder of our team head coach Anthony Grant said PERIOD This was a big road win for us PERIOD We all know the history of this series PERIOD The University of Alabamas last win here was in  and were happy for our team and our players as well as all the players that came before these guys PERIOD Im not trying to overdramatize it but it was important to us to come in here and play well today. it was more than a win for Alabama PERIOD It showed the Tide had the ability to fight through adversity and road struggles PERIOD

Vanderbilt shot . percent  from the field and . percent  from behind the arc in the first half PERIOD The Commodores were more than on fire and every time Alabama made a run Vanderbilt hit a timely three PERIOD

Vanderbilt   SEC led by as many as  points  with  remaining PERIOD But Alabama went on a  run taking its first lead of the contest when Trevor Lacey hit a three point shot with  seconds left to make the score  PERIOD Lacey finished with  points including nine in the last five minutes PERIOD

Alabama closed the game on an  run over the final seven minutes and made clutch free throws to seal the deal PERIOD

I thought the fight in the second half the resiliency was awesome Grant said PERIOD Andrew Steele our senior did a tremendous job throughout the game keeping our guys focused and motivated and ontask in terms of what we needed to do PERIOD We always talk about it being a 40minute game that we have to play stay the course and play all the way through. steele a fifthyear senior who had lost here twice carried Alabama offensively along with Lacey PERIOD Steele made three clutch three pointers to keep Alabama close and fuel the Tides second half run PERIOD But his biggest contribution came during every huddle PERIOD

I tried to tell them to keep fighting Steele who scored a seasonhigh  points said PERIOD At every media timeout we had cut the lead by a certain margin PERIOD I just kept reminding them Just chip away chip away. we kept chipping away PERIOD  I had full confidence that we would win the game PERIOD I didnt know how it would come about but not for one second did our team stop believing that we would get the win. the Crimson Tide   SEC will next be in action Feb PERIOD  when it travels to take on the Auburn Tigers PERIOD Tipoff is slated for  p.m PERIOD and will be televised on the SEC Network PERIOD
