But let me first admit Im a nonbeliever PERIOD While I seriously respect Tupacs music and especially his poetic lyricism Ive always been baffled by the hysterical admiration of him PERIOD I may be a proud California girl but I generally prefer the more hardhitting sound of East Coast hiphop to the West Coast scene so Tupac never became a favorite of mine PERIOD

With that said I can see how the lore surrounding his image  and especially his death  has led to an almost religious fervor for the artist PERIOD The cover of his first album released posthumously and the last one he recorded alive The Don Killuminati The  Day Theory sometimes called Makaveli depicts Shakur on the cross in an attempt to convey his crucifixion by the media implying to many of his fans a literal resurrection after his death PERIOD

Released so soon after he passed away the strange title of the album gave conspiracy theorists and fanatics something to pore over  a reference to Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli who wrote about faking ones own death in the book The Art Of War. apparently Tupac read Machiavellis work extensively while in jail in  leading many to believe the reference is a sign that Tupac has indeed faked his own death and will one day return PERIOD In other words he will eventually be resurrected like Jesus PERIOD

In all likelihood the reference to Machiavelli simply appealed to the constant threat of death Tupac experienced in the gangsta lifestyle and is not the key to Tupacs secret hideout in Cuba or to a religious zeitgeist in which the rapper must await the rapture PERIOD But what is resurrection if not the ability to live on after death Within the hiphop community Tupac is immortalized years after his murder just as Jesus was immortalized by humanity after his crucifixion PERIOD Isnt that enough

Not exactly PERIOD Even though Im not the biggest Tupac fan I am a fan of justice PERIOD I want peace of mind for Tupacs mama PERIOD I want answers PERIOD I want to find the killer PERIOD

Now I dont usually believe in conspiracy theories but there is one I hold to be true Diddy is behind Tupacs death PERIOD I can feel it PERIOD Duane Keffe D Keith Davis a shot caller for the Southside Crips told the Los Angeles Police Department that Sean Diddy Combs  then known as Puff Daddy crosscountry rival of Tupacs label Death Row Records  commissioned Shakurs legendary murder in Vegas in September  PERIOD Davis himself claims he was offered  million to kill Tupac and Suge Knight Death Rows former CEO who survived the ultimate shooting by Keffe Ds nephew Orlando Anderson PERIOD

But despite this obvious evidence against him you still might wonder if Diddy is really capable of murder in the first place PERIOD And Ill admit he probably isnt PERIOD But he probably is capable of being a murder conspirator PERIOD I think of Combs like the mob boss of the hiphop game a cold businessman calling all the shots literally and not taking any himself PERIOD Dont let his newfangled innocence sway you  he built the crucifix for a hiphop Jesus PERIOD
