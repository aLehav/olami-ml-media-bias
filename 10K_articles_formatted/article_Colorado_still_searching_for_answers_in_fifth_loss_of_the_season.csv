5222,2021-10-24,"head coach Karl Dorrell challenges a controversial call during the fourth quarter PERIOD Oct PERIOD   PERIOD Kara WagenknechtCU Independent

After an offensive explosion against Arizona last weekend the Buffs returned to typical fashion as their offense struggled to pose any threat and they lost in another Pac12 matchup against the California Golden Bears with a score of  PERIOD Head coach Karl Dorrell has led this Colorado team to a  start while holding a  record in interconference play PERIOD Dorrell discussed the struggles that CU faced against California PERIOD

That wasnt the type of game I was expecting at all Dorrell said PERIOD I think we struggled in the first half on both sides of the ball PERIOD Unfortunately we didnt play to our capabilities today PERIOD We had a great week of practice PERIOD I felt we were going to play our best football but it didnt happen today. the Buffaloes scored just  points in the entire game resulting in Colorados three scoreless quarters PERIOD They could only amass  total yards on offense throughout the game where only  of those yards came in the second half PERIOD Freshman quarterback Brendon Lewis could only lead his offense to a total of  first downs compared to Californias  PERIOD

Although freshman wide receiver Brenden Rice could only accumulate one reception for six yards he showed some potential at the kick returner as he could take one of his two returns back for  yards PERIOD Rice explained what the mindset of each player should be going forward PERIOD

If youre not bought in you might as well just leave Rice said PERIOD Theres no room for anybody whos trying to be out or trying to excuse themselves from the team PERIOD We need to all be bought in for us to take the next step. the only source of the silenced production for the Buffaloes offense came from junior tailback Jarek Broussard PERIOD Once Cals defense was able to show they could prevent the run holding Broussard to just  yards on  carries Broussard was able to offer his duelthreat ability by recording  receiving yards with three receptions PERIOD After these  touches in the first half Broussard failed to record a touch in the second half of the game PERIOD Rice mentioned how the attitude within the team needs to change for future games PERIOD

People are too nice Rice said PERIOD People are way too nice and thats all going to change this week PERIOD Its not the coaches PERIOD It starts with the players PERIOD Its time to take that next step. colorados defense wasnt dreadful although allowing  points in the first half while carrying a sluggish offense wasnt exactly the expected game plan heading into Saturdays game PERIOD Junior linebacker Nate Landman hit a career milestone as he became the sixth player in CU history to record  career tackles when he made his first tackle on the second play of the game PERIOD Despite Landmans achievement CU struggled throughout all four quarters of the game PERIOD Junior cornerback Mekhi Blackmon explained what the issue was on the defensive side of the ball PERIOD

We always preach to start fast but I feel like we didnt start fast today PERIOD Thats something we have to work on more in practice Blackmon said PERIOD I dont know if it is nerves or what but we all have to start stepping up and have things clicking better on both sides of the ball PERIOD Its not just the offense PERIOD We the defense gave up the points not the offense. their goal was to stop California wide receiver Nikko Remigio who leads the Bears with  receptions this season including a pair of touchdowns PERIOD Remigio was also Californias leading receiver in  with  catches for  yards and three touchdowns which could explain his performance in this one as he and teammate Trevon Clark led Cal in receptions with four each against Colorado PERIOD

The Colorado Buffaloes will take on the number  ranked Oregon Ducks in Eugene Oregon next Saturday Oct PERIOD thirtieth PERIOD Oregon who is  this season with an innerconference record of  sits at the top of the Pac12 standings PERIOD
