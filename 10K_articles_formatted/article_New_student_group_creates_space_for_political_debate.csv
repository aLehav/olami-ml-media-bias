5411,2017-05-22,"a new student group called theStanford Political Union SPU debuted this spring with the goal of fostering critical debate between students and experts holding different political views PERIOD The leaders of SPU aim to create an outlet where every voice can be heard PERIOD

All debaters students and professors are sitting at the same table on equal footing to debate these national issues said Steven Jiang  cochair of SPU PERIOD

The creators of SPU saythe last presidential election emphasized the need for open dialogue on campus PERIOD

We have seen many of these discussions devolve into partisan echo chambers often lacking critical thinking on the actual policies Jiang said PERIOD That is what really concerned us. sPUs first event last month centered on whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act ACA commonly known as Obamacare PERIOD Lanhee Chen research fellow at the Hoover Institution joined Wayne and Jodi Cooperman Professor Mark Duggan at the Bechtel International Center to discuss theACA PERIOD Both Chen and Duggan have significant political experience Chen served as senior advisor for Marco Rubios  campaign and Mitt Romneys  presidential bid while Duggan was former President Barack Obamas senior economist for healthcare policy PERIOD

Students Justin Hsuan  and Schyler Cole  also participated in the debate with the two experts PERIOD Following the debate the four took questions from the audience PERIOD

I appreciated that format where the people in the audience could see the baselevel arguments from me and Schyler and then the slightly less accessible but academic and datadriven arguments that the experts put forward Hsuan said PERIOD To have both kinds of arguments up there for people to hear and evaluate for themselves was very useful. cole added that although she initially questioned her role in a debate with experts she now acknowledges the value in her student perspective on the topic of healthcare PERIOD

In particular I was able to speak about women and minority and lowincome concerns because that is something that I was able to witness growing up Cole noted PERIOD

The leaders of SPU were shocked by the number of students and outside visitors that filled the seats at the event PERIOD

I was happy and surprised to see how enthusiastic the audience was to press the student speakers and experts with nuanced questions about the policies said Zoe Himwich  cochair of SPU PERIOD

Hsuan appreciated the opportunity for a student to debate two policy professors on stage PERIOD

To be able to say that I was able to hold my own up there for an hour and a half in a policy debate with two of the most knowledgeable professors on campus is something that Im going to remember for a long time Hsuan said PERIOD

The coordinators of SPU events aim to make audience questions a significant basis for the expert discussion in their next event on May  titled The Economic Impact of Artificial Intelligence. we are hoping that this event will be relevant to a lot of people as Stanford students continue to develop and use new technologies that have the capacity to replace workers Himwich said PERIOD We hope to hear debate over what the moral and socioeconomic effects of that change would be. jiang remarked that for future events the leaders of SPU aim to present experts from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science professors and offcampus professionals  for example venture capitalists and executives in the Bay Area PERIOD

Another topic that we have considered presenting in the future is the debate over sanctuary campuses Himwich said referencing an unsuccessful movement to officially dub the University a safehaven for undocumented immigrants PERIOD There would be a lot of opinions especially given that the University turned down the Sanctuary Now petition. jiang added that it may be valuable to present the perspectives of professors in the Law School who worked on the petition as well as opinions from students affected by the issue on campus PERIOD

Moving forward SPUscreatorsaim to hold not only these formal largescale events but also more frequent smallscale debates within the club over national issues PERIOD Members of SPU hope to to expand members involvement beyond eventplanning as SPU begins to recruit students next year Himwich stated PERIOD

Its important for people to have detailed and thorough reasoning for why they hold their convictions Himwich said PERIOD We hope this can help students think critically about their opinions and have a place to voice their views openly on campus. contact Claudia Pacheco at chapstic at stanford.edu PERIOD
