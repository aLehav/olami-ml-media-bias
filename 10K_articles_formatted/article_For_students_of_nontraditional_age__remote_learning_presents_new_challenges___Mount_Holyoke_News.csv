J.J PERIOD DiPietro left behind a different life when she chose to return to college as a nontraditionally aged student in  PERIOD She enrolled at Holyoke Community College for two years before moving to South Hadley MA and enrolling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst PERIOD For DiPietro the switch to online learning during the COVID19 pandemic was a welcome change PERIOD Her two small dogs privatelyowned cleaning business and general responsibilities of being an adult in college all benefited from the extra time spent at home PERIOD When UMass shifted to hybrid inperson and online learning this semester though DiPietro realized she was expected to travel to campus and participate in inperson events far more than she felt comfortable with PERIOD

Living  minutes from campus with a relatively rigid schedule she found it hard to keep up with twiceweekly student testing and her professors were slow to communicate about required inperson activities PERIOD Now DiPietro feels uncomfortable returning to campus due to the recent COVID19 outbreak among students and shes found that faculty and administration are less flexible than previously during the pandemic PERIOD

Very few of the professors are even giving extensions and more take the stance of you know If you just cant do it you need to drop the class she explained PERIOD

DiPietro is taking a hybrid mechanical engineering lab this semester PERIOD The course is a 300level meaning its mostly made up of upperclass students PERIOD In order to comply with the social distancing measures outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the students were split into several sets of partners this semester PERIOD Only six pairs are allowed inside the lab at any given time and each is expected to attend three inperson lab sessions throughout the semester PERIOD

Aside from those three sessions DiPietro will remain in her offcampus housing for the entire semester PERIOD Living in South Hadley shes roughly  miles from campus which adds up to a travel time of  minutes by car and  minutes by public transportation PERIOD Despite this distance and plans to stay off campus DiPietro is still required to make the trek twice weekly in order to get tested and uphold the UMass student contract PERIOD



Remote learning inperson parenting

Robin Gencarelle a senior and nontraditionally aged student at UMass has run into a similar issue while living offcampus PERIOD She lives in Easthampton  a few miles further from campus than South Hadley  and is taking no inperson classes this semester PERIOD As a painting major her coursework generally doesnt require a trip to campus since there are no labs or collaborative requirements on her syllabi PERIOD Still she says that the universitys communication has been limited and slow in the wake of recent offcampus outbreaks PERIOD To Gencarelle it can feel unsafe to enter the campus community to receive testing because of its high case numbers PERIOD

There were frats having parties PERIOD And then there were like  people that tested positive in a weekend she explained referring to a significant February on and offcampus outbreak PERIOD So we had to get shut down for two weeks PERIOD And then we just reopened and they want us to go get tested twice a week PERIOD  Its a half an hour one way PERIOD So thats two hours a week that I would have to spend driving to get tested PERIOD I cant do that. gencarelle is a single parent to a 5yearold daughter who is currently attending hybrid online and inperson kindergarten PERIOD Its pretty much impossible to do things with her around PERIOD I love her to death but she just needs a lot of attention Gencarelle said PERIOD She gets a lot of anxiety. gencarelles course schedule does not line up with her daughters kindergarten classes either which can result in her joining in on college lectures demanding to be held while Gencarelle is giving presentations and otherwise needing attention at inopportune times PERIOD Professors have been generally understanding and lenient about this and learning from home has been largely beneficial for Gencarelle PERIOD For her being remote means being able to shift her schedule around her daughters needs with a quick email PERIOD

But in her last semester at UMass Gencarelle is unable to stay completely off campus PERIOD She is currently writing a thesis which requires her to meet in person with committee members PERIOD

Working from her twobedroom apartment and with only an iPhone for a camera she says that its impossible to accurately photograph her work for her professors PERIOD So every so often when an adviser asks to meet Gencarelle loads her artwork and supplies into her car to drive to campus  after testing negative through the university PERIOD

DiPietro believes that this testing requirement makes sense for students living on campus or in the immediate vicinity but is potentially dangerous for students like herself who are living farther away PERIOD For her it would be easier to learn from a fully remote setting in which she would not have to expose herself to public transportation or the campus community PERIOD



Hybrid learning complicates inperson participation

For students living off campus at UMass missing COVID19 tests can have drastic consequences PERIOD

If we were not in compliance and we missed a green check where we werent getting tested twice a week  we were gonna have Moodle access denied DiPietro explained PERIOD Its where we get all of our information where we submit our homework assignments and quizzes and everything. after one of DiPietros gender studies professors heard that the college intended to restrict Moodle access for offcampus students who did not get tested twice weekly she chose to take matters into her own hands PERIOD

She thinks its crazy DiPietro explained PERIOD The testing requirement overlooks marginalized members of our community people who are less able to get in and be tested people who dont live on campus PERIOD  She ended up giving us her guest passwords on Moodle just in case we had Moodle access removed. diPietro agrees  leaving her quarantine bubble and entering the campus community just to receive a COVID19 test can feel counterintuitive when she would otherwise stay at home PERIOD

Gencarelle on the other hand feels relatively safe with the rate at which she is required to visit campus PERIOD Whats more difficult is her daughters kindergarten schedule in Easthampton which is currently operating one week on one week off in half days PERIOD The schedule is confusing for her daughter who needs a more consistent routine to fully succeed according to Gencarelle PERIOD

While her professors at UMass have been understanding about Gencarelles position as a single parent her schedule has been altered to accommodate her daughters schedule multiple times PERIOD She handles dropoffs and pickups meals online classes visits with her childs father parentteacher conferences and the daytoday needs of her child which pushes her schoolwork down on her list of responsibilities PERIOD

Often Gencarelle finds herself working on detailed paintings in her spare bedroom in the middle of the night after her daughter goes to sleep PERIOD

I feel like I can figure my stuff out PERIOD And if I have any issues I can talk to my professors Gencarelle explained PERIOD But the pressure of her constantly changing schedule coupled with worries about her daughters socialization is a difficult weight to bear PERIOD

The instability of UMass schedule has been complicated for other nontraditionally aged students as well PERIOD A few weeks ago DiPietro ran into trouble when her mechanical engineering professor announced on a Friday afternoon that her group would be in person in the lab the following Tuesday PERIOD I  got an email the Friday before the Tuesday that we were supposed to have the lab  Friday at  p.m PERIOD  from my professors saying you know Were not virtual anymore she explained PERIOD Next week we are going to be meeting facetoface and if you cant make it withdraw from the class DiPietro recounted PERIOD

She was unable to get tested that weekend PERIOD UMass COVID19 testing program is closed from  p.m PERIOD Friday through the weekend PERIOD Even if DiPietro had driven to campus the moment she received the email she would have been unlikely to receive a test that day PERIOD If she went on Monday she was unsure that results would come back in time PERIOD Your test results will be ready in  to  hours the universitys COVID19 testing program webpage reads PERIOD

Still DiPietro was expected to attend class that Tuesday PERIOD A lot of people did go to the lab she explained PERIOD Between the snowstorm that passed through that day her uncertainty about being properly tested and the short notice of her inperson requirement she chose not to attend the lab session PERIOD I mean its just something I couldnt do she said PERIOD I thought Well what if I had had you know tested positive They wouldnt have let me make up the lab. instead she emailed her adviser a dean and the chancellor hoping to secure an excuse for missing the inperson component of her course PERIOD Basically everybody said the professor is well within his rights to make these calls PERIOD And really it seemed like no help she explained PERIOD I just felt like I have to be right enough to have this decision overturned. instead DiPietro changed her enrollment status in the class from graded to passfail PERIOD She hopes that even having missed one inperson lab she receives enough credit hours to pass the course and continue her degree program PERIOD

Its several thousand dollars that I forfeit if I withdraw from this class at this time DiPietro said PERIOD Its one thing if the campus is offering a refund PERIOD I mean they just were giving us absolutely no time to make the consideration PERIOD I just thought  its really tough. tagged remote learning Five Colleges off campus remote Hybrid Classes
