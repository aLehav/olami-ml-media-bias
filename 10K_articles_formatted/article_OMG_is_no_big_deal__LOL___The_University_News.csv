3638,2018-10-10,"a recent issue published in The University News addressed the recent addition of various internetacronyms to the Oxford English Dictionary PERIOD I quote We need to see a difference between what real words are and what are simply phrases and contractions that deserve to remain in the informal world of text messages and Facebook  not in the official documentation of our language. balderdash for so many reasons language evolves dictionaries are records of language not arbitrators of proper usage only a ninny would worry about this kind of thing etc PERIOD

I see where the ninnies are coming from PERIOD I used to be one of them worrying about misplaced apostrophes or the usage of less or fewer in supermarkets PERIOD But then something changed  I won a regional vocabulary competition PERIOD My sophomore year of high school I stood on stage and correctly identified the usage of a number of words which won me an amount of money a crystal clear trophy and a horrible misquotation in the Riverfront Times PERIOD I would go on to the final round of the competition in New York where I met my defeat at the hands of a I swear defective buzzer PERIOD

The thing is at this New York meet I came across for the first time a group of people who loved language PERIOD Some loved to memorize words definitions parts of speech the little curly things that denote pronunciation some like myself loved to read and write with these glorious little units of language some would combine both talents and go on to become linguistics majors PERIOD What brought us all together  unless I am very much mistaken  wasis a love of language PERIOD A clever turn of phrase artistic punctuation terrible puns  we loved it all PERIOD

Probably a third or so of that past paragraph was as near to lies or misrememberings as makes no difference but I left New York thinking that language could be art PERIOD I have since had that belief confirmed look no further than a P.G PERIOD Wodehouse novel or any random page of Kafka on the Shore to see words doing beautiful things PERIOD
Words form into shapes into sentences provide metaphor and imagery take us to places we could not dream of before but now fill our subconscious if we have such a thing PERIOD Words are the ultimate form of expression of art of love of hate of passion even of shear bloody nonsense PERIOD

With that in mind I would like to defend the addition of terms such as OMG to the OED PERIOD I think it is an act of arrogance to denote one word as unusable while some  metonymical discontinuity  are shown as beacons of linguistic respectability PERIOD I challenge anyone to end a first date with so you are both pulchritudinous as well as ingenious let us now engage in osculation. not that so you are beautiful and smart lets make out is any better but there is a certain something that means we would pick one over the other PERIOD

We would rather use the language as we speak it rather than the language as some people would prefer we write with PERIOD I understand of course the value of certain formalities in an academic setting but I can dismiss as irrelevant the possibility that some kid is going to come across OMG in the dictionary and assume it to be cleared for use in his or her next research paper PERIOD

I remember well that day in the fourth grade the day in which we discovered the word constipation in the dictionary PERIOD It was hilarious  it says bowels hah bowels  but that did not mean our next round of book reports went on at length about Arthur Dents constipated companion although we might have had a point or about how our independent variable just had to involve bowel problems PERIOD The point I guess is that language is beautiful PERIOD We can use it to do just about everything PERIOD So why limit it because something sounds informal OMG and LOL are IMHO just as useful a set of terms as elucidate or numismatist. in New York I learned that just because a word is defined does not mean that it should be used or that it should even be used in the way it is defined PERIOD Language changes language evolves and the way we understand one another will change too PERIOD

There will always be a place for the beautifully longwinded writing of days of yore and while I would like to get back the week I spent on Gravitys Rainbow there is a place too for modern linguistic experimentation PERIOD People said Van Gogh was crazy and if accepting the advance of language makes me crazy too at least I am in good company PERIOD
