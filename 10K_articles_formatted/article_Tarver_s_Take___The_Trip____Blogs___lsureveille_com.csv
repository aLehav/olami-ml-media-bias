Imagine a road trip you took with your family as a teenager PERIOD

At first the idea seems awful and repulsive however after a few hours jokes are made hilarious stories are told and perhaps even indescribable moments of joy occur PERIOD But then after the journey you must return home to all the pressures of everyday life PERIOD

The Trip under the direction of Michael Winterbottom is almost exactly what I have described except instead of a family the car is filled with two comedians PERIOD

The movie follows Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon both playing themselves on a road trip across England as Coogan reviews restaurants for The Observer PERIOD

Sitting a some of the finest restaurants in the country the two friends following very different lives rekindle their friendship with lame and silly jokes impressions and tales of their younger days PERIOD

Though certain scenes inflict raw emotion from the characters most of the film is overflowing with comedic genius PERIOD The dry and intelligent sense of humor both Coogan and Brydon share is impeccable PERIOD

It is the type of movie that should be watched alone with a glass of wine to appreciate PERIOD The dryness of the actors humor is reason enough not to make this movie a Saturday hangout featured film PERIOD

However if you take the time to listen and pay attention to the witty banter between the two comedians genuine laughter will overcome you PERIOD

The film is shot in a documentary style that adds another level of authenticity to the script as though the actors were simply having a conversation on camera PERIOD

The jokes told by Coogan and Brydon are told for themselves as if no one else was watching much like the content of the dreaded family road trip PERIOD This adds a more personal and ultimately powerful effect to this stunning comedy PERIOD
