To be the best you challenge the best Nasir Jones once said in a track called Rule. i cant argue with him PERIOD

So far this season the Beacons baseball team has faced off against the best the Little East Conference has to offer and so far UMass Bostons cream has not risen to the top PERIOD

Eight games into their  conference schedule the Beacons know where they stand in the hierarchy of the Little East definitely not down in UMass Dartmouth territory but not up near Keene State University or Rhode Island College either PERIOD

Now four conference games prior the tune being played would have sounded different PERIOD The Beacons started off their Little East schedule with a twogame powersweeping of Western Connecticut State and followed it up with a tidy set of onerun games against Eastern Connecticut State winning one and losing one PERIOD

Lets stop and draw the line here PERIOD

The Beacons top arms  Nick Conway Mike Andriano Tom Michael and Mike Cain  were collectively lightsout against the Constitution States duo PERIOD In  innings pitched the teams earned run average was a closetodentalflossthin . and their WHIP walks hits  innings pitched was just as impressive at . pERIOD

What helped the Beacons early on was that their pitching clicked their offense scored runs  in four games and they played a Western Connecticut team that is currently  in Little East play  overall and an Eastern Connecticut team that is having a subpar season according to their standards because of injuries and other factors PERIOD

The last four conference games for the Beacons have been a totally different story than the first four PERIOD A night and day change a Dr PERIOD Jekyll and Mr PERIOD Hyde if you will PERIOD

Rhode Island College and Keene State University two of the top three schools in the Little East have shown UMass Boston who reigns supreme PERIOD

Other than Mike Andrianos bulldog performance in game two of the Rhode Island double header a  loss the Beacons lost the three other games by six seven and eleven runs respectively PERIOD

There are a few determining factors here PERIOD

First off Keene State and Rhode Island are two teams with great offenses PERIOD These teams took the . eRA and . wHIP of UMass Bostons inconference pitching staff and gave them a talkin to PERIOD

In those four games UMBs team ERA ballooned to . and their WHIP . more than doubled PERIOD The other problem the Beacons faced in the fourgame stretch is an issue that has been hounding them most of the season both in and out of conference play PERIOD

After scoring  runs against the Connecticut teams the Beacons put  runs across against Keene State and Rhode Island combined with six of those coming in the mopup stages of game two against Keene PERIOD

The offensive production has been an issue for the Beacons this season PERIOD The team is batting . seventh in the LEC and as of April  no UMass Boston players were topfive in any of the major hitting categories PERIOD

For me thats the other determining factor PERIOD

What the Anchormen of Rhode Island and the Owls of Keene State have that UMass Boston doesnt is a lineup that can wear you down that can beat you up PERIOD

A quick peek at the top hitters on each team illustrates the picture clearly PERIOD

Keene State the best offensive team in the LEC has Tyler DiPrato . jeff Perkins . and Bobby Dovan . onetwothree atop the conference in hitting PERIOD

All three have at least  RBIs and over  hits this season PERIOD

Rhode Island College has two hitters Chris OConners and Peter Olsen batting over . with Beaconkiller Josh Cardoso not too far behind PERIOD The Anchormen have three hitters with  or more RBIs and another three with  PERIOD

Hitting PERIOD Its called a balanced attack PERIOD

The Beacons top three hitters dont match up well with the Anchormens or the Owls PERIOD

Eric Salvadores . batting average  hits and  RBIs lead the Beacons PERIOD Second third and fourth are Tim Fontaine . tom Michael . and Ryan Walsh . pERIOD The bad news is that those numbers arent going to cut it in the offensiveminded Little East no matter how good your pitching is dealing PERIOD

The good news

Salvador and Michael are juniors while Fontaine and Walsh are only freshmen PERIOD This means that these still young Beacons can get their feet wet in the LEC Tournament this season improve in the offseason and come back an even better group of hitters PERIOD

Eric Salvadors power ceiling hasnt been reached yet Tom Michaels senior year should be his best offensive season as a Beacon Tim Fontaines swing  which is already beautiful  can only get better with experience and Ryan Walshs power and batting average should only go up with a season of college baseball under his belt PERIOD

And the wild card in all of this is Danny Areanas PERIOD The junior is hitting only . this season but he leads the Beacons in homeruns with four PERIOD If Arenas can cut down on the strikeouts  in  at bats his senior season could be a monstrous one PERIOD

Right now the Beacons are getting roughed up by the elite teams of the Little East PERIOD

Its quite possible that next season could be payback time PERIOD
