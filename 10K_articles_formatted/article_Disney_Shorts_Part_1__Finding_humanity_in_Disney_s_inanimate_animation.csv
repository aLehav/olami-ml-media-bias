The amount of creativity that goes into telling a meaningful story with little to no dialogue in less than ten minutes is what fascinates me most about Disneys animated shorts PERIOD After just two minutes of watching one theres always some sort of character or creature that Ive already fallen in love with PERIOD Whether its a smiling umbrella a dancing silhouette or a grumpy cloud there is something so innately human about the way each character acts thinks and moves that keeps me coming back for more PERIOD

After letting hours pass by trapped in the Shorts section of Disney I decided to write about a few of my favorites that I feel are deserving of appreciation for either their creativity deeper meaning use of animation or a combination of these factors PERIOD Im a sucker for cute and smiley inanimate objects so narrowing it down to a selection was a tough task PERIOD But if youre looking for a quick reminder of how magical storytelling can be these shorts will do just the trick PERIOD

LOU

In a schoolyard full of elementaryaged children there sits a chest full of lost items PERIOD From clothes to baseballs to lunch boxes the lostandfound chest is a cluttered mess PERIOD When recess ends and the kids disappear into the building the items in the chest become magnetic transforming into a singular figure with baseballs as eyes mitts as hands and a red sweatshirt for a body PERIOD The lostandfound monster collects all that was left behind and then slithers back into its chest for safety PERIOD

LOU doesnt just creatively personify these lost items in the form of one cohesive figure PERIOD The short continuously transforms the monster with each obstacle it faces PERIOD If the figure jumps the items lose their magnetism while in the air PERIOD But every time the items fall back toward the ground they connect forming another version of the lostandfound monster PERIOD The endless combinations of configurations are mesmerizing PERIOD When you only have six minutes to create meaning youre going to need to use all the tricks in the book PERIOD LOU uses animation the way it should be used  to maximize storytelling creativity PERIOD

Day  Night

When Day meets Night the two become curious about what goes on while the other is out of sight PERIOD Both characters are transparent outlines of dwarfshaped bodies PERIOD As Day walks we see what he encompasses the sunrise pool parties and active joggers PERIOD When Night awakes we see the nightlife of Las Vegas the constellations and the crescent moon PERIOD The rest of the screen is black forcing us to rely on the movement of Day and Nights transparent figures for sources of color and meaning within the film PERIOD

What makes Day  Night so captivating is the way the two silhouettes overlap PERIOD When sunrise and sunset align the two figures become one pinkishorangish blurb of life PERIOD They stand next to each other and we can see one half of the sun through each of their bodies PERIOD They hug until Days sun must rise and Nights moon must set once again changing their colors and distinguishing them from each other PERIOD

Day and Night are like two friends who seemingly have nothing in common but when they take a walk in each others shoes or bodies in this case they see each other with a new level of clarity PERIOD If two outwardly different people could find even just one similarity to bring them together they may discover that they arent so different after all PERIOD Thats the message Day  Night portrays and it does so using everyday concepts everyone can relate to PERIOD Theres something inspiring about direct opposites like Day and Night learning to love each others differences PERIOD

Wind

Trapped in what seems like a deep underground chasm a grandmother and her grandson work on creating a rocket ship that might one day take them out of the abyss PERIOD The area theyre trapped in is dark and full of debris and the two use whatever scraps and resources they can find to build the contraption PERIOD The grandson drives the rocket hitting obstacles on the way out but he ultimately lands in a much brighter place PERIOD The grandmother stays in the chasm leaving the grandson to live his new life on his own PERIOD

This journey is reminiscent of the immigration process PERIOD The two characters start by using whatever resources theyre able to find to escape their past lives PERIOD But by the time they build the rocket only the grandson is able to make it out PERIOD Wind brings light to generations of struggle and the fact that an eightminute animated short without dialogue can kickstart an emotional conversation about immigration is impressive and moving PERIOD Wind offers a symbolic and compact telling of an ageold struggle that deserves to be recognized PERIOD
