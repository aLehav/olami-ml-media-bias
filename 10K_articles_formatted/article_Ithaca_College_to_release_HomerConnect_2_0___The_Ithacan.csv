Steve Desmond an enterprise applications developer at the college said the update should be live April  but could be available as soon as April  PERIOD Desmond said it is important for students to become familiar with the update before they begin registering for classes April  PERIOD

Desmond worked with Rosane Mordt a fellow enterprise applications developer and Christine Davie enterprise resource planning application architect on the redesign PERIOD Desmond said Mordt and Davie worked on HomerConnect . for a couple weeks over the past few months PERIOD Desmond said he began work on the redesign of HomerConnect April  PERIOD

The team that worked on the update met with about a dozen faculty staff and students including freshman Aaron Zufall who created the Google Chrome extension Less Terrible HomerConnect April  to receive feedback on the update PERIOD

In November members of Information Technology Services met with Zufall to talk about HomerConnect PERIOD Desmond said meeting with Zufall and seeing his creation motivated ITS to create HomerConnect . pERIOD

Honestly that was probably a big driver for why this happened Desmond said PERIOD Weve always known that its an issue PERIOD I think it was really that that said All right guys this is a really big issue you need to do this now. homerConnect . will not include a change in functionality but a change in design and organization PERIOD

The new site will not include any new functions but will bring different parts of the website to the main menu and allow students to use the back button on their browser PERIOD

Things like course registration and Res Life housing selection are going to be front and center because thats what people want to get to fastest Desmond said PERIOD

HomerConnect . will also be mobilefriendly with the website adapting to different screen sizes such as those on tablets and smartphones PERIOD

Desmond said ITS is unable to make major changes to the functionality of HomerConnect because its software is designed by Ellucian a developer of highereducation technology PERIOD

Because were using a different companys product we dont have control over certain things Desmond said PERIOD We can make it look better from the front but theres certain things we cant change. the new design includes the use of Bootstrap a free and opensource Web framework which was originally designed by the Twitter developers who made it in an opensource developer tool in August  PERIOD It is now used by  websites or . percent of the entire Internet according to builtwith.com PERIOD

It gives people a familiar interface as people are used to seeing Bootstraplike sites Desmond said PERIOD

Desmond said ITS will likely be able to make other changes to the website in the future because of this first update PERIOD

Now we can make more lightweight changes though I doubt we would do it more than once a semester as not to confuse people he said PERIOD
