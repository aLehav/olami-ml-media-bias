I heard a lot of people complaining about the recent city ordinance that prevents more than three unrelated people from living together in Stillwater PERIOD Many students had their hearts set on sharing a big house with several of their friends PERIOD It would have saved them money and it would have been a good way to spend the college years PERIOD



But the city of Stillwater stole that dream from them  or did they



I am not a fan of the city of Stillwater PERIOD I find their treatment of students exploitative of our vulnerable financial situations PERIOD However I strongly believe any laws passed by the city of Stillwater would be different if we as students would vote in Stillwater city elections PERIOD



By not voting we give the city permission to pass ordinances that hurt and inconvenience us PERIOD



There is a common misconception among students that they cannot vote in Stillwater unless they are from Stillwater PERIOD That is completely false PERIOD If you are an Oklahoma resident then you can vote in Stillwater elections if you have your voter registration moved here PERIOD It will not affect you in any way other than allowing you to be able to vote in elections that affect you where you now live PERIOD



I am so tired of hearing people say that they vote absentee ballot back home PERIOD Some people even claim they drive to vote in their hometown PERIOD Ive got news for you You are home PERIOD



For four five or even six or more years Stillwater is your home PERIOD You spend most of your time here and pay taxes here therefore you have the right and the obligation to vote here PERIOD It doesnt matter if your dads friend Billy Bob is running for city council back home and needs your vote PERIOD You need your vote so vote here PERIOD



All things in life are in some way political PERIOD If you want someone to do something for you than you have to have something they want PERIOD The local leaders want people to vote for them PERIOD Therefore they will cater to those people who have something they want in this case the ability to vote for them in local elections PERIOD They know that students dont vote so they do not have to be concerned with our needs PERIOD They pass ordinances that oppress us to make the neighborhoods quiet for the old people who go to bed at  p.m PERIOD on the weekends PERIOD



We can change this PERIOD There are at least  students at OSU who are eligible to vote in Stillwater PERIOD This is about the same amount of nonstudent residents who are eligible to vote PERIOD Assuming that only  percent of Stillwaters residents vote that means about  people out of a town of about  control the policies that affect us all PERIOD



If the same amount of students would come together and register to vote in Stillwater then we could make the city accountable to us PERIOD Only  percent of eligible students would have to register to vote PERIOD



But you ask How can I register to vote in Stillwater The process is very simple PERIOD All you have to do is take two minutes of your life to fill out a voter registration card PERIOD



Thanks to Tom Keys Director of the Student Union those voter registration forms are now available at many locations in the Student Union PERIOD All you have to do is pick one up fill it out and then stamp and mail it PERIOD If you cant afford the stamp let me know and Ill give you one PERIOD



Students we have to vote in Stillwater PERIOD This town is invariably linked with our university PERIOD We must take the time and small amount of initiative to voice our needs to it PERIOD The only way we can do this is by voting here PERIOD



If students begin to vote in Stillwater than we can essentially veto ridiculous ordinances that are unfair and unconstitutional PERIOD We can live with whoever we want party when we want and not have to worry about getting tickets every time we wake granny and grandpa up at  p.m PERIOD on Friday night PERIOD



We can have a voice and determine the direction the city will take while we are here and after we graduate PERIOD We could even have a candidate for the city commission make a campaign speech on campus PERIOD



I cannot stress how easy it is to register to vote and actually make it to the polls on the few election days each year PERIOD



You know the facts now so register to vote and do something about it PERIOD
