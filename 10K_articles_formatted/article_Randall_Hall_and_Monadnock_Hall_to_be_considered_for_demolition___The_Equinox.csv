8385,2023-10-25,"two former residence halls will be considered for demolition PERIOD

Treadwell explained that in place of Monadnock and Randall the space will possibly frst serve as green space and then possibly transition into a space where KSC can connect with the community PERIOD

According to President Melinda Treadwell We talked about the fact that Randall specifcally needs a lot of renovation to make it attractive for housing PERIOD Its just so expensive to renovate that building to serve that purpose. monadnock Hall has had a complicated history with KSC with the dorm serving as isolation housing for students who test positive for COVID19 PERIOD

In regards to Randall Hall Treadwell said that in order for Randall Hall to come down it will still require signifcant investment PERIOD

Just to do anything to Randall its  million even get started on it PERIOD Its just too expensive PERIOD Its so out of date from current code whereas Monadnock is a little bit newer and a little bit easier to scale to renovate. treadwell said Randall has asbestos materials PERIOD Yeah all of our buildings go through the same process almost every building on campus thats older than  would have some asbestos in the building materials PERIOD So we its a part of our standard process to abate that and then to take down the rest of the materials Treadwell said PERIOD

Treadwell continued So its not new PERIOD Its kind of a standard approach PERIOD We do it carefully PERIOD We do it within the laws and then we reclaim what we can dispose of the hazardous materials a totally appropriate and totally consistent nothing new just expensive to renovate in space because of it. treadwell said that she thinks both Monadnock and Randall will be coming down in the future PERIOD

Frankly I think both are going to come down PERIOD Because were looking at shifting resources into the core of the campus Treadwell said PERIOD
