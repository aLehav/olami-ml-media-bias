Following an impressive  finish through nonconference play No PERIOD  West Virginia will open Big  play this weekend against Baylor on Friday evening PERIOD

The Bears  already started conference play last week tying Texas and beating Oklahoma State in overtime PERIOD The matchup will be interesting for the Mountaineers as the Bears are the only team in the conference that West Virginia did not face last season PERIOD The meeting between the two teams was intended to conclude the regular season but storms and tornado warnings in Waco TX led to the games cancellation PERIOD

While preparation will likely be more difficult without having seen this team last season there shouldnt be much concern for the fourtime reigning conference champions PERIOD The Mountaineers are  in conference play since joining in  PERIOD The two teams have met three times with West Virginia winning two and the teams tying in their first meeting in  PERIOD Baylor has traditionally finished among the top of the conference finishing in second place behind West Virginia in both  and  PERIOD

One of the biggest concerns in facing Baylor is the unpredictability of its offense PERIOD The team scored seven goals on Jackson State earlier this month and five goals against a Purdue team that held West Virginia to two PERIOD But the team also struggled against several weaker teams being shutout three times this season including an embarrassing  loss to Samford PERIOD

Baylors most predominant threat comes in the form of sophomore forward Lauren Piercy PERIOD Piercy leads the Big  in scoring with six goals through  games PERIOD More notably five of her six goals were to win the game making her an important point of focus for the Mountaineer defense if the game is close towards the end PERIOD

West Virginia will be looking to correct troubles that plagued it throughout nonconference games PERIOD This will include putting a larger percentage of shots on net which will result in more scoring PERIOD Despite leading the country in shots per game . the Mountaineers only put . of those on net which ranks eighth in the nation PERIOD Only  percent of West Virginias are on net while their opponents have placed  on net PERIOD

Baylors defense has been impressive to make up for an inconsistent offense PERIOD The team has allowed just six goals ranking seventeenth in the nation PERIOD West Virginia known for the brick wall defense of Kadeisha Buchanan is ranked twenty-second also allowing just six goals but through two less games PERIOD The game could easily prove to be a defensive struggle as many of WVUs games this year have been PERIOD

The Mountaineers host Baylor Friday at  p.m PERIOD Dick Dlesk Stadium PERIOD The game will be West Virginias first since a double overtime loss to Georgetown which ended a twoyear unbeaten streak at home PERIOD
