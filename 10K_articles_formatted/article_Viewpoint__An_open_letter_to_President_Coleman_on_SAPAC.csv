Dear President Coleman

Years ago women on this campus fought in order to establish the
Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center PERIOD Women fought for
this center in order to create a safe space for students to grapple
with sexualized violence on our campus PERIOD This process includes
services for students who are survivors of sexual assault
harassment and related crimes PERIOD As student leaders on this campus we
were disturbed to learn that today the administration plans to
transfer these services away from SAPAC PERIOD While we were glad to see
that you are also planning an increase in resources for education
and prevention programming increases in awareness of sexual
assault and related crimes does not eliminate the need for an
oncampus program to counsel and advocate for the survivors of
these crimes and their families PERIOD

As a champion of women and the president of this university we
call upon you to stop the elimination of SAPACs counseling
services and oncampus Crisis Line PERIOD The Division of Student Affairs
plans to transfer the counseling services to Counseling and
Psychological Services and to move the Crisisline services to the
offcampus SAFE House are irresponsible and dangerous PERIOD These vital
resources must stay on campus within the jurisdiction of SAPAC PERIOD

Sexual assault domestic violence sexual harassment and
stalking occur with alarming regularity on campus PERIOD In  alone
there were  reported cases of datingdomestic violence  cases
of stalking and  reported sexual assaults on campus property
including  rapes there were  reported sexual assaults on
noncampus property or that were reported to nonpolice or police
other than the Department of Public Safety PERIOD These statistics
reflect only what was actually reported PERIOD

The Crisisline is an invaluable resource to University
students staff and faculty PERIOD Crisisline staff provide telephone
counseling to discuss these traumatic experiences and will
accompany individuals to community hospitals and other locations to
provide support and assistance PERIOD Crisisline volunteers provide
access to legal medical and academic advocacy specific to the
needs of students staff and faculty who are survivors of sexual
assault and related crimes PERIOD

A line run for students by their peers makes this vital service
more accessible to students who might otherwise feel intimidated or
alienated by talking about these deeply difficult experiences with
people outside of our campus community PERIOD Additionally removal of
the Crisisline will make it impossible to compile campusspecific
statistics on sexual assault crimes creating a false sense of
security and hampering institutional initiative to make our
community a safer place for women PERIOD By supporting an oncampus
Crisisline you demonstrate your commitment to building a
community that does not tolerate violence against women PERIOD

We know the current budget crisis affects the allocation of
University resources and that you President Coleman are committed
to ensuring University students the best education possible PERIOD
However a necessary part of a quality educational experience
depends upon a community space that is safe and comfortable for all
students PERIOD Everyday we talk with students and work to address the
needs of multiple communities across campus PERIOD We know the threat to
SAPAC is not an isolated incident it demonstrates a disturbing
trend in the administrations attitude towards student
affairs PERIOD

In the last few years the Division of Student Affairs under
the leadership of E PERIOD Royster Harper has seen its funding cut by
 as reported in the Daily PERIOD This year Student Activities
and Leadership faced a  percent budget cut resulting in a
reduction of the number of student leadership retreats they are
able to sponsor PERIOD The Offices of Lesbian Gay Bisexual and
Transgender Affairs and MultiEthnic Student Affairs have also
dealt with a serious reduction of funds PERIOD Additionally the Division
of Student Affairs has attempted to reorganize Greek life PERIOD All of
these changes have been made without student input PERIOD Cutting and
reorganizing student services are alarming on their own however
consistently reorganizing student services without any student
voice in the process is completely unacceptable PERIOD

The resources and support provided by programs in the Division
of Student Affairs need to remain accessible to students and
informed by the needs of the students not mandated by the budget
and arbitrarily altered without dialogue involving all of the
campus community PERIOD President Coleman we call for an end to the
rollback of student services PERIOD Keep the SAPAC Crisisline on campus
and counseling services available through SAPAC PERIOD Take steps to
rectify the damages that inhibit the best student services our
campus can offer PERIOD We believe that we can begin a fruitful process
of working together to create an effective institutional space for
student voices within the Division of Student Affairs PERIOD As the
executives of the elected central student assembly we urged you to
contact us in order to begin this process PERIOD

Galardi is the president of the Michigan Student Assembly

assemblys student general counsel and WellsReid is the
assemblys treasurer PERIOD
