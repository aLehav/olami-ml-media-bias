The easiest way to assure that your Halloween party isnt lame is to ban Monster Mash from the playlist PERIOD Indeed it might be best to avoid all traditional Halloween music otherwise you might as well start bobbing for apples and telling spooky stories PERIOD Congratulations  youve successfully replicated a fourth grade class party PERIOD

Just like theres a difference between sparkly Twilight vampires and actual vampires there is quite a variance in the definition of scary PERIOD Like movies a lot of music attempts to be scary but ends up laughably flat PERIOD Here are some tracks that actually will scare you PERIOD

 PERIOD Crystal Castles  Celestica

Quite frankly theres little need to play any other artist on Halloween PERIOD Producer Ethan Kass and vocalist Alice Glass whose name already sounds like its from a horror flick create adrenaline pumping freakedout electronic music PERIOD If I ever found myself running from zombies I could only hope Celestica from II would miraculously be my soundtrack PERIOD

 PERIOD Aphex Twin  Come to Daddy

If a movie were to begin with the whispered words I want your soul I would immediately turn it off and go back to watching Parks and Recreation. aphex Twin wants your soul the warped and bursting beats and his screetching is evidence enough that he is pretty serious about it PERIOD

 PERIOD Oneohtrix Point Never  Power of Persuasion

Replica is generally considered one of Daniel Lopatins most accessible works but his compositions created with retro samples and acoustic instraments are incredibly disorienting PERIOD The strange arpeggios on Power of Persuasion are almost reminscient of the soundtrack in the haunted levels in Super Mario  if it were chopped and maimed into a psychological thriller PERIOD

 PERIOD Death Grips  No Love

MC Ride has lived through some very real things in his life PERIOD No Love begins with a shout that sounds like it is coming from the bottom of a well before a stark and marching beat kicks in PERIOD Death Grips also broke up suddently this year  proof they have no love for you PERIOD

 PERIOD Radiohead  Everything in its Right Place

The synthetic and cold piano melody Thom Yorkes pleading voice and the general feeling that everything actually isnt in its right place make this a disturbing Kid A cut PERIOD

. nine Inch Nails  Reptile

Trent Reznor and his entire discography as Nine Inch Nails is slightly disturbing PERIOD But here Reznor is clearly a little miffed at some coldblooded women PERIOD Its lyrics could easily be an outline for a heartwrenching slasher flick PERIOD
