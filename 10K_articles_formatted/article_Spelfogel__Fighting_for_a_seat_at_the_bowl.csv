5299,2016-10-31,"stanford looked rejuvenated in its  win at Arizona PERIOD The biggest storyline of the game was David Shaws decision to start Keller Chryst at quarterback instead of the struggling Ryan Burns PERIOD While the call definitely paid off with a win Chryst did not look very convincing for several stretches of the game missing a few downfield passes PERIOD His final stat line was 14for30 with  yards two touchdowns and one interception PERIOD In terms of pure stats Chryst performed no better than Burns did the last few weeks PERIOD

But the differencemaker in this game was the resurgence of Christian McCaffrey PERIOD

The Stanford running back looked completely healthy and was impressive in all aspects of the game PERIOD He totaled  carries for  yards and two touchdowns  one of which cameon the receiving side  and was explosive in punt returning PERIOD Not only was McCaffrey healthier but he also got very good blocking for the first time in weeks PERIOD Whether this was because of an improved offensive line or just a weak Arizona team is to be determined PERIOD But regardless of the opponent Stanford looked much improved in all aspects of the game especially special teams both in punting and field goal attempts PERIOD

This game could serve as a harbinger of things to come PERIOD Stanford has a decidedly easier remaining schedule and should continue to add victories to the W column with a visit from a  Oregon State team followed by a trip to the depleted Ducks PERIOD With two formidable running backs now healthy better offensive blocking and a shutdown defense Stanford should perform at the level that was expected of it at the beginning of the season PERIOD

The Cardinal still havea shot at some very good bowl games but with three losses they will likely not be in contention for New Years Day bowl games even if they run the table PERIOD If Stanford finishes the season decently with four losses it might get drawn to the Las Vegas Bowl which is one of the first bowl games of the year PERIOD The Foster Farms Bowl would probably pass on Stanford given the weak turnout two years ago despite the fact that the game was played just  miles from campus PERIOD Sin City would be a more likely destination asthe game will be played the day after fall quarter finals end and Stanford could in theory seea significant numberof students journey to the desert before winter break begins in earnest PERIOD

But Stanford can still shoot for more prestigious Bowls PERIOD First of all it is not unprecedented for a threeloss team to make it to a New Years Six bowl but Stanford would need a lot of help in that department PERIOD Short of a miracle Stanford would probably end up in the Cactus or Holiday bowl depending on its final ranking among Pac12 competitors PERIOD

The CFP committee releases its first rankings this week so it will be interesting to see where Pac12 teams rank in comparison with other title contenders PERIOD Washington will surely be ranked in the top four but it will be more noteworthy to see where Washington State Colorado Utah and USC rank PERIOD If these teams have strong rankings that will improve Stanfords strength of schedule and the Cardinal could reappear in the top  after a couple more wins PERIOD

Stanford has shown talent and resiliency this season despite its poor performance in many games specifically on the offensive side PERIOD

The loss that hurt the most wasnot ablowout to either of the Washington teams but Stanfords slumping to defeat against the Buffaloes PERIOD Close games like that are what define seasons PERIOD Stanford cannot afford any more blunders at this point PERIOD The next two weeks will bring clarity to the Pac12 race PERIOD Stanford fans should root for Washington to keep winning  and Wazzu and Colorado losses would definitely not hurt along the way PERIOD

It will be interesting to see which quarterback Shaw starts next week given the lukewarm performance of Chryst but fortuitous outcome of the game PERIOD If Stanford truly has returned to the form of last season this Saturday against Oregon State should produce more epic numbers for Christian McCaffrey and maybe even fan excitement again PERIOD
