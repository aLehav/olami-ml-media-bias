A few passing clouds otherwise generally clear PERIOD Low 43F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



In April of  the Tennessee Valley Authority TVA announced they are planning to retire the last two coal plants in Tennessee by  PERIOD

While this news was initially a huge success for environmental activists the TVA later annouced it plans to replace the two coal plants with a  miles of gas pipelines in East and Middle Tennessee PERIOD

Natural gas is a risky source of energy an unrenewable source thats expensive and risky for nearby communities and wildlife PERIOD

Gas pipelines can impact habitats and wildlife due to increased greenhouse gas emissions habitat distruction stream pollution and introduce invasive species to an ecosystem PERIOD

The TVAs proposed pipeline is also set to cross  streams and wetlands putting all of these precious resources at risk PERIOD In addition hundreds of acres of forest will be destroyed PERIOD

While the TVA completed an environmental impact report they failed to acknowledge that their proposed pipeline would cause a harmful impact on hundred of acres of bat habitat PERIOD Across this  miles includes the Northern longeared bat which was recently listed as an endangered species and the Tricolored bat which faces the same fate PERIOD

The Endangered Species Act requires the protection of critical habitat areas and the development and implementation of recovery plans for listed species PERIOD

Despite these concerning facts the CEO of the TVA Jeff Lyash still intends to move forward with the natural gas plant PERIOD

Lyash a man with long ties to the fossil fuel industry has an annual salary of . million dollars a year PERIOD

Before working for the TVA Lyash served as the executive vice president of energy supply for Duke Energy PERIOD

During his tenure at the company Duke Energy leaked toxic chemicals into the groundwater which supplied the sole source of water for nearly one million residents in North Carolina PERIOD Additionally Duke Energy dumped millions of gallons of toxic coal into the Dan River PERIOD

Duke Energy later plead guilty to nine criminal violations of the Clean Water Act paying out  million in fines and restitution PERIOD

While the TVA claims that their team is committed to improving the quality of life for the ten million people they serve Lyash has failed to do so in his past and is continuing to do so now with the proposed TVA pipeline PERIOD
