Forrest Kline of Hellogoodbye energizes the crowd at Rock the Quad on Sunday at Elliott Hall of Music PERIOD

Waves of nostalgia came across the students on Sunday at Elliott Hall as they joined Hellogoodbye frontman Forrest Kline in singing the bands famous song from years ago Here in Your Arms. students enjoyed the performance as Hellogoodbye performed in the annual Rock the Quad event hosted by Cary Club and WCCR Cary Clubs radio station PERIOD

Normally Rock the Quad is held on Slayter Hill however because of a forecast of rain the event was moved indoors to a much larger space PERIOD Overall there was a general air of positive energy with students singing and dancing to The Clutter House of Heroes and Hellogoodbye PERIOD

The night began with local band The Clutter taking over the stage as they performed some of their original songs PERIOD The Clutter showcased their original indierock feel PERIOD House of Heroes kept the crowd excited with guitar solos and classic harmonizing vocals PERIOD

Audrey Walts a sophomore in the College of Health and Human Sciences enjoyed the show despite the change of venue PERIOD

I really loved the performers they all had really high energy PERIOD It was fun to dance to. although many students enjoyed the event some were disappointed at the lastminute change in venue PERIOD

It was a little underwhelming PERIOD Its normally outside but it was inside and theres not that many people here. said Paul Hockerman a sophomore in the College of Science PERIOD

Hellogoodbye played many new songs from their new album Everything is Debatable which didnt have quite the same feel as the old ones PERIOD

Griffin Tyner a junior in the College of Technology said his favorite song was the last one they played Here in Your Arms. it was not what I expected PERIOD I didnt know they had a new album out so they didnt play many songs that I knew but I still really enjoyed it. log In
