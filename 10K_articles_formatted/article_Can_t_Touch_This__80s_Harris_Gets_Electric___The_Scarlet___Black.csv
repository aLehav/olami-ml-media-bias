The Harris Concert Hall traveled back in time to the tunes of Human League and other great 80s artists last Saturday Sept PERIOD  PERIOD A yearly ritual and one of the most anticipated Harris dance parties 80s Harris is always like gnarly dude PERIOD With at least  students in attendance this years 80s proved to be one of the most entertaining and spectacular weekends of the fall semester to date PERIOD

Carly Wakshlag  was an unofficial organizer for the event PERIOD Wakshlag said that the first Harris she attended was the 80s during her first year and since then she has loved the event leading her to plan this years party PERIOD

My friend and I were at a concert in Iowa City and I was checking my email that said that 80s Harris needed a host and we were like We should host 80s I thought it was completely unacceptable that nobody had volunteered to host the 80s so I became proactive in making sure it happened Wakshlag said PERIOD

Although Wakshlag was not Training for Intervention Procedures TIPS certified she partnered with friends who wanted to help out and who were TIPS certified PERIOD Eventually two kegs of beer were served to students with 21plus wristbands PERIOD Pizza was the only food that was served but as Wakshlag pointed out it ran out quickly PERIOD

Wakshlag was surprised by the amount of money that was raised PERIOD

We collected over  dollars which is insane she said PERIOD North campus definitely donated the most. wakshlag also attributed the success of the event to the music and the fashion that prevailed throughout the 1980s PERIOD However aside from her claim that the 80s is simply the best decade all around the dance also happened early in the year so students were especially excited and fully embodied the 80s vibe PERIOD

Wakshlag also thanked the other contributors of the event PERIOD Along with Wakshlag Ellen Pinnette  Michael Riegsecker  Mia Ritter  Quinnita Bellows  Fabiola Barral  Austin Morris  and Becca Heller  helped make the event a fruitful experience PERIOD
