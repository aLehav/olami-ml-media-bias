After XMen  few people had any hopes for there being another XMen movie PERIOD Likewise many viewed Fox as the devil for destroying what the previous two films set up PERIOD XMen Origins Wolverine tells us who Logan was before his memory was taken from him PERIOD

The recent trend in comicbook movies is realism PERIOD The Dark Knight showed everyone how realistic the super hero world can be XMen Origins Wolverine does not PERIOD This movie is over the top from beginning to end there is seldom a moment when you stop and ponder if that could really happen PERIOD Sitting through this movie is like reading a comic book there are explosions every few seconds and tough guys jumping out of helicopters PERIOD

Fox spared no expense in putting as many mutants they could in Wolverine PERIOD Hugh Jackman returns to the roll as Wolverine  no big surprise there PERIOD The real surprise was Liev Schreiber as SabretoothVictor Creed PERIOD

Schreiber exploded with feral rage every second he was on the screen PERIOD The character of Sabretooth was always an animal and this film decided to go a different route PERIOD We see an intelligent killing machine that as vicious as he is smart PERIOD

Another actor who shined in his role was Danny Huston as William Stryker PERIOD The X2 Stryker was an old man with a vendetta for all mutants PERIOD Huston shows us a completely sane human being who slowly loses his mind and becomes the typical mad scientist bent on destruction PERIOD

Ryan Reynolds shines as the merc with the mouth Wade WilsonDeadpool PERIOD

As for the rest of the cast everyone is a spot on embodiment of all their mutant characters PERIOD

Directed by Gavin Hood famous for his award winning Tsoti XMen Origins plot moves along pretty fast but doesnt feel rushed in anyway PERIOD Besides a few moneymaker shots that we all saw in the trailers and TV spots Wolverine rising from the tank looking extremely pissed this isnt exactly a break through for Hood PERIOD

The action in XMen Origins is over the top PERIOD Mutant powers are used in full force and look great PERIOD The fights between Wolverine and Sabretooth are nothing short of epic and relentless PERIOD It may sound like I think this movie is perfect but thats not the case PERIOD

One of the biggest problems in this movie was the bad computergenerated imagery PERIOD Thats right a big budget action movie with a star studded cast and Hugh Jackman has bad CGI PERIOD

For some reason the simplest scenes had the worst effects PERIOD There is a scene where Logan is getting used to his new claws and it is obvious that the claws arent there PERIOD It astounds me that the first XMen movie that was made almost a decade ago had better computer effects then this one PERIOD

As a huge XMen fan my only concern was that this movie was better than X3 and it is PERIOD Perhaps not the best comic book movie ever made but the best movie that looks and feels like a comic book PERIOD
