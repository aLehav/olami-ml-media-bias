Cal State Fullerton womens soccer began the regular season with a win last week but couldnt keep the momentum going into the weekend PERIOD

The Titans were dealt a pair of losses by Auburn and Georgia leading to a  road trip through the SEC PERIOD

CSUF lost  to Auburn Friday in their first game of the weekend PERIOD The Tigers scored one goal in each half and pressured the Titans up and down the pitch to secure a shutout victory PERIOD It was Auburns second win of the season PERIOD

Midfielder Brooke Ramsier put the game into motion for Auburn scoring in the seventh minute after CSUF failed to clear the ball out of its 18yard line following a Courtney Schell cross from midfield PERIOD Schell scored a goal of her own in the fifty-first minute burying a onetouch volley off a pass from Kristen Dodson PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Tigers proved their national worth in their wiretowire victory keeping the ball on Fullertons half for the majority of the evening and taking twice as many shots as the Titans  attempts to CSUFs seven PERIOD

When the Titans managed to mount a counterattack Auburn was right in their jerseys forcing overly ambitious passes or quick shots into traffic PERIOD

The Titans didnt go down without a fight however PERIOD Tireless forward Nano Oronoz took two shots and continued to attack well into the second half even when it became clear Auburn was making its way to victory PERIOD Senior Jennifer Stuart may have let in two goals but the  Big West goalie of the year saved six other shots as the Tigers fired away all night PERIOD

CSUF couldnt bounce back against Georgia on Sunday with another  loss leaving them with a winless weekend PERIOD UGA dominated the Titans from the first whistle taking  more shots than the blue and orange in the first half PERIOD Georgias ninth attempt found paydirt when a curving rocket from the left side of the 18yard box from Lauren Tanner in the thirty-first minute got past the outstretched arm of Stuart PERIOD

The Titans showed more fight in the second half PERIOD CSUF came out after the break noticeably more aggressive with quicker passes and more long balls leading to more time spent on the Bulldogs half PERIOD This aggression backfired when Kelsey Killean got ahead of Fullertons defense on a rapid counter following a stop with only a foul by Savannah Sloniger preventing a oneonone against Stuart PERIOD Killean blasted in the resulting penalty kick PERIOD

For the second game in a row CSUF had opportunities in the closing minutes PERIOD Forwards Connie Caliz and Oronoz both had opportunities to score with less than five minutes to play while Jessica Simonian had her longdistance attempt saved by UGA goalie Louise Hogrell maintaining a Georgia shut out PERIOD

The Titans return home and will look to rebound from their weekend woes against Utah State on Friday at  p.m PERIOD
