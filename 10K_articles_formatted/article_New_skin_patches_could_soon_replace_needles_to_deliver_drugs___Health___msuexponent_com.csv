Scientists could signal the end of needles after developing an innovative new skin patch that painlessly delivers drugs to the body PERIOD

The  skin patch developed by scientists at the University of Bath delivers a controlled dosage of medicine directly into the body eliminating the need for injections or oral medication PERIOD

It is hoped that the patches which are described in the journal Biomaterials Advances will be ready for public use within the next five to  years PERIOD

Funded by funded by EPSRC and Abbott Diabetes Care the new patches are made from a new substance   a gellike substance in which water forms the liquid component PERIOD

They can also be 3D printed making them more affordable than existing commercially available microneedle patches PERIOD

A photo of the patch shows how it it smaller than a pound coin featuring visible microneedles which painlessly pierce the first few layers of skin when applied PERIOD

Contact with fluid beneath the skin barrier causes the  needles to swell allowing a specific dosage of the chosen drug to enter a patients body PERIOD

Bath Universitybased chemical engineer Dr Hannah Leese developed the patches alongside fellow engineers PhD student Joseph Turner Professor Pedro Estrela and biologist Dr Maisem Laabei PERIOD

She says that she can imagine one day everyday Brits wearing patches under their smart watches monitoring stress hormone changes and other data PERIOD

She said Injections are invasive and expensive and they dont suit everyone PERIOD A lot of people are needlephobic and are understandably reluctant to receive medicine by injection even when treatment is really needed PERIOD



While people are typically happier to take drugs orally Dr PERIOD Leese says that there can be negative side effects to pills or delays that the new patches could speed up PERIOD

She added You can experience gastrointestinal sideeffects there is a delay between taking the medication and the drug getting to where its needed in the body



Dr PERIOD Leese anticipates that the patches will be able to deliver both drugs that circulate the entire body and drugs that need to remain more localized PERIOD

For example the patches could be used to treat infected areas of the body PERIOD There is also scope for the patches to deliver vaccines and to monitor hormone levels PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Leese said We can also see there being a role for these patches in the health and wellness fields

I can picture the day people have microneedles under their smartwatches to detect fluctuations in the stress hormone cortisol. originally published on talker.news part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange PERIOD
