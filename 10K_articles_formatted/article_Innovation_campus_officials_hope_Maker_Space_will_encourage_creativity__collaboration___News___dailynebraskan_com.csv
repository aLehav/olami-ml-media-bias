When Innovation Campus completes construction in  it will include a Maker Space a place for students to create and innovate with 3D printers lasers and other equipment PERIOD

Nebraska Innovation Campus is hoping to foster creativity community and collaboration with a space for students to create and innovate called Maker Space said Kate Engel the community management and operations director PERIOD

Officials discussed the move at the Innovation Campus update meeting in the Nebraska Union Auditorium Thursday afternoon PERIOD NIC staff also discussed the intention to move into the campus and begin operations by May  and move the University of NebraskaLincoln food science department by  PERIOD

NIC Director Dan Duncan said leaders will have to wait for the sticker shock to wear off before they can start innovating PERIOD To complete construction of the 2millionsquarefoot research campus on schedule construction must maintain pace of  square feet per year at an estimate cost of  million per year Duncan said PERIOD

Its a very very aggressive growth strategy Duncan said PERIOD But if they can secure funding he said NIC could change the world PERIOD

Engel wants the Maker Space to be thought of just like the Campus Recreation Center PERIOD It would be studentrun with studenttaught classes where anyone could go to engage in creative activities such as carpentry and engineering PERIOD It would be an environment where anyone can build and create in a space that encourages collaboration Engel said PERIOD

Business Accelerator Director Terence Bowden said the ultimate goal of the Maker Space is to have it work directly alongside the business accelerator which will support development and entrepreneurship PERIOD That way startups can go to Business Accelerator to polish ideas and then develop the prototype right next door PERIOD

We want to be able to say Come on down use a 3D printer use a laser Engel said PERIOD

There are still safety issues that need to be addressed PERIOD Not everyone knows how to use power tools let alone a laser cutter but for the Maker Space to fulfill its potential leaders need to do whatever they can to enable creativity Duncan said PERIOD

The Maker Space has to be a place where there arent a lot of rules Duncan said PERIOD

He said officials are discussing having people take safety tests to use dangerous equipment PERIOD However the Maker Space is still only in its conceptual stage so itll be given a lot of thought Duncan said PERIOD

Its very dependent on funding and who works with us Engel said PERIOD

With UNL and private companies trying to reduce risk as much as possible finding funding for a center that allows anyone to use expensive equipment however they want might take some time she said PERIOD

Ideally Duncan said the Maker Space would be privately funded which would help entrepreneurs students and researchers put their creativity to use in an uninhibited fashion PERIOD Safety will be a top priority no matter who funds the Maker Space he said PERIOD

Were going to make a lot of people nervous including myself Duncan said but thats what you have to do to shake things up and drive innovation. newsdailynebraskan.com
