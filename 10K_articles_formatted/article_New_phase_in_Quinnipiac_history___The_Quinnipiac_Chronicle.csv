Quinnipiac University recently was given the privilege to say it is the first university in the New England area to have a chapter of the African American Journalists Organization or AAJO PERIOD

Sean Lyons advisor of AAJO came across this organization before coming to Quinnipiac PERIOD

Lyons informed journalism majors Kerry Ellington and Anastacia Tucker about the organization PERIOD

After filling out various applications to the Nation Association of Black Journalists NABJ Quinnipiac was accepted PERIOD

Having the first AAJO in New England can be used as a great marketing tool to bring students of different races to the university PERIOD

Ellington and Tucker are hoping that the organization will encourage minorities to go into journalism. they are hoping to get the schools name out by organizing different events and essentially opening up doors to new and exciting opportunities PERIOD

These opportunities include internships conventions and workshops concerning things such as resume building skills PERIOD

The NABJ is hosting a convention in Indianapolis PERIOD Ellington and Tucker hope to attend and gain insight about other school chapters meet new students and participate in the workshops held there PERIOD

Those interested in the AAJO do not need to be journalism majors PERIOD The organization is open to everyone PERIOD

For more information email Sean Lyons at his university email address PERIOD
