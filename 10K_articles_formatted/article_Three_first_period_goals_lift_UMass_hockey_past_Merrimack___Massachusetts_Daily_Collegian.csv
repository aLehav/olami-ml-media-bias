Massachusetts hockey coach John Michelettos goal for his team each game is to be the first to score three goals PERIOD Hes a believer that the team that wins the race to three often wins the game PERIOD

He didnt wait long to get his wish Friday night PERIOD

The Minutemen scored three firstperiod goals to cruise to a  win over Merrimack in front of  at Mullins Center to snap a fivegame winless streak and claim their second consecutive Hockey East win PERIOD

UMass three goals in the first were its most in a period since it scored four in the second period of its  win over Michigan State on Oct PERIOD  and was just the second time this season it has scored five or more goals in a game PERIOD

Its nice to get to three UMass coach John Micheletto said PERIOD We talk about it a lot you hear me say it an awful lot the race to three usually wins PERIOD  To close the game out like we did I was very happy with the effort. steven Iacobellis Troy Power Adam Phillips and Branden Gracel all scored for the Minutemen while Michael Pereira reached  career points with an emptynet goal and assist and Conor Sheary reached  career points with a twoassist night PERIOD Goaltender Steve Mastalerz made  saves for his seventh win of the season PERIOD

With  days between games following its  loss to American International in which it had  shots on goal and  total launches it was a good chance for a UMass team averaging . goals per game entering Friday night to take out some frustration on Hockey Easts lastplace team PERIOD

We came into this game knowing we kinda had a chance for a new season Pereira said PERIOD All the games down the stretch are in Hockey East play PERIOD All the cards are on the table right now so we gotta lay it on the line which is what we tried to do Friday. the Minutemen   Hockey East began the onslaught eight minutes  seconds into the first period when Iacobellis scored a breakin onetimer off a feed from Conor Sheary for his tenth goal of the season PERIOD

Sheary carried the puck down the left circle off a Warriors defensivezone turnover and fed the freshman with a pinpoint pass to beat Merrimack goaltender Rasmus Tirronen glove side PERIOD Iacobellis is the first UMass freshman to score at least  goals in a season since Pereira and Phillips both reached that mark in  PERIOD

The Minutemen doubled their advantage five minutes later when Pereira hit Power for a onetimer for his forty-ninth career assist PERIOD

Phillips put UMass up  with . seconds left in the first period with a goal off assists from Colin Shea and Zack LaRue off another Warriors turnover PERIOD

We dont know the feeling of winning lately Sheary said PERIOD To come into the locker room with a  lead is a huge thing for us PERIOD

We had a lot of positive energy in the room PERIOD Were not coming in there pouting saying I didnt get that goal. we put up three and we didnt give up any so it really boosted us forward going into the second. gracel scored his tenth goal of the season  into the second period to put the Minutemen up  PERIOD Gracel passed the puck to Sheary who possessed it behind the goal line and fed him right in front for another highlightreel goal on a onetimer PERIOD

Were just trying to work on getting pucks to the net and being at the right place at the right time Pereira said of the goals PERIOD Being in the slot helps you score some goals but I think thatll help us moving down the stretch looking back at this game. merrimack   HEA finally broke through at  on a powerplay goal by Chris LeBlanc to cut the deficit to  PERIOD The Warriors attempted a comeback in the third period when Justin Mansfield beat Mastalerz high blocker side at  to make it  but it was stopped short when Josh Myers received a fiveminute major and game misconduct midway through the third when Joel Hanley took a big hit by the Merrimack bench to halt any Warriors momentum PERIOD

The two teams complete their weekend series Saturday night at  p.m PERIOD at Lawler Arena PERIOD
