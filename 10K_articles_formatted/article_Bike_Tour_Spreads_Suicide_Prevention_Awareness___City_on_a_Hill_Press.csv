The bike team rode into Santa Cruz last Saturday on the third day of their 7000mile 214day bike tour PERIOD

The team called their pilgrimage Revolution Inspired by Self Evolution RISE Phoenix PERIOD It was created to spread awareness about resources available to people affected by suicide and to create a space for open dialogue on the topic of suicide PERIOD

Creativity compassion community and collaboration will always rise above competition Chipps said PERIOD By creatively expressing who you are within your community and supporting those around you we hope that will bring about healing for those who have lost someone due to suicide as well as prevent people from dying from suicide by getting rid of that isolation and forming a community. brown and Chipps began the bike tour on March  in San Francisco and plan to finish in Wappingers Falls N.Y PERIOD on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD The team will stop in  cities in  states where they will reach out to local suicide awareness agencies like the Suicide Prevention Service SPS in Santa Cruz County PERIOD The pair are also planning to make a documentary about the journey PERIOD

The two decided in August  to make the journey across the United States in honor of their brothers PERIOD Six months later Brown called Chipps and said OK lets organize this. when I made that phone call we knew we were going to do it in  Brown said PERIOD It wasnt like Lets set up everything and see where we are at. it was Were going to do it so lets get what we can. they began a partnership with La Frontera Suicide Prevention Center in Arizona and with the help of friends reached out to other suicide prevention centers and bicycle shops for donations to fund their mission PERIOD

Stops on the bike tour include Arizona where Browns brother was laid to rest and Nebraska where Chipps brother rests PERIOD

Two suicide survivors decided to travel crosscountry for suicide awareness Brown said PERIOD We both like to call it a cosmic giggle PERIOD You couldnt write a story as beautiful as that. when the team started the trip they said they had no idea how much support would be awaiting them in Santa Cruz PERIOD

People want to come in to join support groups  they are interested in becoming volunteers for our crisis line just because Zachary and Thomas came here said Bonnie Sultan the assistant director for SPS PERIOD They gave that inspiration to people. the team has been using social media outlets to spread awareness of their cause PERIOD Brown a photographer and video artist has been filming the beginning of the journey and posting video blogs following the teams experience PERIOD RISE Phoenix also creates and sells necklaces that have bike chains hanging on them to symbolize unity for the cause PERIOD The money from the chains will help finance the tour and the documentary PERIOD



Brown said he hoped people would walk away with at least one message from the bike tour PERIOD

Realize that not only are you not alone but you have beautiful potential to create whatever world you want for yourself Brown said PERIOD Above all apart from the outside criticism dont let that inner critic get in the way  because thats going to be the most daunting. sPS and RISE Phoenix have been working together to spread suicide awareness throughout as many branches of the Santa Cruz community as possible including the student population PERIOD

For students suicide is the third leading cause of death which is very frightening for us and its something that doesnt have to happen Sultan said PERIOD We provide education and provide a safe space for people to come and get help. sultan said she hopes movements like this will eliminate a stigma around talking about suicide PERIOD

We are really in awe of Brown and Chipps Sultan said PERIOD We dont want them to leave Santa Cruz. rISE Phoenix raised only  percent of their budget before the start date PERIOD Many community members have volunteered to open their homes to the team PERIOD The San Francisco Coast Guard offered shelter for the team and Sultan said perfect strangers in Santa Cruz County welcomed Brown and Chipps into their homes PERIOD
