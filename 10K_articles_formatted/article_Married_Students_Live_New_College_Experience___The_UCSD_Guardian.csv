6242,2023-10-08,"four years ago in a general chemistry class Thurgood
Marshall College senior Annalisa Perez spilled acid on Eleanor Roosevelt
College senior Will Perezs notebook PERIOD Embarrassed she offered to buy him a new
one PERIOD Little did she know one year later her acidspill victim would be her
future husband PERIOD Now in their second year of marriage the Perezes are a college
minority PERIOD

They scheduled their wedding around UCSDs quarter system
and married during spring break of their sophomore year PERIOD Despite the stressful
combination of finals and lastminute wedding planning Annalisa was satisfied
with the timing of her commitment PERIOD

I didnt want to wait to get married because life is
going to get crazier once we start med school and grad school Annalisa said PERIOD

Despite their situation the Perezes longed to commit PERIOD Just
one year after dating they both realized that they wanted to get married PERIOD

I know it sounds borderline cliche Will said but I knew
after the first real deep conversation that we had that I wanted to spend the
rest of my life with her PERIOD My friends kept on asking Are you sure Are you
sure But after I told them that shes the one they were more receptive about
it. like the Perezes Eleanor Roosevelt College junior Carmen
Grageola also married during college PERIOD

The big reason was that I felt I was ready Grageola said PERIOD
At age  all I wanted to do was go to school PERIOD At  I did see myself
marrying young. like any college student Grageola is busy however school
is not her main focus PERIOD She works approximately  hours a week at the UCSD
Bookstore in addition to taking classes PERIOD She and her husband  who works two
jobs and is in the Army Reserves  have two young children PERIOD While she works and
attends class her mother and her husband take care of her sons PERIOD

With added family responsibilities of her own Grageola
doesnt have the concerns of a typical college student PERIOD

Once you get married you dont think about what to wear
Grageola said PERIOD You have to think about what to cook for dinner PERIOD College
students have the luxury to do what they want to do without having to think
about other people and how its going to affect people living in the same
household. although her commitment to her family takes up much of her
time Grageola manages to study during her lunch breaks and at night after her
children are asleep PERIOD

When I study I have
to really focus because I know I wont have a second chance Grageola said PERIOD

Grageola also has difficulties managing her social life and
can only set aside two hours a month to catch up with her friends PERIOD The Perezes
feel similarly about their social ties PERIOD

Just like any
relationship you want to spend more time with the person so you have to put
other activities aside Will said PERIOD First it was friends then it was working
out and now its sleep. the Perezes noticed that after their marriage their
mindsets about schoolwork became more focused and they became less preoccupied
with things that would distract a typical single college student PERIOD

I realize we have different backgrounds and interests
Will said PERIOD I am trying to take notes intently on my laptop while the person
next to me is on MySpace. due to the demanding responsibilities of her family
Grageolas interests have also evolved PERIOD

Im on the side of life where I already did it and Im
ready for something else she said PERIOD Now just having coffee with friends and
having a nice conversation for hours  thats enough its fulfilling  youre
settled down and thinking on a different level. according to Housing and Dining Services Director Mark
Cunningham there are  married
undergraduates living in the Affiliated Residential Community Housing for
married graduate and undergraduate couples and in universityowned complexes
such as Mesa Apartments and La Jolla del Sol PERIOD Thirtyfive of the married
undergraduates have children PERIOD

While their college lifestyle may have been different from
the majority of their peers both Gageola and the Perezes are satisfied with
their decision PERIOD

I do get a little bit jealous Im not going to lie  but
at the same time I feel so accomplished on so many levels Grageola said PERIOD
When I come home I have two little ones that run to me and say Mommy and
that makes up for everything else. your donation will support the student journalists at University of California San Diego PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment keep printing our papers and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
