Brian Michael Bendis destroyed the Avengers PERIOD



For those of you unfamiliar with the Marvel Universe  home to bigscreen heros like SpiderMan and the XMen as well as boxoffice duds like Daredevil and the Fantastic Four  the Avengers were a team of the worlds greatest super heros who united to take on challenges no single hero could PERIOD



The key word there is 



The bigwigs at Marvel decided that it was time for the Avengers to go in a new direction so they handed the book over to superstar writer Brian Michael Bendis of  and  fame PERIOD Bendis then wrote a story arc in which everything that could go wrong for the Avengers did the team disbanded and the longrunning title ended PERIOD



It turns out though that this was just Bendis setup for one of the most popular new titles of the year 



The story begins six months after the events that brought the Avengers to their knees PERIOD When a twobit supervillain is hired to start a prison break at the Raft  the superhuman wing of Rykers Island Maximum Security prison  a group of heros all at the Raft for their own reasons assemble to stop it PERIOD



Following that night with  supervillains now on the loose Captain America leader of the fallen Avengers decides to form a group of new Avengers and asks all the heroes from the prison break to join PERIOD Though Daredevil turns down the offer and the mysterious hero The Sentry remains a  the others rise to the challenge PERIOD



The New Avengers  now consisting of Captain America founding Avenger Iron Man SpiderMan and SpiderWoman no relation power man Luke Cage and later the XMens Wolverine  assemble and take off to get to the bottom of things PERIOD



 is easily one of the best titles to come out of Marvel in quite some time PERIOD The writing is simply superb PERIOD Bendis has the uncanny ability to create books that are simultaneously actionpacked and chockfull of funny and intelligent commentary PERIOD He is able to do huge things with his stories without making them feel big for the sake of being big PERIOD



Bendis also writes the characters perfectly PERIOD And in such a diverse group as this  from sarcastic smart guy SpiderMan to the hardline military man Captain America and every personality in between  that is no easy task PERIOD



Nearly overshadowing Bendis storytelling however is David Finchs art PERIOD He draws the characters in such a way as to show the real human side to these superhuman individuals PERIOD



He is able to keep up with Bendis fastpaced style of writing while making every panel feel like the most important one in the book PERIOD Finch also seems to enjoy having large sweeping pages of one scene in which to shine as evidenced by the spectacular visuals he creates with them PERIOD



Though Bendis and Finch have drawn a lot of negative responses from diehard Avengers fans and Bendis does have a tendency to rush a story without fully exploring all the possibilities the creative duo really fits the team and the book PERIOD



If youre not a comicbook reader but have been meaning to give it a try  is highly enjoyable and will show you the best that comics can be  but you may miss some of the inside jokes between characters and subtleties about their world PERIOD
