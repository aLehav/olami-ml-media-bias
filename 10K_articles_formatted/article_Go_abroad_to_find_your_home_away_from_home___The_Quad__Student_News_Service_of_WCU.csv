Dr PERIOD Lordan is credited with my first trip to Ireland two years ago now PERIOD Along with  other students I partook in his Media in Ireland course PERIOD By the time we boarded the plane back to the United States I knew I would return to live in Ireland PERIOD And I did for eight months this past fall PERIOD Ill return again soon but this time as an Irish citizen PERIOD It all began with taking that first leap of partaking in a study abroad course PERIOD

This summer Dr PERIOD Lordan will once again return to Ireland with West Chester students PERIOD This time around the Media in Ireland course will lead students from Limerick and Galway in the west of Ireland all the way to Dublin in the east PERIOD

The trip featured will be field trips of a lifetime that a tourist alone wouldnt gain access to PERIOD Students will go to TG4s studioIrelands only television station broadcast in the Irish language PERIOD They will sit on the edge of the Cliffs of Moher sip on a Guinness at the Guinness Storehouse find their ancestry at Ancestry.coms headquarters in Dublin find out just what the words coppers and pennys mean amongst a thousand other experiences that are priceless PERIOD

Eight students are already signed up and there is plenty of room for more.pullquote aligncenterIreland is my home away from home and it couldnt have been without venturing across the Atlantic Ocean for the first time two years ago.pullquote
