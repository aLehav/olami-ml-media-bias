IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT A LITTLE GEM of an opinion has shown up on the radar of Fresno Famous PERIOD

Earlier this week the Web site posted an entry about a recent CampusSpeak asking students about KFSR PERIOD To my surprise the poster seems to believe that I onehalf of the team that tracks out into the campus abyss most Mondays at noon to plead random students to answer random questions for CampusSpeak am at fault for the ignorance of Fresno State attendees PERIOD Not only is this entirely off base but a gross accusation PERIOD

I suppose its my fault that even though we stood outside the Speech Arts building with the satellites plainly in view only two students we even talked to were aware of KFSR PERIOD

To label the articles of my column frivolous or a waste of space is one thing  because yes they are an excuse for me to not care about school for a couple of moments in my life  but to attack me for something that is completely out of the mouths of others and out of my control is misguided PERIOD

We dont go out asking these questions in hopes of uncovering outoftouch students and the one jerk on campus that makes everyone look bad PERIOD

Those who protest the loudest for how ridiculous the CampusSpeak in the Wednesday paper and the Web site video makes the population look are the ones who informed us they were late for class at  p.m PERIOD when we asked if they could spare a minute PERIOD

As a newbie on the Collegian staff Ive taken a habit of reading all the comments on the site not just for opinion but also across the sections PERIOD A small percentage of them actually praise the article and an even smaller amount actually contributes anything PERIOD

Most drum roll please are boisterously negative viciously attacking the writer article itself or vomiting hatred toward the entire Collegian PERIOD

Ive lost count the number of times any one of my fellow Opinion writers have received the same tired bitchslap question how is this worthy of print

Its not just us it is all Web sites that enable comments PERIOD You all who take the time to get worked up about something that youve read enough to type and send are an angry lot PERIOD

Sometimes you use your names and others hide behind some machismo Internet persona theyve invented where they attempt to belittle people just doing their job not all of us are paid mind you in order to maybe get a few agreements from fellow yesmen PERIOD

Well Im ready for it give me your worst

I hate Dane Cook still for his craterface the material he has stolen and the movies he has ruined PERIOD

I think pirates are cooler than ninjas PERIOD They function while drunk and sail the seven seas PERIOD

Ive never seen The Notebook and never plan to because any movie that is slated to make a person cry is a terrible motivator PERIOD Im sure the movie is touching I just prefer violence in my movies PERIOD

I thought it bizarre that everyone I knew had no idea Matilda was a book before a movie until I found out that The Neverending Story is based off a German novel PERIOD

I had so much fun attending my first strip club a couple of months ago that I keep trying to convince my guy friends to take me again PERIOD

I hate the neighbor who lives below me for reasons including that he once listened to Love Shack by the B52s eight times in one day PERIOD

I graduate next semester and have absolutely no idea what Im doing afterwards but I know for sure it will not be in Fresno because the atmosphere suffocates creativity passion and kindness PERIOD

Those are my opinions and this is the Opinion section PERIOD

You all who take the time to get worked up about something that youve read enough to type and send are an angry lot. jeez  you should talk PERIOD  All things considered youre writing a response to justify your job in part which is getting experience for your major while in college PERIOD duh  When you gooff like this or write informational articles about yourself as a central focus  Poodle Skirt Jessica  and put them in a NEWS SOURCE it doesnt look good PERIOD

You are correct though  attacking you for student responses is as dumb as the student responses PERIOD  Fcuk You FresNO Fameless

For those of you who have defended Fresno in comments  Fcuk you TOO PERIOD  Heres the fact  CSUF students are kinda dumb like this because its just Fresno  its not HARVARD PERIOD  I keep saying this yet some people JUST DONT LISTEN  If you were Harvard quality like my cousin from even more podunk Reedley getting a fullride scholarship you would be there PERIOD  But alas youre not and youre stuck here  so make the best of it PERIOD  Might as well become FresYES leave and come back PERIOD  Not you Jessica Im on the same page w you on this point  leave and dont come back. its called Brain Drain PERIOD  I came back to school to finish what I started and thats that for Fresburg for me PERIOD  My brain is drained just by being here and putting up with dumb is as dumber does culture PERIOD  And I have no qualms with saying something against the brainless hometownhoedown culture here PERIOD  The only advantage to Fresno is its easy access to all significant areas of CA in  hours PERIOD

WRITE ABOUT NEWS NOT ABOUT YOU PERIOD  I dont care about you your name etc 
Blockbuster article  okay
Texting article  okay
Whats in a name  NOBODY CARES
KFSR video  Seriously whats the point of the question
You never stated a preface or premise for this question  prompt and then only got a few people to comment usually you might at least want to try and balance it out  maybe pull a stunt like walking INTO the studio and asking an onair DJ if he listens to his own radio station

You have to be creative to grab peoples attention but not a fiction writer like Gomes PERIOD

If youre major is MCJCommunications or whatever then write for your audience its called learning PERIOD  If you want to write in a journal or for therapy  do that  start  a blog or post your frustrations on MySuck PERIOD  I read The Collegian as a break from the daily grind PERIOD  I got into the habit last semester and now Im stuck with it  and some lameducks this semester PERIOD  Hopefully the experience helps w next semester PERIOD

The first part of this article was okay PERIOD  The last part sucked the ending where you leave your readers with your summarized thoughts PERIOD  You left personal Opinions that no one cares about PERIOD  If on the other hand you were to make some interesting oneline observations as Opinions about the stupid nature of the FresnoFamous post that would have gone further than your personal life crp PERIOD  Go figure PERIOD

How is this worthy of print
So maybe BEFORE publishing something actually wasting paper or electrons this question should be asked if something is NEWSWORTHY

I actually emailed and asked if this person hasnt already shared or discussed it w the office my favorite remaining Collegian author about such lameduck articles coming out of The Collegian PERIOD  I figure its for lack of experience or lack of caring PERIOD

If you look at my comments on the ASI  CSSA funding  budget issues I didnt take issue with the writer who WROTE something NEWSWORTHY PERIOD  It didnt even occur to me PERIOD  Thats good writing PERIOD

I also dont interpret the Collegian as a creative writing class in which to swerve through traffic stealthy while on my goddmn cellphone in violation and protest of laws I dont like. its nice to have something to pickup and read thats not the Fresno Bee PERIOD  Its nice to hear campus voices speaking about campus matters PERIOD  I dont care about you all that much PERIOD  Your opinion on a campus matter might interest me though PERIOD

Oh and lets not forget that you have used at least one of your coworkers at least once in your CampusSpeak episodes  and you KNOW you can do better PERIOD

If you dont like the criticism I think you have any of a number of options
. you can just brush it off as a learning experience  and write opinions on matters that matter for students and the school for the school newspaper and leave your personal writing in your journal or personal blog PERIOD
. reach over the counter and smack me if you dont like my words IF you know who I am PERIOD
. improve PERIOD
. tuck Tail  Run for a different major PERIOD

 in Fresno because the atmosphere suffocates creativity passion and kindness. tRUE

 I hate Dane Cook still for his craterface the material he has stolen and the movies he has ruined. i dont know Dane Cook but if I were as spiteful as you sound Id hate you for ruining what was a more interesting CSUF News Source last semester Not the Jessicacentric paper of this semester PERIOD  This is a statement of fact  preference on your part PERIOD

 I had so much fun attending my first strip club a couple of months ago that I keep trying to convince my guy friends to take me again. aGAIN NOBODY CARES 
This is not an Opinion. this is a statement of fact  preference PERIOD  It is like begging for more attention via attempting to entice readers personal to you not for GA PERIOD
FYI  Its just a phase youre behind the 8ball Ms PERIOD Im going to graduate next semester. i think pirates are cooler than ninjas PERIOD They function while drunk and sail the seven seas. this is an opinion PERIOD
Who cares

Why dont you stick to your daynight job  Youre much more entertaining when youre bantering w your coworkers as if nobody is in the store says a lot for me eh but as irritating when youre whining and complaining about something to them PERIOD  Ever notice how nobody likes or appreciates whiners  complainers. charles W PERIOD Frank 									  									Dec   at  am

Oh no negative comments welcome to the Internet PERIOD

And youre in for it if you think the rest of the countryworld is somehow better on the Internet than Fresno PERIOD Good luck getting out of town and getting a good job today though PERIOD

And those might be on the OPINION section but that doesnt mean its worth reading We all have opinions and outlets and what makes yours so much more relevant

I hate when people hide behind the OPINION thing so much PERIOD

Look we all know this is for students to learn how to produce a newspaper so they should be given some slack PERIOD But the Internet is really making things weird for media because the people commenting on stories often know more about the topic than the writers PERIOD News publications need to make sure to stay relevant and valuable PERIOD

Also journalism isnt much of a highpaid profession so that has something to do with it too PERIOD

What a world

I agree the Fresno Famous thing was lame PERIOD But man on the street interviews are kind of lame PERIOD Then again sometimes its good to see what the general public thinks PERIOD Fresno Famous was just looking to complain about Fresno in a seemingly constructive way by saying how lame all those Northside college students are PERIOD Weak

Take things personal much
I guess if you read the post literally youd get the impression I was blaming you singularly or as a couple or however you do your video thing for making students look dumb PERIOD But I think I called out The Collegian as an institution and mostly I was being snarky PERIOD Thats how blogs work welcome to the game PERIOD I realize youre just the messenger in this and that youre just doing your job PERIOD If you reread the Famous post and the comments youll see the comments about the video were really a gateway to a larger discussion about the disconnect between Fresno State students and the cultural vibrancy of the rest of city which is more than you should expect people to get out of one post huh
Anyway
Sorry
