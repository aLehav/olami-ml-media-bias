As the New York primaries approach some NYU upperclassmen have encountered hostility due to their support of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump PERIOD FOX and CNN held live interviews that gave the students an opportunity to air their grievances to a national audience PERIOD Trump supporters they claim accept the fact that people arent going to like them. they fear that when someone comes that goes against their viewpoint they automatically disregard all of that openmindedness and tolerance. regardless of whether or not these feelings of hostility have been embellished or exaggerated strict labeling and rejection of Trump supporters and the swirl of media that has ensued is detrimental to NYU an institution renowned for its free speech social movements and debate PERIOD

While numerous student organizations at NYU are at the forefront of social advocacy the recent spate of media coverage can be seen as a demerit  a sensitive campus struggling to cope and integrate with mainstream political discourse PERIOD As differing ideologies continue to clash it is increasingly important to examine the policies that govern university conduct and discourse PERIOD The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education a nonpartisan nonprofit organization evaluates the constitutionality of U.S PERIOD university policies with Green Yellow or RedLight ratings PERIOD Green Light codes do not seriously imperil speech while a Red Light code both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech PERIOD A clear restriction is one that unambiguously infringes on what is or should be protected expression. nYU should be commended on receiving a Green Light rating for its Guidelines Regarding Protest and Dissent PERIOD This central document governing student conduct comports well with civil liberties Free inquiry free expression and free association are indispensable to the purposes of the University and must be protected as a matter of academic freedom within the University quite apart from the question of constitutional rights. unfortunately NYU is one of many universities with a Red Light rated AntiDiscrimination and AntiHarassment Policy PERIOD The overreaching policy states Examples of actions that constitute prohibited harassment may include but are not limited to verbal abuse or hostile behavior which could include insulting teasing mocking degrading or ridiculing another person or group Ultimately this low rating highlights just how important it is for students to be able to voice their opinions however nasty they may be PERIOD At the same time immediately labeling of a Trump supporter as a racist fascist or simply of low intellect perpetuates the category of brash thought that so many groups have worked to eliminate PERIOD As with everything there is a delicate balance that must be made PERIOD

Students shouldnt be proud of the fact that a minority group whatever its values feel belittled and ridiculed PERIOD While many may be satisfied with the label of a liberal campus a onesided campus where differing viewpoints exist only in whispers prevents robust dialogue and creates a campus quandary that no longer reflects the reality beyond the Square PERIOD In this regard NYU is surprisingly humane in policy but its students still have a long way to go PERIOD
