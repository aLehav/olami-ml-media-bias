The College sits on the ancestral homelands of the StockbridgeMunsee Community PERIOD In his original will the Colleges founder Ephraim Williams Jr. allocated money for the education of the StockbridgeMunsee Community PERIOD Today  years after the founding of the College no members of the StockbridgeMunsee Community have attended the College and there exists no Native American and Indigenous studies department PERIOD We must take concrete steps towards rectifying the brutal history between the College and the StockbridgeMunsee Community PERIOD

In June  I began interning at the StockbridgeMunsee Communitys Tribal Historic Preservation Office THPO on Spring Street PERIOD For those who are unfamiliar with it this office opened fall  in partnership with the Office of Institutional Diversity Equity and Inclusion OIDEI PERIOD For the past few months I have had the opportunity to design a new Mohican history exhibit for the Williamstown Historical Museum create a booklet about Mohican history in Williamstown and work on the repatriation of ancestral remains and cultural artifacts PERIOD These projects along with the opportunity to visit the Tribes reservation and meet many Tribal members have added a layer of depth and perspective to my studies that I would never have gained from my classes alone PERIOD

My projects are just several in a long list recently undertaken by College and community members in hopes of highlighting the history of the StockbridgeMunsee Community PERIOD During a short walk on and around campus one will see a huge Mohican homelands banner above Paresky Center another outside of the  Center for Theatre and Dance and  Mohican homelands lawn signs encircling the roundabout PERIOD This signage is only a small fraction of the work being done PERIOD Students and faculty in the Native American and Indigenous Working Group meet monthly to discuss ongoing campus projects PERIOD Just last week several students presented at Rethinking Place BardonMahicanituck a conference put on by Bard College to honor and learn about those whose homelands the school is on PERIOD One of the most beautiful things I have witnessed since I began interning at THPO is just how many members of the College community are ready willing and excited to learn about the history of the StockbridgeMunsee Community PERIOD

I ask that the Colleges administration match the communitys energy and take advantage of this momentum in two ways PERIOD First by investing in the creation of a Native American and Indigenous studies department PERIOD As it can take many years to create a new academic department the College should as a preliminary step offer more classes on Native American and Indigenous history PERIOD Second as no members of the StockbridgeMunsee Community have attended the College and there are few Native American and Indigenous students currently enrolled the College should work to do more admissions outreach to Native American and Indigenous high school students PERIOD This could come in the form of reaching out to StockbridgeMunsee Community high school students to answer questions about the College and provide help with the application process as well as creating a program similar to Windows on Williams specifically for Native American and Indigenous students PERIOD

I implore all members of the College community who are not aware of the history of the StockbridgeMunsee Community and of the Colleges role in the Tribes forced removal to actively seek out this history PERIOD As we live learn and work on the ancestral homelands of the Mohican people it is critical that we remain cognizant of the fact that we are only here because the Tribe was forcibly removed PERIOD

We must reckon with the fact that Ephraim Williams Jr PERIOD played a key role in the Tribes forced removal and that his harmful legacy remains deeply embedded in our school PERIOD Failure to tell the history of the StockbridgeMunsee Community does a disservice not only to the Tribe but also to all of the Colleges students PERIOD The past five months of engaging with Mohican history have allowed me  for the first time in my career at the College  to feel connected to the land on which I am learning PERIOD Let us become a school that makes knowing the history of whose lands we occupy an integral part of our identity PERIOD We will all be better off for it PERIOD
