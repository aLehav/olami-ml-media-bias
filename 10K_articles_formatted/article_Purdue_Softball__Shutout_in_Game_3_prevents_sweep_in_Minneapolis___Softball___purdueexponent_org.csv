Thenfreshman Alex Echazarreta throws a pitch against Penn State in  PERIOD

Freshman lefthanded pitcher Savanah Henley allowed only one hit in her fourth career start against the Gophers Saturday afternoon a bright spark in a close set of losses on the road PERIOD

In the second win of her college career Henley struck out  batters  one away from the sixth most in program history PERIOD

The third game was the only win for the Boilers in the series against the Gophers due largely to Purdues pitching woes early in the series and struggles to get timely hits PERIOD

After allowing at least one hit in every inning of the first game the bottom of the first inning of the second game took  minutes and three Purdue pitchers PERIOD

It started with a walk followed by a double PERIOD Soon the Gophers hit a double a single and earned three walks to bring the score to  PERIOD

Junior pitcher Brenna Smith made a brief appearance in that span PERIOD She doled out just a fourpitch walk before being replaced with junior Alex Echazarreta who got the out to close the inning and held the Gophers to one more run in the final five innings PERIOD

Pitching improved dramatically for the Boilers in the back half of the series PERIOD In addition to Henleys third game shutout the Gophers only put up two hits in the final game PERIOD

Despite sophomore pitcher Ashley Peters and Henley allowing just two runs from Minnesota in the final game the Boilers lost because they werent able to put up more than one run PERIOD

Throughout the series the Boilers had trouble getting their bats going PERIOD Their problem wasnt getting players on base it was bringing them home PERIOD

Purdue left at least one player stranded in all but one inning of the first game PERIOD The team wasnt able to get as many on base in the following games but the inability to turn hits into runs remained PERIOD

In the seventh inning of the final game for example the Boilers were down  PERIOD Senior leftfielder Ryleigh Scott hit a double deep into center field PERIOD Even with someone in scoring position and only one out Purdue was unable to use that hit to win or even add extra innings PERIOD

Freshman catcher and infielder Kiley Goff though played the best series for hitting of her career this weekend PERIOD In the second game Goff hit her first home run which also let junior shortstop Rachel Becker score and started the ultimately unsuccessful rally PERIOD Indisputably leading the Boilers at bat racking up seven of the  total hits Goff made her way to the top of the batting lineup PERIOD
