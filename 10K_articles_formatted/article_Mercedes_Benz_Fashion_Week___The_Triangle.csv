9462,1970-01-01,"with the conclusion of MercedesBenz Fashion Week Feb PERIOD  and the recent migration of fashion experts from New York to London Fashion Week it is safe to say that the Big Apple is slowly gaining back some normalcy PERIOD Much like the holidays MercedesBenz Fashion Week arrives abruptly spins New York on its back and disappears before you can recognize that it was even there PERIOD Simply put the eightday stretch consists of nonstop show hopping before and afterparties spotting the most epic street style and of course posting every waking second of it on Instagram PERIOD As quickly as it arrives MBFW leaves us with lessons of victories and failures both on and off the runways PERIOD

For those involved in the industry Fashion Week is premeditated by months of anxietyinducing preparation filled with fabric selection model casting and fittings music selection set design and venue aesthetic and promotion PERIOD The preparation and intricate care that each designer must take in the process of collection presentation is encompassed in an eightday whirlwind of eccentric street style waferthin models sauntering down runways and most notably the overall dictation of upcoming trends PERIOD

Despite the inclement weather blanketing the New York City streets droves of fashion moguls and celebrities still managed to make it to the hottest shows of the year PERIOD Luckily the runways were filled with jackets and coats to combat the blustery weather PERIOD Namely Altuzarra provided a plethora of fierce furs that could make even animal rights activists change their views PERIOD Meanwhile Derek Lam offered a stellar selection of unstructured capes  some with a dose of casualness for day and a longer more polished version for night PERIOD

Many antifashion crusaders criticize the extravagance of Fashion Week without knowing its importance PERIOD I too used to raise an eyebrow at the industrys intentions PERIOD In the past I always wondered why those in the industry spent months of preparation and insurmountable amounts of money for a 15minute runway spot PERIOD This year my skepticism was abolished after attending the Tory Burch fashion show at The Pierre  A Taj Hotel on sixty-first Street and 5thAvenue PERIOD I witnessed the dalliances between the design team and their product PERIOD This is a sight that in my opinion has the potential to heavily enthrall those fashion aficionados lucky enough to see it PERIOD This experience has allowed me to realize the importance of every single detail that makes the fashion industry progressively influential and financially successful PERIOD

This year MercedesBenz Fashion Week brought a slew of trends that fashionistas will certainly be sporting PERIOD Detailed textures such as tartan tweed and applique embellishments were frequently shown PERIOD Animal prints are here to stay as the newest and wildest neutral along with the resurgence of exaggerated shapes seen at Theyskens Theory and Jason Wu PERIOD

A concurrent trend was the dismissal of gender stereotypes in the most androgynously structured nod to society accompanied by touches of fur and geometrically sharp shapes PERIOD The Row Rag  Bone and Narciso Rodriguez borrowed from the boys with boxy minimal shapes in textures ranging from houndstooth to tweed that will find a way into your everyday wardrobe PERIOD

Artisanal genius Prabal Gurung is known for taking the female body form into consideration in his designs PERIOD This was exemplified in the first look at Gurungs show an exaggerated peplum top paired with slimcut trousers that will make you fall head over heels in love PERIOD He reworked militarythemed utilitarian structures in deep olive green navy and feminine reds PERIOD Also standing at attention was Michael Kors with his realistic approach on militarianesque pieces and sporty ikat prints and textures PERIOD

On the other end of the spectrum Jason Wu Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg opted for a glammedup extremity of feminism PERIOD Wus models stunned in a bevy of powerfully sexedup leathers pleated skirts and backless haltertops while big hair at Marc Jacobs evoked a glamrock disco straight from the 1970s PERIOD

Tory Burchs ReadytoWear  collection offered rich textures Neue Galerieinspired prints and dragonfly embellishments that embodied an opulent romanticism only Tory Burch could accomplish PERIOD The show took place Feb PERIOD  at The Pierre Hotel which served as the perfect backdrop for the designers ornamentally detailed collection PERIOD

Alexander Wang set the bar high for contemporary fashion with a dark collection accented by fur outerwear in parts both tasteful and brilliantly ambitious PERIOD Wang revamped the typical New York Itgirls playfully chic aesthetic that the young designer is already famous for PERIOD Meanwhile Proenza Schouler struck a perfect balance of mixandmatch graphics textures and angular shapes that conjoined the doses of both the New York uptown and downtown girl PERIOD

Tommy Hilfiger as usual was an explosion of collegiate prep and sport that the American designer is so well known for PERIOD Hilfiger models trumped down the runway in miniskirts doublebreasted blazers and of course the perfect touch of houndstooth and plaid PERIOD Overall berrytart hues were seen on various runways including Narciso Rodriguez Marc Jacobs and Anna Sui PERIOD Keep an eye out for candycolored ensembles and detailed graphics and textures for the upcoming months PERIOD",Mercedes Benz Fashion Week - The Triangle,Drexel University
