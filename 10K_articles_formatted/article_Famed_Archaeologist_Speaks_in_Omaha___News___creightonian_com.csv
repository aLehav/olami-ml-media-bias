A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Archaeological Institute of Americas AIA annual Joukowsky Lectureship will take place on Feb PERIOD  in the Abbott Lecure Hall of the Joslyn Art Museum PERIOD

Brian Rose the Ph.D James B PERIOD Pritchard Professor of Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania will present Assessing the Historicity of the Trojan War Excavations at Troy . the lecture is free and open to the public PERIOD

Rose will discuss the results of the Bronze Age Greek and Roman excavations at Troy  a site made famous by Homers   during the last  years PERIOD Erin Averett president of the OmahaLincoln AIA organization had great things to say about Rose PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Rose is one of the best speakers I have ever heard Averett said PERIOD He is really good at knowing his audience and making the topic come alive PERIOD It promises to be a really fantastic lecture I think. these lectures are a great way to get great speakers  like the internationally famous Rose  to come to Omaha normally one would have to go somewhere like New York to see speakers like these Averett said PERIOD

According to Susie Severson director of adult programs at Joslyn Art Museum students interested in the humanities and members of the general public benefit from AIA lectures because the programs shed light on contemporary issues in the field of archeology PERIOD

AIA presentations expose visitors to extraordinary digs advancing technologies and bring awareness to the importance of protecting the cultural heritage of the people around the world Severson said PERIOD AIA lectures encourage us to contemplate our place in the world who we are why were here and what the future may hold. gretchen Stricker and Paige Bockman cosecretaries of the local AIA chapter both stressed the importance of studying archaeology PERIOD

Archaeology gives us a look into the past and helps fill gaps in the historical record Stricker said PERIOD It is a way to learn about the complexity of different societies what made them great and how they fell. bockman added that studying archaeology is an important factor in putting to rest some of our greatest misconceptions PERIOD

Ive been in a few history and theology classes that still insist the Egyptian pyramids were built by slaves which archaeological evidence disproved years ago Bockman said PERIOD

As if those reasons for delving into archeology arent enough Creighton alumnus Brian Martens added that archeologists use objects and remains to answer all sorts of questions PERIOD That is why Martens finds archaeology so fascinating there is always something to learn and know PERIOD

Its the trill of discovering an answer or contributing a piece of knowledge to the puzzle Martens said PERIOD With the study of material culture these discoveries are tangible  archaeology offers us very real access to past civilizations. creighton Students are encouraged to mark Feb PERIOD  off on their calendars to attend this lecture PERIOD

They the lectures are only about an hour long and are a good break from studyingThese lectures are not intense or deeply theoretical so anyone of any level of interest in archaeology can understand and enjoy them. a lot of the topics that will be discussed are interesting even if you dont want to do it as a career Averett said it is an opportunity to expand your horizons and learn something new PERIOD

The Joslyn helps make this a better lecture series and I am very thankful for that Averett said PERIOD

The lecture begins at  p.m PERIOD Students attending the lecture should arrive early because the lectures draw a sizable crowd and the Abbott Lecture Hall fills quickly PERIOD
