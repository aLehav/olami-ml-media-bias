Anderson picked up his fourth foul near the under15 timeout and had  points before he had to sub out PERIOD He has reached doublefigure scoring in three of the last four games PERIOD

He did a nice job particularly when you look at his points Eastern coach Jay Spoonhour said PERIOD But defensively he was pretty good and rebounded PERIOD It was a tough shooting night for us. anderson also led the Panthers with six rebounds PERIOD

Junior guard AJ Riley and freshman forward Patrick Muldoon were also able to reach doublefigure scoring PERIOD Riley finished with  points while Muldoon had a careerhigh  points for the game PERIOD

Throughout the game Marshall used a fastpaced offense to grab some big runs including a  run to start the game before the first media timeout PERIOD The Herd led by as much as  points midway through the second half  before Anderson reentered PERIOD

Junior forward Ryan Taylor led the Herd with  points while Marshalls secondbest scorer did not start the game PERIOD Guard CJ Burks came off the bench and scored  points including  in the first half PERIOD A total of five Marshall players reached doublefigure scoring PERIOD

They are trying to get it and go and take off right away Spoonhour said PERIOD We did a really nice job making them pass it sometimes fivetosix times PERIOD Its a big deal. the loss moves the Panthers to  on the season while the Herd picked up their fist win Wednesday PERIOD
