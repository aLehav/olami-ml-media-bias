4100,2014-04-03,"after struggling for much of the first month of the season the No PERIOD  UCSB womens water polo team has officially found its form PERIOD

With just five total Big West games over the remainder of the season Santa Barbara will be home for its first conference home game this Saturday when it plays No PERIOD  Hawaii PERIOD

The Gauchos have improved to an overall record of  and  in the Big West thanks to their current fivegame winning streak including a  victory over No PERIOD  UC Davis last weekend PERIOD The Rainbow Wahine are currently on a threegame losing streak which has dropped them to  overall and  in conference play PERIOD

To start off Big West with a win was really exciting for our team sophomore utility Holly Smith said PERIOD We had a rough week with the passing of our fellow water polo Gaucho Nick Johnson so we all came together for this game and it was the best that we all worked together so far this season. the Gauchos were excellent defensively in the win over Davis holding the Aggies to just four goals the lowest amount that the Gauchos have allowed any ranked opponent this year PERIOD

Our defense basically shut down any kind of offense they tried to run and we were all really on the same page Smith said PERIOD The most important thing for us was the fact that we were all able to play as a team PERIOD We were all really confident so hopefully we will continue to win against Hawaii on Saturday. when Hawaii comes to town it will bring with it one of the most outstanding offensive duos in the country in sophomore attacker Paula Chillida Esforzado and senior utility Danielle Lewis PERIOD Esforzado leads her team both in goals  and assists  in just  games while Lewis has scored  goals on a teamhigh . shooting percentage PERIOD

Were really hoping to play very similar to what we did last weekend sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw said PERIOD Were a super young team and we were kind of scattered at the beginning of the year but now were all developing and knowing each others strengths so we can work together really well PERIOD Were excited. uCSBs defense has carried them in the last month PERIOD After allowing over . goals per game through their first  games the Gauchos have decreased that number down to just . per game in their last five wins PERIOD

We want to play exactly how we played against Davis PERIOD That was our best game by far and if we continue to play like that then we shouldnt have a problem beating Hawaii Smith said PERIOD Each game we play we hit another milestone and every game we get a little bit better PERIOD Were just continuing to progress and thats really exciting to be able to watch the team change and see that all the hard work is paying off. the Gauchos take on Hawaii this Saturday at noon at Campus Pool PERIOD
