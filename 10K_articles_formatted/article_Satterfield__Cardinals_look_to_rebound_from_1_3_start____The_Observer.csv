Ellen Geyer  Friday October  

Even though its only been about a month its already been a long season for Louisville PERIOD

The Cardinals are  overall and  in the ACC sitting in last place in the conference courtesy of a threegame losing streak PERIOD After a  outofconference win against Western Kentucky to open up play Louisville dropped threestraight with a sizable  loss No PERIOD  Miami a closecall  defeat from No PERIOD  Pittsburgh and a  rout by unranked Georgia Tech PERIOD The seasons start is the programs worst since  PERIOD

Despite a disappointing first few weeks head coach Scott Satterfield is optimistic about whats to come PERIOD

We are still young in the program with this coaching staff PERIOD Its an everyday process that were going through and its really just talking about literally going through the process of becoming a championshipcaliber team he said PERIOD Its about habits its about commitment its about what youre doing on a daily basis and you just cant show up  any of us cant just show up all of a sudden when its time to shine and think youre going be really good PERIOD It doesnt work that way PERIOD We are constantly reiterating the fact that we have to show up every day  were still growing. satterfield is in his second year at the helm of the program having recorded a record of   ACC in his first PERIOD Across the two seasons theres been consistency at the quarterback position with the offensive reins residing in the hands of Malik Cunningham PERIOD Despite setting the school record for pass efficiency in  with a rating of . cunningham has struggled across the first month of play PERIOD In four games he has recorded as many interceptions as he did over the course of the entire season last year  five PERIOD Satterfield expressed his frustration with the senior but asserted that more players than just his quarterback have a hand in the teams offensive struggles PERIOD

Maliks overthrown a few of them but it seems like theres been something different as the source of each offensive struggle whether it be Malik not throwing the proper ball or the receiver not running the proper route or the Oline or tight ends not protecting Satterfield said PERIOD In the course of the season its been a little bit of everybody I think that have attributed to some of those shots not being there PERIOD But I think Maliks got to be able to hit some of those balls. he went on to express that the biggest differences between this season and the last are two issues of no small importance PERIOD

I think the turnovers and big plays are the two biggest differences on offense that I think weve had he said PERIOD We have to take care of the football and we have to get down the field PERIOD If we hit those big plays were going to score points  thats how we will be able to win football games. the Cardinals have allowed  sacks for  yards and recorded nine fumbles six of which were lost to contribute to a total of  turnovers on the season PERIOD Satterfield acknowledged however that the picture isnt much brighter defensively despite losing just three starters in the offseason PERIOD

Its not been good tackling and its still not PERIOD I mean you can teach tackling and you can work on it and we do he said PERIOD We work on it all the time PERIOD But when youre playing the game of football theres so many variables involved with it Its angles its the point wherever Im hitting the guy am I trying to wrap up or am I just trying to go in with the shoulder Also what kind of makeup am I as a player  All those things are involved with that and were not where we need to be obviously in regards to that PERIOD So theres a lot we got to get better at with that he said PERIOD But weve got to be more aggressive with it. the problems of the Cardinals extend beyond tackling as Louisville is ranked  in the ACC defensively having given up an average of . points in their first four games PERIOD But with struggles on both sides of the ball Satterfield expressed the importance of getting better as an entire team unit PERIOD

Were all in this thing together PERIOD Our staff understands that  our guys have always been that way he said PERIOD Part of what I think makes a great program is when you have great chemistry on the staff and guys work well together PERIOD You put your ego to the side and we all know that were in this thing together as one PERIOD  Were in here trying to do everything we can to find any way to help on each side of the ball and on special teams to find ways to win or some advantage against whoever were playing. looking ahead to his teams road trip to South Bend this weekend Satterfield cited the importance of using a matchup against fifthranked Notre Dame as a learning experience PERIOD

I think for us its not about Notre Dame he said PERIOD Its about us in this building and how well we can go out and prepare this week to play this game and then go out and actually execute and play the game the way we prepared PERIOD I think thats probably the biggest thing PERIOD Whether we win or whether we lose whatever the score is to me whats going to help make this season for us is that we are coming out and were planning the way we need to be playing and taking care of the football PERIOD  Theyre obviously an outstanding football team topfive team every year it seems like in the country PERIOD It is a big challenge but to me and for our guys and our staff and our team is more about us and how we can go execute and just play at a much better level. share This Story
