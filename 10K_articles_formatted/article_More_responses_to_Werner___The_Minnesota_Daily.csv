Don Werners letter to the editor that was published on Monday is a perfect example of why I fear a religiously fervent conservative administration for our country PERIOD I not only disagree with Werners opinions about abortion and gay marriage but I am more concerned with the prominence given to these topics by many voters and politicians PERIOD The thought of leaders who emphasize the denial of rights of marginalized groups such as women and homosexuals as major campaign points over the increasingly more pressing problems that require our immediate actions is extremely distressing PERIOD Recently globally important issues such as the economy the wars and the dangerous depletion of resources have not been sufficiently dealt with by our government PERIOD The upcoming election has so much at stake PERIOD For many of us this is our first chance to have a say in what happens in the democratic process and I for one am very excited to make my voice heard PERIOD So lets use our right to vote to elect officials who will focus on the most urgent matters and who will fix global crises instead of fixating on religious dogmas PERIOD Britt Paulson University Student Registered Voter This is in response to Don Werners letter to the editor titled Voting on Abortion and Gay Marriage  PERIOD Mr PERIOD Werners letter completely ignores the fact that our country is one that provides its citizens with freedom of and from religion not to mention the fact that our country operates on the basis of separation of church and state PERIOD People are free to live in this country without having someone elses religious beliefs or doctrine imposed upon them PERIOD People like Mr PERIOD Werner have turned this political election into a mudslinging campaign designed to trash the opposing side rather than talk about what they plan to do to improve our country PERIOD His letter assumes that the only people who can vote right are those who base their decision on Gods absolute moral values on divine law PERIOD Now aside from the fact that this divine law he speaks of is obviously aimed at one religious group and therefore alienates thousands of Americans who are either not religious or choose to express their freedom of religious choice this letter manages to use the Bible and the teachings of a religious group as a weapon of hate against an entire part of society PERIOD What kind of divine law is that I apologize if the kind of family I support is the kind that is based on love and a mutual desire for the members of said family to be happy I didnt realize that a persons gender was such a crucial factor in their ability to raise a family PERIOD I guess the nine years of experience I have in child care and the many families Ive worked with that continue to ask me to be a part of their childrens lives have failed to realize what a detriment I am to the traditional family simply because I am a lesbian PERIOD I didnt want to write this letter so that I could say how unfounded I think Mr PERIOD Werners comments are I wrote this because Im curious if mine are thoughts that ever crossed his mind when he sent this letter in PERIOD I have tried to remain a respectful as I can in considering Mr PERIOD Werners point of view which is a lot more than I can say for him but Im finding it increasingly more difficult to do as I continue to read his letter PERIOD His blatant disregard for the value of human life the same crime he accuses the prochoice not proabortion and promarriage equality candidates of committing mind you is sickening PERIOD Id like to know which of these absolute moral standards Mr PERIOD Werner is representing when he condemns an entire portion of society and refuses to acknowledge their value as human beings deserving of the same right to feel safe and protected in this country as he has PERIOD Something Im sure Mr PERIOD Werner didnt even think to consider when submitting his hypocritical letter to the editor is that this happens to be National Coming Out Week a week in which people are supposed to be celebrated for having the courage to come out  whether it be as a member of the GLBT community or even an ally who is proud to show their support to the community PERIOD I find it very disappointing that in a time when we should be encouraging people to be comfortable with who they are and providing them with the support to do so we are instead being reminded of the people who think that doing just that being happy with who you are is grounds to be considered an abomination. i truly hope that the hurtful words of people like Mr PERIOD Werner do not have a negative impact on this week PERIOD There is no shame in being proud of who you are the only shame is in putting down those who have found just that and chosen to embrace it PERIOD Emily Rence CEHD Student
