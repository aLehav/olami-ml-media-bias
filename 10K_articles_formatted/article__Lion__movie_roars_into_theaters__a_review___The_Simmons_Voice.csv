Lion director Garth Davis feature film debut tells the nearly impossible true story of a man on a journey to find a home he can barely remember

At the Oscars on Sunday Feb PERIOD  it will contend for five awardsBest Picture Best Supporting Actor Best Supporting Actress Best Adapted Screenplay Best Original Score and Best Cinematography PERIOD

Luke Davies adapted the screenplay from Saroo Brierleys  memoir A Long Way Home which details Brierleys attempts to find his family in India after over  years of separation and his adoption by an Australian family PERIOD

In Lion the audience sees Brierley in two stages of his life first as a fiveyearold in India then at  in Australia PERIOD Eightyearold Sunny Pawar plays the young Brierley and steals the screen in his firstever acting role PERIOD

Brierley was born in Khandwa India and lived there with his family for the first five years of his life before abruptly being ripped away from them over the course of a single night PERIOD

While waiting for his older brother on a train platform late into the night Brierley mistakenly boards a train bound for Calcutta some  miles away PERIOD The people of Calcutta primarily speak Bengali rather than Hindi leaving Brierley effectively stranded and unable to communicate that hes lost PERIOD

After being homeless for several months and then being moved to an orphanage Saroo is adopted by Sue Nicole Kidman and John David Wenham Brierley a married couple from Tasmania Australia PERIOD

Twenty years later Saroo now a young man studying hospitality in Melbourne is consumed by thoughts of the family in India he never intended to leave behind PERIOD

After telling his friends and girlfriend Lucy Rooney Mara that hes adopted they suggest that he use the recentlyinvented Google Earth to search for his village in Khandwa PERIOD

The implausibility of that discovery would make it difficult for the audience to suspend their disbelief if Lion wasnt based on Brierleys nonfiction memoir PERIOD

Instead knowing his quest is an adaption of a real mans life makes Lion resonant and moving PERIOD In films climax Brierley desperately scrolls and clicks at his laptop while he searches the Indian countryside for a landmark thats familiar to him PERIOD

Although he is nominated in the supporting actor category Dev Patel is truly a leading man as the grown Saroo PERIOD He has less to work with plotwise than Pawarthe melancholy of the films second act is subtler and less actiondriven than the first PERIOD Nonetheless his struggle to reconcile memories of his family in India with his adult life in Australia is captivating PERIOD

Lions subject matter could easily push it into clich but the charisma of both Pawar and Patel combined with the biographical plot steers it firmly into inspirational territory PERIOD
