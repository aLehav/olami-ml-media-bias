Researchers at Washington State University are studying a new way of going green on a nano level PERIOD

We are investigating how changes at the nano scale allow for the development of new materials said Steven Saunders head researcher on the study and WSU assistant professor in the Gene and Linda Voiland School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering PERIOD Saunders is in his second year of teaching at WSU and is designing green catalytic processes using nanotechnology PERIOD

To put the nano size into perspective a baseball compared to the earth is the same difference between the baseball and the materials Saunders and his students work with PERIOD The particles are minuscule bits of matter that have vastly different properties than their larger versions PERIOD

For example large pieces of the element gold do not react with any other matter which is why gold makes great jewelry PERIOD However when gold is very small it is no longer yellow PERIOD Instead it is a red wine color PERIOD Not only does the color change but the electrical magnetic  and specifically what Saunders and his researchers are interested in  catalytic properties change PERIOD

A catalyst expedites chemical reactions and minimizes the formation of byproducts Saunders said PERIOD

A good example of this is pharmaceuticals PERIOD Making a pure drug is difficult PERIOD Many processes require a catalyst to speed up the reaction and to prevent the formation of byproducts PERIOD If byproducts are made during the manufacturing of the drug then the drug itself will be more expensive due to the need to purify it Saunders said PERIOD

This research is attempting to understand the chemistry and the physics at the surface of these particles PERIOD Researchers are looking to use these particles for catalytic purposes as well as recover and reuse the particles without producing waste PERIOD By recovering nano particles after a catalytic reaction researchers could reduce the amount of waste and cost of some synthetic products PERIOD

The chemicals surrounding the nanoparticles are invisible to microscopes so I use a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and fluid mechanics to investigate the structural changes that occur during the recovery of thenano particles said Trent Graham graduate student and researcher PERIOD

Shane R PERIOD Reynolds graduate student and research assistant said the goal for this research is to understand the interactions between neutral molecules on the surface of nano particles with water or an organic solvent mixture PERIOD By doing this researchers hope to achieve better nano particle separation and recovery PERIOD

To keep up with the lab research graduate students read the latest research in their field and set up the experiments PERIOD The students then collect the data and craft research papers PERIOD

I am typically sizing the nano particles interpreting their concentration based on light absorbance data or comparing different treatments to the particles for use in our pressure vessel Reynolds said PERIOD

The research idea and procedure is Saunders and he works with his graduate students to carry out much of the work PERIOD

WSU is unique in this field because of the level of students Saunders said PERIOD
