Though the start of the Kansas legislative session is still a month away legislators are beginning to prioritize and consider issues that may come up including the budget and voter registration PERIOD For Lawrencearea representatives and senators this means paying attention to the needs of students PERIOD

Revisions to the fiscal year  budget which runs from July   to June   will be a major issue during the session because the state must make up a  million shortage in funds PERIOD Any changes to the tax code would take effect too late to solve the problem which means the money must be made up through other revenue or by cutting budgets PERIOD For Senator Marci Francisco and Representative Barbara Ballard legislators from Lawrence the University is going to be a huge concern when deciding what to cut PERIOD

Ballard said she worried that education would be cut because it makes up more than  percent of the budget PERIOD The large block of money that education receives makes it an obvious but unfortunate choice for cuts PERIOD

Its a very simple reason why you go there Ballard said PERIOD Its the only place PERIOD Its where the bulk of the money is PERIOD Where else can you cut When some people are getting five percent seven percent you cant go cut them PERIOD You have to cut where the bulk of the money is and thats where the concern comes in how are you going to cut

Ballard said many have suggested cutting transportation but she believes it would be unwise to cut funding to a department that brings in revenue PERIOD

Why would you cut a source thats making money for you People will say Oh but transportation she said PERIOD Well transportation also pays for itself PERIOD We pay the tolls PERIOD We generate the money PERIOD We can take that money and go back and put in the roads. through the recession and into recent years Kansas has faced a tight budget which means it will be a challenge to make yet another cut to budgets across the state Francisco said PERIOD

I think at this point were going to have to say Which services can we cut not just take another acrosstheboard cut she said PERIOD

Ballard and Francisco both attributed the shortfall to the tax cuts implemented in  PERIOD Both said  Kansas businesses were exempted from paying income tax and Francisco suggested that a longterm solution to the fall in revenue must include a look at the tax codes including those cuts PERIOD

We are not probably going to have the money to cover all the expenses that I think the state should take responsibility for she said PERIOD

A shortterm solution could be making payments to schools and other departments in July instead of June because they would fall into the next fiscal year PERIOD However Francisco said this would be a patch in an ongoing problem PERIOD

The projected budget shortfall will be worse next year said Ballard who added that making late payments may help through the fiscal year but could also mean credit downgrades in addition to the two the state has faced PERIOD Each credit downgrade makes it more expensive for agencies to use bonds to fund projects PERIOD

If you have good credit you can borrow a loan at at a lower rate Ballard said PERIOD If your credit is not as good you have to pay a higher rate in order to borrow your money PERIOD When they downgraded us twice were into that category PERIOD We have to pay more money in order to get our credit. the governor will propose a budget for the remainder of this fiscal year and the one to follow prior to the start of the legislative session PERIOD Following his proposals the legislature will be able to look into possible solutions including the ones suggested in Governor Brownbacks budget PERIOD

The upcoming legislative session will mean a variety of topics to be talked about including others that may pertain to students PERIOD While proofofcitizenship requirements were a topic of interest for several student groups this fall they may not be a huge concern in the legislature this spring PERIOD Francisco expressed concern with the system the state uses to acquire the proof of citizenship PERIOD She said Secretary of State Kris Kobach as part of his legislative testimony said those with drivers licenses would be assumed to have provided proof of citizenship and not have to do such again PERIOD

Other issues include expanding KanCare the private system that handles Medicare and Medicaid in Kansas and gun legislation PERIOD A proposed expansion of Medicare would be provided completely by federal funding or at least  percent by federal funding according to Ballard PERIOD

Francisco said a major concern at universities including the University of Kansas will be opencarry of firearms on campus PERIOD The University and the city have two years to install safety checkpoints at entrances to public buildings or prepare to allow opencarry of firearms on campus PERIOD

It is a requirement now that any public building will have to either have a way to guarantee that they can check for guns to check that people arent bringing in guns or they will have to allow guns she said PERIOD The difficulty for the University is checkpoints at every public entrance PERIOD Are we going to say you can have opencarry of guns on campus How will that make people feel. the legislation passed two years ago granted the University four years to comply PERIOD

The legislature is currently adjourned but will reconvene Jan PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD
