7225,2023-10-31,"library hosts interdisciplinary panel on opioid epidemic

On Thursday Nov PERIOD  over  students and community members gathered for an interdisciplinary presentation about Americas opioid epidemic from four professors PERIOD

The panelists were Professor Chrysan Cronin Director of Public Health Dr PERIOD Jeremy Teissere Professor and Director of the Neuroscience Department Dr PERIOD Kate Richmond Associate Professor of Psychology and Rachel Hamelers Science Librarian PERIOD

Cronin led off with a presentation about the epidemic in its broadest sense PERIOD

Opioids are a class of drugs that are used to reduce pain which can also produce a euphoric experience for the user that extends beyond the pain relief PERIOD These drugs are often prescribed legally like oxycodone codeine morphine and fentanyl for example PERIOD

Concerns arise with respect to either illicit consumption manufacturing and sales in the case of fentanyl or when it is rendered into a recreational drug like heroin in  over  million Americans misused prescription opioids and there were approximately  overdose deaths involving opioids PERIOD

But the magnitude of Americas opioid crisis is not limited to the addict Cronin noted and that is where public health figures into the puzzle PERIOD

In public health we look past the addict PERIOD We think about the families and communities because it places a strain on a variety of government and nongovernment organizations said Cronin PERIOD Some of those organizations include healthcare systems social services police departments prisons and even the economy  the annual impact of the epidemic is . billion Cronin added PERIOD

Some of the current public health interventions include advocating for methadone treatment program and safe injection sites as well as new prescribing guidelines and labeling requirements PERIOD Cronin concluded by acknowledging that although there are interventions available we absolutely need to do a better job of ensuring access. teissere spoke about the science of opioids and their physiological effects on humans PERIOD

Some opioids are more fat soluble than others which allows them to pass through the bloodbrain barrier more efficiently Teissere said PERIOD Some can remain in the body for weeks which contributes to longerlasting effects and a detectability similar to cannabis. but these longerlasting effects can also contribute to a condition known as opioidinduced hyperalgesia which occurs when endorphin signaling in the brain alters the way the individual processes pain PERIOD This increased tolerance means that the affected individual feels more pain when an opioid is not actually in their body PERIOD

Teissere also explained an interesting relationship between opioid tolerance and the environment in which they are consumed PERIOD Essentially if the individual goes to an identical location to consume opioids their body remembers the act of traveling and physiologically speaking anticipates consumption PERIOD This process heightens the effects of hyperalgesia leading the individual to seek new methods of consumption  either the location or type of opioid  that their body is less sensitized to PERIOD

These drugs are changing our bodys memory which may also alter the environment in which the drugs are taken said Teissere PERIOD

In moving from neuroscience to psychology Richmond discussed how the biopsychosocial model is affecting the opioid epidemic in the United States PERIOD

The truth is that people around the world have pain PERIOD The United States is the only country dealing with a crisis of this magnitude said Richmond PERIOD What is it about American culture that has contributed to this epidemic

Richmond explained that stressors like economic recessions and subsequent job loss contribute to an individuals lack of personal identity this is compounded by the lack of social services available for the disabled pregnant and elderly when compared with other developed countries PERIOD

According to Richmond our country stigmatizes and places barriers to accessing mental health treatment PERIOD This leads individuals to seek pain medication to treat pain which often is the physical manifestation of stress and could otherwise be addressed with more robust mental health infrastructure Richmond said PERIOD

I think of this crisis as one of mental health and not of solely addiction said Richmond PERIOD But therapy takes time and is expensive PERIOD Pills have always been a quick solution. richmond believes that addressing some of the underlying stressors of American culture  war political issues and economic concerns  lies at the heart of actually addressing the opioid crisis PERIOD

The last panelist to present was Hamelers who addressed scientific literacy and its role in the epidemic PERIOD

The United States is the only country dealing with a crisis of this magnitude PERIOD

In the 1980s Hamelers said prescribing habits in the United States changed dramatically following a letter to the editor in the New England Journal of Medicine PERIOD The correspondence which was not a clinical trial or epidemiological study stated that among  patients at the Boston University Medical Center receiving narcotics only four were considered addicted PERIOD

In the following decades the letter has been cited thousands of times by pharmaceutical companies and physicians alike to justify prescribing synthetically produced opioids PERIOD

The pharmaceutical companies were not concerned about the patients or the science they were concerned about the profits said Hamelers PERIOD

In April the Department of Health and Human Services outlined a fivepoint plan to address the opioid epidemic and two components are related to data collection and research the Trump Administration has also recently declared the crisis a public health emergency PERIOD

Specifically Hamelers argued that it will be essential to designate federal money to actual prevention and treatment strategies instead of an antiopioid just say no campaign akin to the 1980s War on Drugs PERIOD This is probably not the best way to spend our public health dollars said Hamelers PERIOD It wont work. although the panelists come from different academic backgrounds they agreed that the opioid epidemic has resulted from a variety of intersecting societal and physiological issues PERIOD Ultimately it will be up to the public health and healthcare communities to earnestly address the crisis and help the millions of Americans who desperately need assistance PERIOD

Opioid Addiction Is a Huge Problem but Pain Prescriptions Are Not the Cause

But the simple reality is this According to the large annually repeated and representative National Survey on Drug Use and Health  percent of all opioid misuse starts with people using medication that wasnt prescribed for themobtained from a friend family member or dealer PERIOD
