Female students at the University of Connecticut are contacting the Mansfield Police Department over concerns about a fake survey regarding breast cancer on the Buy or Sell UConn Tickets Facebook page that prompted participants to dress provocatively for an online breast examination. the announcement about the survey which has since been deleted was posted by a UConn student PERIOD She later posted that her account had been hacked by an unidentified person and that the post nor the associated survey was hers PERIOD The student could not be reached for comment at the time of publication PERIOD

They the researchers are conducting a research study looking at how breast features like size and shape can lead to higher or lower risk of cancer the post read PERIOD The study they are doing is completely online and involves just taking a few surveys PERIOD For doing the study you can get up to  in gift cards to Target or Amazon. a female student who wishes to remain anonymous said she received an email with instructions on how to set up Google Hangouts so the second part of the study could proceed PERIOD The sender said the app is completely automated and would walk the student through all the necessary measurements PERIOD

It works best if you are wearing something tight fitting with your best fitting bra the message said PERIOD It would also best to have other bras handy in case it asks you to change. the student said she did not think much of the study until the instructions suggested she take the measurements a bit further PERIOD

Basically there were prompts and I had to turn to the side like one of those bra measuring apps she said PERIOD Then it prompted me to take my top off which I obviously didnt do PERIOD It gave me numbers which I assumed were for the study. the student said she felt uneasy after seeing other girls commenting on the Facebook post with similar concerns about the part two instructions PERIOD

Alexis Angelini a fifthsemester English and communications double major said she completed the first part of the survey which was a Google Form that appeared normal and professional PERIOD

I was a little skeptical but most of the questions were seemingly medical or least the ones Id expect from a survey of this nature Angelini said PERIOD Asking about nerve pain in breasts size shape any back pain history of cancer. angelini said when she completed part one of the survey there were directions to contact a woman by the name of Lilly Parkers to continue with part two of the experiment PERIOD

I email her saying Im interested and then I get the information that Id need to do a Google

Hangout with a random person and have them examine my breasts Angelini said PERIOD

Julia Santos a seventhsemester communications major said part one also seemed relatively normal to her and that she did not attempt to take the second part PERIOD

It asked for a password to use and Im glad that I decided not to use my regular password and made one just for the survey Santos said PERIOD I wonder what they wouldve done if I had gone into Google Hangouts Is this some weird steal your login data or steal your breast information Would they have asked for pictures later

The original poster who is a UConn student later posted in the page and said an individual had gotten into her account and posted the message in an attempt to lure girls in PERIOD

My account was hacked by an unknown person the post read PERIOD A lot of people have expressed concern relating to the study and their personal information may have been taken as a result. the student then offered help and support for anyone who believes they may have fallen victim to the scam PERIOD

If you have participated in the studyare concerned please comment or message me personally the post read PERIOD I have contacted an officer on behalf of those that may be concerned and depending on the number of people that may be concerned an investigation will take place where higher authorities will pursue the matter. the Mansfield police officer in charge of the case could not be reached for comment PERIOD

Angelini said the entire scandal is concerning for the massive number of university women who assumed the survey was safe given that it was on UConns student page PERIOD

The whole thing is gross and disgusting Angelini said PERIOD Hundreds of girls responded to the survey. the anonymous student said she will be closely monitoring the situation to make sure the participants are safe PERIOD

I just really hope this gets figured out she said PERIOD The web is a scary place and I hope no one actually took their bra off for this. taylor Harton is a campus correspondent for The Daily Campus PERIOD They can be reached via email at taylor.hartonuconn.edu PERIOD
