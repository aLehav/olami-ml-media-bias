By  Matt KnutsonFebruary  

More than  people gathered Friday night at the Convocation Center for a honkytonk singalong PERIOD

Brooks  Dunn fans flocked to the arena for the first concert sellout in the arenas history PERIOD

From the start Brooks  Dunn encouraged the audience to get out of their seats and participate PERIOD

There werent any giveaways at the door but throughout the show Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn kept the audience involved by throwing as many things into the crowd as possible PERIOD

Cowboy hats water bottles Tshirts and drum sticks were some of the paraphernalia thrown to the fans PERIOD

Jaquelyn Spraker drove  hours from Tulsa Okla. just to see Brooks  Dunn perform PERIOD

I got hit in the head with a drum stick by Ronnie Dunn and I didnt even get to keep it PERIOD Regardless it was a great show Spraker said PERIOD

The audience wasnt the typical college crowd PERIOD

Oak Forest resident Diana Vandenoever attended the show with her daughterinlaw two daughters and two granddaughters PERIOD

Every time Brooks  Dunn comes to town I go and see them PERIOD I love their entertainment Vandenoever said PERIOD

Our main focus is the students PERIOD We are going to keep booking shows that cater to them Selover said PERIOD When a country show comes to DeKalb the community responds. selover said the community response also benefits local businesses PERIOD

It wasnt only a success for the university but for the community as well PERIOD Any time you get 6000plus people in town it benefits the hotels and the restaurants Selover said PERIOD
