Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

For many soontobe graduates there is a great deal of pressure to follow an extremely strict pathway PERIOD However while graduates often enter the workforce soon after graduation this is neither the only path available nor better PERIOD There are a number of alternatives a graduate can choose many of which can help a new graduate stand out when applying for a job later on in life PERIOD

Eva Lovelace graduated from Cal Poly in  with a degree in psychology PERIOD Feeling unsure about where she wanted to attend graduate school or if she even wanted to go at all Lovelace decided to make the monumental decision to go abroad PERIOD By her final quarter at Cal Poly she had finalized her plans to travel to Spain to pursue rock climbing and become an au pair PERIOD

Deciding to go abroad

I wanted an adventure Lovelace said PERIOD I had originally planned to go for just six months but ended up staying for several years. when Lovelace made her decision to go abroad after graduation she was excited and scared PERIOD She knew she wanted a challenge but occasionally experienced selfdoubt which stemmed from not following in the footsteps of her fellow graduates PERIOD

Occasionally I felt nervous about making such a big change when there were other what I thought were easier options out there after graduation Lovelace said PERIOD

Support behind the decision

Many students are terrified what their friends or family may think if they chose not to go straight into the workforce PERIOD Lovelace experienced pressure from her friends and family to have a plan after college but no one criticized the plan she chose for herself PERIOD

I received a lot of support and I think generally people see the value in these sorts of experiences Lovelace said PERIOD

Traveling abroad on your own holds a great deal of valuable experience that not only benefits an individuals character but also benefits their potential to stand out among their competitors when searching for a job as well PERIOD

Lovelace said traveling taught her about who she was as a person PERIOD

It took traveling to the other side of the world for me to learn how to trust in my own instincts and discover what truly holds meaning for me personally Lovelace said PERIOD

Standing out in grad school applications

When Lovelace returned to the U.S PERIOD ready to start graduate school she stood out among the other prospective students PERIOD

Youd be surprised by how much more relatable and memorable you are to others which can make a difference when youre up against a huge stack of other peoples resumes and applications PERIOD It took me a while to realize this but people truly value what I consider intangible human skills skills that cant be learned by rote memorization and studying but rather by practice and experience Lovelace said PERIOD

However at first Lovelaces experience wasnt as magical as she had envisioned it PERIOD Albeit tough her challenges never prompted her to abandon her plans they only made her work harder to achieve what she wished for her new life in Spain PERIOD

Lovelace said one of her most important experiences abroad happened in the first month she was living in Madrid PERIOD Originally she was meant to be nanny to three children and help the family learn English PERIOD However things did not go according to plan PERIOD

I was immediately unhappy with the arrangement and knew I needed to leave PERIOD However it never crossed my mind to move back to the United States I felt like I was there and needed to figure this out Lovelace said PERIOD Over the course of two weeks I moved out of the familys house and into an apartment downtown found a different job and joined a climbing gym PERIOD From this point on things really turned around for me and I found a way to make myself happy and my lifestyle work. worth taking the risk

A twoyear trip abroad is something that few people take the risk to experience it also entails things that many may not have the means to complete PERIOD For example a plane ticket might be too expensive or going abroad may not interest some individuals PERIOD However Lovelace said she believes that alternative risky and unique experiences prove to be extremely valuable to an individuals life PERIOD

I really believe just taking a risk and doing something youve never done before can teach you lifechanging lessons and it doesnt have to include an expensive international plane ticket Lovelace said PERIOD

Overall Lovelaces experience abroad not only helped her discover her identity but it made her stand out against her competitors when the time came for her to move onto the next chapter of her life back in the US PERIOD If you arent ready to jump straight into a job or even feel that you dont have enough life experience to start off in the workforce take a risk PERIOD Whether you go abroad or not taking a chance has the potential to not only make you a better version of yourself after graduation but it also sets up an incredible adventure after college PERIOD
