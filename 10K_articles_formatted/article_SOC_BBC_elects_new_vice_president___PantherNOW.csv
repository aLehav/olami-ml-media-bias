Didier DJ Georges was elected by student club representatives as the new vice president for the Student Organizations Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

The special election was held after the resignation of Carla St PERIOD Louis the former SOCBBC vice president PERIOD She resigned three weeks before the Fall semester began after accepting an internship from The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars in Washington D.C PERIOD

The new vice president should be just a person whos dedicated wants change for the University  and who has patience PERIOD They should be prepared to make mistakes St PERIOD Louis said PERIOD They should come into SOC with an open mind and be prepared to work with the people. the election was pushed back until the second week of the Fall semester because SOCBBC wanted to be fair to the clubs that were not active during the summer PERIOD The organization also felt it was best to wait until after the first week of the semester according to Ivy Siegel the advisor for SOC and coordinator for the Department of Campus Life and Orientation PERIOD

Though clubs were informed of the election through emails SOCBBC knew that not all of the  clubs would be able to send representatives to the election said Joseph Joe Mintz SOCBBC president PERIOD

During the meeting the four candidates running for vice president were given two minutes to present themselves and their ideas before the club representatives PERIOD They were Danai Cheretis Jose Jay Flores Gabriel Labrador and Georges PERIOD

All the candidates had previous experience with SOCBBC Cheretis is the current marketing director for the organization Flores was SOCBBC treasurer last semester Labrador has participated in different SOCBBC clubs and Georges was a representative for the Catholic Student Association an organization under SOCBBC PERIOD

Mintz who was SOCBBCs vice president before becoming president said that the person who became vice president had to be able to take on the presidents responsibilities in the event that the president couldnt fulfill them PERIOD

The vice presidents main role is to serve as a personal assistant to the president and to fill in when he is not there Mintz said PERIOD The role of the vice president is probably the most undefined position PERIOD If you read our constitution its very vague on what the vice president has to do. during the election meeting Georges told the SOCBBC representatives why he was qualified for the position PERIOD

I spoke a lot about school spirit and how I want to bring school spirit here at the Biscayne Bay Campus and Im a guy who leads by example PERIOD I was Roary the Panther for the thirtieth anniversary birthday bash of BBC on June  said Georges a sophomore in an email to The Beacon PERIOD

The club representatives discussed each candidates strengths and weaknesses PERIOD

The candidates availability was one of the biggest concerns PERIOD

Several club members brought up the fact that Labradors other responsibilities within BBCs Student Government Council and Student Programming Council would not allow him to do the job effectively PERIOD

The student representatives liked Georges intention to help the clubs with whatever they need PERIOD

He seems like a very genuine guy PERIOD Hes willing to put himself out there to help any of us the SOC clubs if necessary  He seems like the one who is more willing to go out there and help us set up if we need to because he lives on campus and thats a plus said Nellista Reid SOCBBC representative for the Invitational Scholars Club PERIOD

Georges said he plans to meet with all the clubs and begin helping them motivate students to increase school spirit PERIOD

In his presentation Georges explained that school spirit at BBC was incredibly low PERIOD His proposed solution is support the different clubs in their endeavors by helping them obtain funding and ensuring that SOCBBC stands behind the clubs PERIOD

My plan now is to meet with the clubs PERIOD Each of the clubs gets to meet one on one with Joe but I want to be there and meet with them also and see the things they would like to do to attract more members and how I could help them do that Georges said PERIOD
