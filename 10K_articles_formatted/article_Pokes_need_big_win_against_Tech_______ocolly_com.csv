To call Saturdays regularseason finale against Texas Tech a big game for the Oklahoma State Cowboys would be an understatement PERIOD



A Cowboy win over the Red Raiders is crucial for OSU heading into next weeks Big  Tournament in Kansas City PERIOD



Despite keeping its NCAA Tournament hopes alive an OSU win coupled with a Missouri loss at Texas would catapult the Cowboys into the top four in the conference PERIOD



That would secure a firstround bye in Kansas City for the Pokes PERIOD



The battle with the Red Raiders also marks the final regularseason game in the storied career of OSU senior guard Adrian Peterson at GallagherIba Arena PERIOD



I cant dwell on that because were trying to get a win and get in the NCAA tournament Peterson said PERIOD



Itll be special but really I just want to win and get into the NCAAs. peterson the only senior on the Cowboy roster leads the Big  in scoring . and has been on a lateseason scoring frenzy PERIOD



In the past six games Peterson has averaged . points PERIOD



For his efforts Peterson was named Big 12s Player of the Week on Monday marking the second time he has captured the honor this season PERIOD



Peterson said even though the Red Raiders dont have much to play for the game will be a tough matchup PERIOD



You dont know how theyll react Peterson said PERIOD I dont think theyll throw in the towel though PERIOD



Coach James Dickey will probably pump them up and have them ready to play. against Tech the Cowboys are likely to be without a key starter PERIOD



Junior guard Joe Adkins sprained his ankle Monday against Kansas and hasnt practiced since PERIOD



Adkins who averages . points per game and netted  at KU is listed as doubtful against the Red Raiders PERIOD



The loss of Adkins will be especially significant on the defensive end of the floor PERIOD



Adkins would likely have drawn the defensive assignment of Tech point guard and leading scorer Rayford Young PERIOD



Young is averaging . points per game on the season and was named Big  Player of the Week two weeks ago after dropping a careerhigh  points in an upset win over Kansas PERIOD



Without Joe its going to present some matchup problems with Rayford Young Peterson said PERIOD Hes very quick and a good shooter PERIOD



I might have to guard him well just have to see. the Cowboys will also have to contend with doubledigit scorers Stan Bonewitz and Cliff Owens PERIOD



Bonewitz a senior guard is averaging  points per outing PERIOD



Owens a 6foot8 junior is averaging . points and also leads Tech in rebounding at  per game PERIOD



Guard Glendon Alexander will likely earn the starting nod if Adkins is unable to play PERIOD



Alexander is averaging . points and has been hot of late PERIOD



The junior transfer netted  points last week against Mizzou including connecting on 4of7 threepoint attempts PERIOD



Others will have to step up Peterson said PERIOD



Guys like Glendon Alexander and Brian Montonati they need to keep playing well with Joe on the bench. earlier in the season the Cowboys cruised to a  triumph over the Red Raiders in Lubbock Texas PERIOD



In that game Peterson and Desmond Mason combined for  points PERIOD



The Cowboys shot a blistering  percent in the second half and ended the game on a  run to pull away from Tech in Lubbock PERIOD



OSU has won fiveofseven career meetings against Tech in Stillwater PERIOD



Saturdays tipoff is set for  p.m PERIOD
