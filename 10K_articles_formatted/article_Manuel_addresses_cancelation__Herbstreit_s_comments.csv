In lieu of a press conference  which would have been his first time taking questions from reporters since over June  Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel released a fourminute QA with the athletic departments inhouse reporter to address the cancelation of Saturdays game at Maryland PERIOD

Manuel stressed that the decision came down to keeping everybody safe and was made on the advice of medical professionals PERIOD

We are going to always move in a direction that our medical professionals believe we should Manuel said PERIOD We are in the middle of a pandemic PERIOD It is the highest case count in almost every state and in our nation PERIOD I am proud of what our student athletes what they had done and our coaches to get us this far PERIOD But as one of my colleagues texted me after this announcement COVID is undefeated as it relates to this. asked about the status of next weeks Ohio State game Mauel didnt give a direct answer only saying that Michigan was still waiting on todays test results to come back and hopes to play PERIOD

In the limited public comments Michigan has made on the situation no one has addressed how many cases of COVID19 have been found on the football team how many players may be out due to contact tracing or whether the Big Tens positivity rate thresholds for shutting down have been reached PERIOD

In a similar video to Manuels medical director Sami Rifat didnt give specific numbers saying only it really goes beyond that because we also look at sort of the trends PERIOD Are we starting to see a spike in activity and where is that going Its hard to give you one number because its very situational. associate athletic director Darryl Conway speaking in the same format added Theres really no specific number overall PERIOD We look at each team individually and examine the Big Ten the established Big Ten thresholds that the conference has established for each sport based on your Tier  congregate group. michigans athletic department has in fact sent media departmentwide versions of those numbers weekly since bringing athletes back to campus in June PERIOD

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh gave a 19minute press conference on Monday in which he deflected most questions PERIOD The program canceled its regular availability with players and assistant coaches PERIOD Manuel has not been made available to independent reporters PERIOD

The program said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that the earliest it could begin practicing was next Monday Dec PERIOD   a week after initially shutting down PERIOD

I like to see a good  days of us trending in the right direction before we feel comfortable getting people back together Rifat said PERIOD

Saturdays cancelation means that for the first time ever Michigan will have a winless season at home PERIOD

I talked to Jim Harbaugh earlier and he was really disappointed by the decision  understands the decision supports the decision Manuel said PERIOD But we want to play PERIOD Those studentathletes want to play PERIOD This was an opportunity that we have to pause and we all understand it PERIOD But they are disappointed. manuel also addressed Kirk Herbstreits comments on ESPNs College Football Playoff rankings show Tuesday night PERIOD Herbstreit said he thought Michigan waves the white flag and potentially avoids playing Ohio State next week insinuating that the rivalry game would be canceled because the  Wolverines wouldnt want to play PERIOD

Ohio State must play both of its remaining games to stay eligible for the Big Ten championship unless the conference changes the rules PERIOD Herbstreit later released a video apologizing PERIOD

Conway said he was bound from sharing false information by his medical license and thus any insinuation of gamesmanship was unfounded PERIOD

I think its ridiculous Manuel said PERIOD I have to pause because my words the anger I was infuriated by the insinuation that Michigan would do anything other than play a football game PERIOD Weve been playing this game since  PERIOD Were the winningest program for a reason because we play whoevers in front of us PERIOD The only way we want to keep anybody from moving on is to beat them on the field as a player PERIOD

To insinuate that to say something other than that is a statement by a fool PERIOD It is something I cant tell you how embarrassed I am for the Big Ten conference to have one of their representatives who played this game to say that about any team in this conference PERIOD And to say it about college football and the studentathletes around this country who are trying to play games during a pandemic it is ridiculous and sad. clarification This story has been updated to indicate that Conways comments regarding his medical license were in reference to Kirk Herbstreits comments on ESPN not Michigans lack of sharing positivity numbers PERIOD
