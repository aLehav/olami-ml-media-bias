2184,2022-03-16,"this weekend the  mens soccer team will head east to take on Case Western Reserve and Carnegie Mellon PERIOD The No PERIOD  Maroons are looking to continue their fantastic season and extend their winning streak against the  Spartans and the  No PERIOD  Tartans PERIOD

Chicago is coming off of last weekends  senior day victory against Aurora in which it tied records for both winsand shutouts in a season PERIOD Two Maroons thirdyear defender Stacey Reimann and fourthyear forward and captain Brenton Desai were named UAA Athletes of the Week in the wake of this performance PERIOD The indomitable UChicago defense has only allowed five goals in  games and it is complemented by an explosive offense that has scored  goals in just the last five games PERIOD Reimann attributes the Maroons success up and down the field to the depth they have at every position PERIOD Across games no matter the strength of the opponent we are able to play several different players at a single position PERIOD Starters are getting enough rest while substitutes are getting significant playing time PERIOD And as a result we are healthier stronger and more prepared to outwork our opponent. the Maroons will look to exercise this depth against Case Western Reserve on Friday PERIOD The Spartans have gone into overtime against their last three UAA opponents resulting in a disappointing two ties and a loss PERIOD They are undoubtedly mentally and physically drained but are likely to come out looking for redemption PERIOD However the Spartans inability to close out matches and find gamewinning goals could prove deadly against a Maroons team that has shown its ability to take a lead and hold onto it as well as its capacity to come back from a deficit PERIOD

A victory on Friday would put the Maroons in a position to clinch the UAA title in their penultimate regularseason game on Sunday PERIOD The Tartans have only one victory in UAA play despite dominating performances against regional opponents PERIOD Desai is excited about the opportunity that the weekend presents saying that the team will be very focused on continuing to play hard and keeping our level as high as it can be PERIOD UAA games are always a battle so its going to be important that we are composed and humble

Although Chicago is undefeated and holds the top spot in the country fourthyear captain DJ Weis also emphasizes the importance of taking nothing for granted PERIOD Our team only ever takes one game at a time PERIOD The goal of our team is always to win the next game and improve ourselves in the process PERIOD We have two opportunities this weekend to make ourselves better. going into the weekend Weis and the rest of the Maroons are motivated by the belief that if we come out aware of the game plan and our past mistakes and play our best then theres no opposition we cant beat. the Maroons will face Case Western Reserve in Cleveland before travelling to Pittsburgh to face Carnegie Mellon PERIOD Kickoffs are scheduled for  p.m PERIOD on Friday and  p.m PERIOD on Sunday respectively PERIOD
