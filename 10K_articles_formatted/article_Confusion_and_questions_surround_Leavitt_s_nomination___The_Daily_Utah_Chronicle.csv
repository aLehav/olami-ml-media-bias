407,2023-10-23,"on Aug PERIOD  President Bush announced his nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency Utah Gov PERIOD Mike Leavitt PERIOD 
I came home that day flipped on the TV and proceeded to be confused PERIOD Thats how a lot of us feel I think PERIOD 
Since President Bushs nomination was announced theres been a lot of discussion on whether or not Mike Leavitt is actually a friend to the environment a pawn in some grand scheme of the White House or the best friend of big business PERIOD 
In the press conference last month Gov PERIOD Leavitt described his environmental philosophy using the Latin phrase enlibra. explained Leavitt It means to move toward balance PERIOD To me there is an inherent human responsibility to care for the earth. the Enlibra Doctrine is an approach to environmental stewardship adopted by the National Governors Association coauthored by Leavitt and then Gov PERIOD John Kitzhaber of Oregon PERIOD It is based on the concepts of balance and stewardship and built upon flexibility innovation partnership and collaboration PERIOD The philosophy emphasizes collaboration instead of polarization markets national standards and neighborhood solutions markets instead of mandates solutions that transcend political boundaries and other common sense ideas that will accelerate environmental progress. what that basically means is that Leavitt wants to put environmental decisions back in the hands of the people who will be most directly affected by those decisionsreducing the power of the federal government while increasing the power of the states local governments and tribal officials PERIOD
That sounds all well and good but it sort of contradicts the mission statement of the EPA PERIOD How will the EPA protect the interests of all Americans from risks to health and environment if its leader wants to let Orange County decide this Oklahoma City decide that and Vermont decide something else entirely How will the EPA play a leadership role to other nations in protecting the environment if the philosophy of the EPAs leader is let them work it out themselves
Its one thing to involve all parts of society in managing the environment but quite another to let the mayor of Kaysville to cut a deal with OPEC PERIOD
Of course Leavitt has done some great things for Utahs environment PERIOD Today Utah meets all federal airquality standards has the nations cleanest watersheds and  percent of our streams meet federal water quality standards an improvement from about  percent  years ago PERIOD
Leavitt helped to protect  acres of state lands and helped establish Utahs Quality Growth Commission PERIOD He also worked tirelessly to stop the storage of highlevel nuclear waste on Goshute Reservation lands PERIOD And that story he told about the Grand Canyon during the press conferencethat was a real tearjerker PERIOD However hes also been accused of cutting secret deals with Interior Department Secretary Gale Norton that will leave millions of acres of pristine lands open to mining drilling road building and other development. additionally his ability to release information that could prove damaging to the interests of industry has been called into question by Mark Van Putten president of the National Wildlife Federation PERIOD Van Putten expressed his concern over the nomination saying the President has nominated Gov PERIOD Leavitt to head the EPA at a time when the agencys credibility has been put into question over suppression of scientific and economic findingsthe centerpiece of the hearings on this nomination must be Gov PERIOD Leavitts commitment to stand behind and fully disclose the research conducted by agency staff. like I saidconfusion PERIOD Maybe hes a treehugger maybe hes not PERIOD We probably arent going to be able to answer that question until hes had the job for a couple of years PERIOD
All in all I think that Leavitt could do a good job heading the EPA PERIOD I dont especially think his nomination was the best thing that could have happened to the environment but at least the EPA itself is in good hands PERIOD
