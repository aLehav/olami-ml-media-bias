8405,2023-11-05,"p PERIOD Riding with Steer Clear feels like traveling with some of Chaucers Canterbury pilgrims PERIOD Only instead of a knight a miller and a nun I find a Stairwell a lab partner and a freestyling band PERIOD

p PERIOD Steer Clear which provides transportation for students every Friday and Saturday night from  p.m PERIOD to  a.m. started its spring service Feb PERIOD  PERIOD Though most students view it as a service solely for the inebriated it is for anyone who needs a ride to or from campus PERIOD

p PERIOD Of course many of the passengers are under the influence of alcohol which makes for an interesting ride PERIOD The Steer Clear vehicle is equipped with plastic buckets which can be used and then mandatorily bought for  PERIOD When students arent so lucky as to make it into the colorful animal bucket they have to pay a  fine PERIOD

p PERIOD If they tell us well pull over and let them get back to nature Schoettler said PERIOD

p PERIOD Steer Clear staffs its van with a driver and a coordinator who are paid 8hour PERIOD  This is the first semester the program hasnt been run by volunteers PERIOD

p PERIOD Were more reliable now that theres a paid staff Schoettler said PERIOD

p PERIOD Will Sealy  Student Assembly undersecretary of health and safety for substance abuse became Steer Clears director this semester because Greek Life could no longer support the program due to liability issues PERIOD With funding from the SA and new employees the program plans to be more stable than in previous years PERIOD

p PERIOD To get a better idea of the service I went along for a ride PERIOD
 p.m PERIOD  My night began with a pickup of two sober girls from the Green Leafe who needed a ride to Millington Hall PERIOD

p PERIOD I have a biology lab I need to work on one girl said laughing PERIOD
 Were not just a drunk bus driver Alison Schoettler  said PERIOD

p PERIOD Were here to help anyone who needs a safe ride. soon after Steer Clears cell phone which rings with a jazzy rendition of The Beatles Love Me Do received a call for a pickup at the King and Queen Apartments on Scotland Street PERIOD There the van picked up two rather happy travelers on their way to the Midlands Apartments PERIOD

p PERIOD You guys are awesome one student said PERIOD Im so glad Steer Clears back because its really hard to get from on campus to off campus and Im glad I dont have to pass out on someones floor. nearly every rider expressed his gratitude for Steer Clears return PERIOD

p PERIOD  a.m PERIOD  Coordinating where to go next was tricky with the large number of callers PERIOD

p PERIOD Our goal is especially to get the people who are farthest away and get them to where they need to go because theyre the most likely to drive staff member Erica Smith  said PERIOD
Steer Clear went to Governors Square where it picked up three passengers on their way to the Units and the Ludwell Apartments PERIOD Before getting back to campus the van picked up  more people from a party on Lafayette Street PERIOD  Though the service doesnt seem have clear boundaries it travels as far as Steeple Chase and the Midlands PERIOD

p PERIOD With a much noisier crowd driver Sarah Will  had to yell over the group to ask where they were going PERIOD Were going to ravage the Delis one yelled PERIOD The group was loud but still polite while disembarking the van at the University Center with many expressing their thanks PERIOD

p PERIOD    Driving to Ludwell we picked up a student who was holding a red Solo cup in his hand PERIOD

p PERIOD No drinks in the van Will yelled PERIOD

p PERIOD As we passed two girls Smith yelled out of her window Hey do you want a ride Were Steer Clear. exchanging glances and shrugs the girls ran across Rolfe Road and hopped in the van PERIOD Throughout the night Steer Clear picked up student pedestrians always trying to fill every seat PERIOD

p PERIOD   Soon we were at the Bryan Complex picking up a group of seven that proved to be the nights highlight PERIOD Someone decided that he wanted to start singing PERIOD Then comments started I want to sing a song. lets all sing. lets sing The Boxer by Simon and Garfunkel. i was particularly moved by the groups hearty Row Row Row Your Boat. p PERIOD One student whose frequent bladder complaints started to annoy his friends yelled out Hey my tuition is paying for this ride so I should be able to make an ass of myself. the drivers exchanged a knowing smile one of the many that would follow as the night went on PERIOD
p PERIOD   During a flow of calmer students we stopped at the Hospitality House to pick up a married couple in formal attire PERIOD The wife a student at the school of education was especially grateful PERIOD

p PERIOD Its so sweet for them to spend their night doing this PERIOD Especially when cabs are so expensive. p PERIOD She and her husband also a student got off the van at Pocahontas Trail and walked home so as to not inconvenience the other passengers by forcing the van to go out of its way PERIOD

p PERIOD The other passengers who had waited almost half an hour for the van to get back to Governors Square began to sound like children on a road trip  Are we there yet I have to pee. the drivers reassured them home was close PERIOD

p PERIOD   Back at the apartment complex we ran into the beatboxers again PERIOD One boarded stating I do too have a badonkadonk. clearly the groups energy was still on the rise PERIOD Soon the improvisation and beats started up again flavored with cursing and crude humor PERIOD

p PERIOD I decided to call it a night so I asked Steer Clear for my own ride home PERIOD  Though I may have been off to bed Steer Clear still had  minutes of service and sure enough the happy notes of Love Me Do played on PERIOD
