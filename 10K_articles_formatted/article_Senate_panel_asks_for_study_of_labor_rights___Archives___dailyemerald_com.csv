7669,1970-01-01,"members of the University Senate ad hoc committee on trademark licensing in their final report to senate members called on the University administration Wednesday to establish a new institute or curricula to further study global human rights PERIOD

The committee had been studying issues surrounding labor monitoring and code of conduct issues since student protests led to the University establishing relations with both the Worker Rights Consortium and the Fair Labor Association PERIOD

But those membership ties were never formalized because of legal issues and a policy adopted in February by the State Board of Higher Education effectively killed any future University involvement with monitoring organizations PERIOD

Professor David Frank director of the Honors College and committee chairman said while the boards decision made most of the committees work irrelevant it was still able to conclude that the University should support greater research into human rights issues PERIOD

He said the one point all members of the committee agreed on was that the University should encourage the collaboration of research and education on human rights in the global economy PERIOD

We envision the creation of a center for the study of global rights Frank said PERIOD

Many senators supported the motion which was tabled to be voted on at the next meeting and also expressed their dismay and frustration at the state boards policy PERIOD

University President Dave Frohnmayer attended the senate meeting and said afterward that the administration wholeheartedly supports the intent of the ad hoc committees recommendation but said it was far too early to guess at the plans specifics PERIOD

We will embrace the spirit of the recommendation he said PERIOD

Frohnmayer also added that the boards policy doesnt do anything to stifle active debate on the issues surrounding labor and trademark licensing PERIOD

Adopted during the boards Feb PERIOD  meeting the policy requires all schools in the Oregon University System to conduct business in a straightforward and politically impartial manner making it illegal for Oregons universities to become full members of monitoring groups such as the WRC and FLA PERIOD

Greg McLauchlan an associate professor of sociology said it was a sad day in higher education when a university is required to step back from organizations that he said offer some of the only truly accurate accounts of human rights abuses in international factories PERIOD He said it should be every universitys mission to rely on unbiased sources of information for intellectual discussion and that the boards policy prevents that flow of ideas PERIOD

Other senators said the policy defeated the spirit of student activism that helped keep the issue of human rights abuse on the campus agenda PERIOD

The net effect of how the story unfolded is negative said Randall McGowen a history professor who also called the boards policy a legal smokescreen. he said faculty members should implement the ad hoc committees recommendation to ensure that the student movement does not become forgotten PERIOD

Margaret Hallock faculty director for the Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics said she remains optimistic about working on human rights issues despite the boards decision PERIOD

There is still much we can do under the Oregon University System policy she said PERIOD

By staying in touch with monitoring organizations and continuing to look at the various issues around human rights Hallock said the University will be able to maintain in active voice in the debate PERIOD

Other senators echoed opinion that the University need not take a defeatist or victimized stance PERIOD

Senators will vote on the committees report which was introduced as a motion at their next meeting in May PERIOD
