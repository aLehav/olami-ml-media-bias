I was appalled to read in Sierra Smiths article on Larry Wilmores new show ...Wilmore highlights political issues in the point of view of colored individuals. the term colored is fraught with historical meaning that demeans all black people PERIOD

It conjures up images of the south in the U.S PERIOD not that long ago where drinking fountains had signs over them saying For colored only. i am very troubled to see this used by a writer for the STAR and also not changed by the editors. a better term would be people of color or black individuals. laurel HolmstromKeyes Staff Member
