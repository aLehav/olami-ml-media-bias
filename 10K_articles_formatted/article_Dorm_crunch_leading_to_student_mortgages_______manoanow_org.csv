MIAMI  Freshman year for Emily Williams meant cramming her life
into a 14footby14foot dormitory room that came with its own
bathroom and alas two roommates trying to cram their lives into
the same space PERIOD

Sophomore year has brought Williams her own bedroom but also
another set of domestic drawbacks termites cement contractors and
mortgage payments PERIOD

To free her from the dorms Williams parents recently bought
her a house across the street from Barry University in Miami
Shores Fla PERIOD The mortgage is about  a month which Emily
shares with a housemate and a third student renting an attached
apartment PERIOD

The strategy amounts to a pricey but increasingly popular
response to the national campus housing crunch which has
offcampus rents commanding top dollar and schools like Barry
stashing students in hotels until dorm spaces open up PERIOD

Meanwhile low interest rates are convincing more parents it
makes sense to pay both tuition and a mortgage to put a child
through school PERIOD

 in offcampus
purchases said Lua Hancock director of residential life and
housing for Nova Southeastern University in Davie Fla PERIOD 

Emilys father David Williams said her share of the mortgage
costs less than what Barry charged for a dorm room PERIOD The
selfemployed fence contractor in Kentucky is hoping to break even
with the extra expenses that come with offcampus living like a
car once graduation day arrives and he sells the property for a
profit PERIOD


Williams said in a telephone interview from Lexington PERIOD 

Students who expected to dorm at the University of Hawaii at
Manoa this fall semester also were affected by an increase in
students seeking to live oncampus PERIOD An increase in enrollment this
semester caused student housing applications to surge leaving some
 UH students stuck on the dormitory waiting list PERIOD

To alleviate overcrowding UH made use of the Affiliated Student
Housing ASH program which provides students with hotel rooms as
housing PERIOD

ASH debuted last year when the Continental SurfKuhio Village
Resort accommodated  students PERIOD After receiving positive feedback
UH decided to continue with the program this year PERIOD

UH also has plans to renovate a residence hall located east of
Gateway on Dole Street that expects to add  more bedrooms PERIOD
Another plan to increase student housing is to build a new
residence near the parking area of Varsity Theater which plans to
bring  bedrooms PERIOD

Owning offcampus housing eliminates many of the hassles
associated with college living while creating some of its own PERIOD

Students arent forced to move out every spring and move in
every fall though summer breaks can mean the loss of roommates and
rental revenue PERIOD

The space is almost always roomier than in a dormitory but
administrators say offcampus students tend to feel less connected
to their school and miss out on extracurricular activities PERIOD

And students reveling in collegeage independence find
themselves once again living under Mom and Dads roof even if it
is hundreds of miles from home PERIOD

 said
Debbie Preston a Miami Beach Fla. real estate broker who
recently joined her exhusband in buying a Gainesville Fla. house
for their two sons at the University of Florida PERIOD 

Party worries aside  the Prestons picked a house with a hot tub
for Marc and Ryan  its the aversion to throwing rent money away
that prompts most families to purchase real estate for their
collegeage children PERIOD

 said real estate agent Dolores Longo who
specializes in selling units at the University Inn condominium
complex near the University of Miami PERIOD 

And offcampus ownership isnt necessarily a financial
nobrainer even for families who have the extra cash for a down
payment PERIOD

Investment strategies dont always mesh with academic calendars
warns accountant Esther Superstein PERIOD It can take several years to
cover the transaction costs associated with purchasing real estate
 even with the booming real estate market of the last several
years PERIOD

 Superstein said PERIOD

A real estate downturn could leave parents faced with either
selling their childs college digs or trying to rent and manage it
from several states away PERIOD

 said David Williams of his
daughters house near Barry PERIOD 

He said he isnt worried about his daughter a 19yearold
scholarship student who works on campus and at the Macaroni Grill
to help cover her school expenses PERIOD Shes serving as landlord for
the property collecting rent checks from the other two residents
of the modest bungalow PERIOD Shes responsible for upkeep which her
father pays for PERIOD

 said Emily who just started
finance classes for her international business major PERIOD 

But if a place of her own has brought new headaches Emily says
she loves the privacy space and her two favorite offcampus
amenities her kitten Frank and her dog Clyde PERIOD

 she said PERIOD
