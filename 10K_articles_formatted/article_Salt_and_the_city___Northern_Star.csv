By  Libby JohnApril  

Just because salt didnt pepper DeKalbs roads this winter doesnt necessarily mean money saved for future snowfalls PERIOD

During a normal winter the average snowfall is between  and  inches and an average of  tons of salt are used by the city PERIOD This winter has seen  inches of snow and  tons of salt have been used so far said John Conlin assistant public works director for DeKalb PERIOD

Even though nine tons less were used this year the city hasnt saved any money yet PERIOD Conlin said the city put in a bid to purchase a certain amount of salt this winter and it still has  tons to receive PERIOD

The storage for the salt is already too full so the salt will be stored with the salt supplier for  per ton PERIOD And whether or not DeKalb will save money on salt depends on how much the salt will cost next year PERIOD

This year the salt cost . per ton and if the price goes up next winter the city will have saved money because of its salt surplus PERIOD

Its a bit of a gamble Conlin said PERIOD Its a nice problem to have. last winter the NIU Grounds crew paid almost twice as much for salt at a price of  per ton said Tom Anderson NIUs superintendent of grounds PERIOD

DeKalb and the grounds crew did save money from lack of overtime PERIOD NIU Grounds paid about  hours less in overtime than a usual winter which saved about  PERIOD

Also this year snow plows and trucks went out only two dozen times for the city and some trips were of short duration Conlin said PERIOD

In a normal winter the vehicles are out about  to  times PERIOD Conlin added last year the trucks were out almost every day in December but this December the trucks werent out at all PERIOD

Even if money was saved the department wont get to use the savings to get equipment or other snowrelated supplies PERIOD

We dont get money in amount Conlin said PERIOD As we spend money we go into the general revenue funds. it can be thought of as a doubleended sword Conlin said PERIOD If it was a really bad winter we might have to sell a truck. though the crews werent out moving a lot of snow more grounds work was done during that time than normal PERIOD

January and February were spent street sweeping and removing  to  trees PERIOD Grounds also performed a lot of forestry and electrical work PERIOD
