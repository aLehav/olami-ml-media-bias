4027,2023-11-03,"the Fresno State baseball team pulled away in a fifthinning explosion as they downed Air Force  for a sweep of the Falcons in the final game of the weekend series Sunday afternoon at Pete Beiden Field PERIOD

The Dogs opened the game strong with threestraight hits from the top of the batting order culminating with the first scored run of the game coming from junior outfielder Jake Stone who was happy about the series sweep PERIOD

It feels awesome to get a sweep against them because they were the top team and they have a lot of great players Stone said PERIOD Its real awesome knowing that we can take three from one of the best teams in the conference. the Bulldogs also capitalized with great defense and with great command and poise on the mound from freshman pitcher Edgar Gonzalez PERIOD

As the lead stretched Gonzalez was noticeably more comfortable on the mound throwing more strikes PERIOD

I knew that it wasnt going to be easy Gonzalez said PERIOD They were going to come in and battle but since I knew my team was going to have my back I just went in there and put in work I just threw strikes and worked on all my areas I had to throw in and just continued to pound the zone. the Falcons answered back in the third inning with their one and only score of the match after a Bulldogs error by junior outfielder Russell Williams evened the score at  PERIOD

In the bottom of the fifth inning the onslaught began as sophomore catcher Nick Warren hit a laser down the rightfield line to advance junior infielder Scott Silva to third base which allowed junior infielder Jesse Medrano to score and break the tie  PERIOD

But it didnt end there junior infielder Ryan Dobson hit a sacrifice fly bunt which allowed Silva to score and at the very next atbat junior outfielder Jake Stone crushed a triple to centerfield to drive in Warren which extended the lead to  PERIOD

After a pitching change by Air Force the Bulldogs managed to score once more in the bottom of the seventh inning when senior outfielder Brody Russell doubled to left field to drive in freshman outfielder Zach Ashford to close the deal  and extend their record to  at home PERIOD

Bulldogs head coach Mike Batesole believes the teams combination of small ball and good pitching is what helped them but he knows pitching was the story of this series PERIOD

I dont think there is any doubt Batesole said PERIOD Those are some fantastic hitters over there In that dugout and we held them in check enough to get three wins so pitching and defense both came through and thats what weve been all year. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
