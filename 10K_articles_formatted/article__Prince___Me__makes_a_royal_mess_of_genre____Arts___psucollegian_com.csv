You should all know the teen romantic comedy formula by now PERIOD

The earnest diligent girl from a Wisconsin farm in this case is repulsed by the crass selfish rich guy the Prince of Denmark here until she sees his sensitive side PERIOD Then they develop a strong romantic bond and enjoy tender offscreen lovemaking PERIOD

Inevitably at some point she finds out the  and yells at him about it and then later for some contrived reason or other they hook back up PERIOD

The Prince  Me certainly tries to hit all these beats but amazingly is too dumb to even fit comfortably within the prescribed formula PERIOD

For instance there is indeed a scene in which the farm girl played by Julia Stiles .. PERIOD so Middle America right yells at the Prince for deceiving her but the problem is he never actually did anything hurtful PERIOD Sure he withheld that he was a prince but that deception had nothing to do with their romance PERIOD He won her over by sheer charm PERIOD

So why was she so pissed We never find out and nobody in the movie seems to care PERIOD The dramatically unmotivated scene was merely a perfunctory genre convention the screenwriters must have realized at the last moment they simply couldnt live without whether it made sense in the narrative or not PERIOD

This is why while watching The Prince  Me  I couldnt help but feel bad for it PERIOD It was so confused and selfconscious like the little  year old who tries so hard to fit in with her older sisters friends PERIOD

Even weighed against the field of other teen romantic comedies Prince is conspicuously unappealing PERIOD

It needs to leave the mascara alone stay home and watch Teletubbies  PERIOD
