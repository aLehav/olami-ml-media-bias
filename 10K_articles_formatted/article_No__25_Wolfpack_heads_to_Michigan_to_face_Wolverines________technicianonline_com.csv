 coach Mark Stevenson said PERIOD For us to get to that would mean that we would be seeded to regionals so we would only have two other teams in the top  in our regional instead of having possible four other teams from the top .I think that knowing we are top  makes us want to push harder and do better because we want that top  spot we want that top  we want to make it to nationalsIt is definitely possible as long as we keep working hard and keep the right mentality.We have a very young team and a lot of the freshmen havent traveled yet so it will be there first opportunityAlso we are flying all day Thursday it is just something that is different PERIOD A lot of excitement comes from traveling and you learn how to use it to your advantage.Even though we are competing against Michigan theyre really not the people we have to compete against PERIOD In football you have to stay at home and take care of your gap or in basketball you have to play your man and not get lost in the crowd PERIOD Well for us its about doing what we do

We focus on our routines and making sure we are confident in what we were doing PERIOD We go out and do our routines to the best of our ability and Michigan goes out and does theirs to the best of their ability and the team with the higher score is going to win PERIOD If we do ours more consistently than they do we have a chance to win.We are going to do great PERIOD We have a really young team so it is hard but we have the potential to do well this weekendWe have a great support system  everybody is here for everybody PERIOD The seniors have been through this for four years and they know exactly what needs to be done and they make sure to relay that to us so that we are not hit with shock. log In
