Attendees and speakers mingled around tables full of snacks baked goods and lemonade set up by SOGIE members PERIOD

JMUs Office of Sexual Orientation Gender Identity and Expression SOGIE invited students to participate in an open mic night Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The event was hosted for LGBTQ members to share their coming out stories or creative works PERIOD

This event followed National Coming Out Day on Oct PERIOD  and it was SOGIEs fourth annual Coming Out Monologues event PERIOD

Attendees and speakers mingled around tables full of snacks baked goods and lemonade set up by SOGIE members PERIOD Kaitlyn Cline a social work major who also serves as the educational coordinator for SOGIE greeted guests next to a poster board that provided details about the organization and what it stands for as well as more information about the event itself PERIOD

Cline said she wishes JMU would do more to support and showcase SOGIE but that volunteers work hard to network and spread the organizations name and message PERIOD Cline said the turnout was much smaller than she was expecting with around  attendees in the audience PERIOD

I feel like JMU is maybe not the most welcoming campus for its queer students Cline said PERIOD Its nice to have a safe space when JMU doesnt provide one PERIOD Its a little disappointing when you see that there is no one or not a huge turnout. lynn Vassar a sophomore psychology major whos a peer educator for SOGIE was in charge of executing the event PERIOD Vassar encouraged attendees to sign up at Clines table if they wanted to speak as the night progressed PERIOD

Despite a smaller turnout many speakers told their stories on stage PERIOD They ranged from happy stories of parents and friends accepting of LGBTQ individuals coming out to awkward recounts of parents not quite understanding the nature of LGBTQ identities but still being supportive and sorrowful retellings of parents rejecting their true selves PERIOD

Charlotte Terrill a sophomore psychology major working with SOGIE as a peer educator said she originally didnt plan on sharing her story about her coming to terms with her asexuality PERIOD

Its such an interesting experience to be able to talk to so many people who want to listen to your story especially after a lot of times in your life when youre not able to Terrill said PERIOD

Vassar said its important that people feel comfortable enough to come out but that JMU hasnt done a good job at establishing programs to create an inclusive campus PERIOD

Something I do hope JMU does is restart inclusivity training Vassar said PERIOD I know it was canceled over the summer and completely halted for the time being. the inclusion training was given to student staff members but after concerns from the community the university paused the training PERIOD Tim Miller vice president for student affairs explained JMUs rationale in a video message addressed to the university community PERIOD

Vassar said SOGIE still does peer education but its not on a large scale like the inclusivity training wouldve been PERIOD

Terrill said she was disappointed with JMU because it rescinded and apologized for a social justice training SOGIE put out PERIOD She said she felt the training was a big step in the right direction to be able to talk about privilege the queer community critical race theory and other social issues PERIOD

MaryHope Vass director of communications and university spokesperson said in an email that SOGIE has an advisory board made up of faculty staff and administrators working to create more welcoming spaces for LGBTQindividuals PERIOD

SOGIE continues to provide programs resources workshopstrainings and services for LGBTQ students Vass said PERIOD It is through these events that we work to create open and inclusive conversations to provide support but to also receive feedback on areas for the university to continue its work. the night ended with many cheers for the speakers and those who worked to put on the event PERIOD Vassar reminded the audience that the Lavender Room located in the Student Success Center room  is a safe and comforting place to meet others in the LGBTQ community PERIOD

Vassars closing remark was to say they wish to create a secure environment for individuals to feel truly comfortable in their identities and sexuality PERIOD

Homophobia thrives in ignorance and silence Terrill said PERIOD
