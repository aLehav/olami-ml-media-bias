Though students are scattered across the globe as classes move online for the semester the University of Michigan Central Student Government will still hold elections online this Wednesday and Thursday March  PERIOD Here is what you need to know PERIOD

What am I voting on

Students are electing representatives for their schools to the Central Student Government Assembly PERIOD There is also a Universitywide election for the executive ticket of Central Student Government the Michigan Police Department Oversight Committee and the adoption of an instant runoff voting policy PERIOD These positions are all yearlong terms PERIOD Depending on the school there may also be specific proposals or policies for students to vote on PERIOD

Who is eligible to vote

For the executive ticket of CSG any student regardless of grade or school is eligible to vote PERIOD There are also elections for CSG Assembly representatives within each school at the University and any student can vote for their respective schools representative PERIOD

How and when can I vote

Voting begins on Wednesday March  at midnight and closes on Thursday March  at  p.m PERIOD All voting takes place online at vote.umich.edu PERIOD

Why do some schools have more openings than others

Each school is allotted a certain number of representatives based on the total number of students at the University enrolled in each school PERIOD LSA the largest school at the University has  representatives while smaller schools like the School of Education have as few as one seat PERIOD

Does how I rank the candidates matter

Yes PERIOD In student government elections a form of rankedchoice voting is used PERIOD This means students rank their preferences for the position with the option to rank as many candidates as there are open positions PERIOD So for the CSG executive ticket there is only one spot to rank because only one pair can hold the office while for representative elections with multiple seats voters can rank multiple candidates for those seats PERIOD

For the smaller schools this has little impact PERIOD However when there is more than one seat open like for LSAs  a different numerical value is given to each candidate based on how high they are ranked PERIOD That means a candidate who is ranked as a voters first choice receives more points from that voter than the candidate ranked as their second choice PERIOD

The voting frequently asked questions webpage offers this example If there are three open seats a vote for the No PERIOD  preference would give that candidate three points the No PERIOD  selection would receive two points and No PERIOD  would receive one point PERIOD

What is the difference between CSG and schoolwide student governments

CSG is the student government of the entire University student body containing representation from every school including graduate programs PERIOD CSG is known for its AirBus program offering free rides to and from the airport its game day hydration stations and for providing funding to student organizations PERIOD

Individual schools student governments are composed of students in programs within those schools PERIOD These student governments are typically more focused on the needs of students within their schools and drafting policies meant to specifically impact their respective school PERIOD

Can I writein candidates

Yes PERIOD There are options on every ballot to writein candidates PERIOD

What are these parties Im hearing about

Within individual schools governments presidential and vice presidential candidates will run together PERIOD However they are not involved in any parties and all candidates for these governments run independently PERIOD

For CSG parties sometimes led by a presidential and vicepresidential candidate endorse a slate of candidates running for seats in the Assembly PERIOD This year one party called Represent Michigan is not putting up candidates for the executive ticket election PERIOD The other two parties Mobilize Michigan and Change At Michigan have presidential and vice presidential candidates as well as endorsed candidates running for Assembly seats PERIOD Additionally two groups are running for LSA Student Government PERIOD

No party in this years election has a full slate of Assembly candidates PERIOD A full slate would mean there is exactly the same number of candidates endorsed by the party as there are open positions  so for LSAs  spots a party would have  candidates to have a full slate and this would be the same across all schools PERIOD This means that while it is possible for a party to win a plurality of seats in the Assembly it is likely more that one or all parties in this election will have at least some representation within the Assembly PERIOD

Where can I get more information to make an informed decision

You can learn more about the candidates parties and platforms in The Dailys election guide PERIOD
