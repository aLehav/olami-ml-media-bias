1745,2023-10-30,"with a soft acoustic smooth vocals and brandishing the unmistakeable sound quality of an old dusty tape recorderAndy Ferros debut album Muirhead could easily pass forlong lost Lennon cuts PERIOD Ferro Londonborn and Nashvillebred uses folk and psych vibesto recall familiar sounds of the 1950s and 60s mixing them all up into his own sound PERIOD
Though Muirheadis just  songs this EP is the perfect breakout record for Ferro as it showcases his talents with a myriad of different embellishments that bring the whole album around into a familiaryet invigoratingly fresh sound PERIOD And all this is accomplished through the use of an old tape machine no recording studio no thousand button mixing boards just a man a guitar and occasionally a keyboard PERIOD To give a sense of just how down to earth this EP truly is the album closes out with a little screwup on the opening chords of Useless Powderand a faint shit uttered by Ferro himself PERIOD
The opening track Sugar and Milk however kicks off the way its meant to with a lilting chord progression and a heavy Link Wrayesque and St PERIOD Pepper style George Harrison guitarlick thatweave themselves through the song PERIOD Similarly Hood the third single of the EP featuresavibrant electric picking PERIOD
With a few synthlike contributions by Mitch Jones the psychedelic spirit of prominent 60s rock icons like Syd Barrett shines through on tracks like Plane Clothes Crystal Tongue and Pendulum Song. but even with the psychedelic vibes and the occasionally chunky squealing guitarsthe entire album with its melodic chord progressions and catchy vocals is soft and reminiscent of 1950s icon Buddy Holly  in reality it seems like the perfect backing tracks to a heartwarming indie film PERIOD
Muirheadwill be released on February  via Rough Beast Records PERIOD
