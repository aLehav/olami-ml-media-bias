At the entrance of Crossroads Mall stands a sign greeting UNO students faculty and staff and advertising promotions they can take advantage of if they just happen to be at the mall PERIOD 

The original posting welcoming the Omaha community into the mall is on the backside of this billboard PERIOD

This sign represents the significance of the UNO community for the mall PERIOD Thanks to the UNO shuttle system which now stops at Crossroads for those who park at the malls garage the number of students and faculty members shopping there has increased PERIOD 

Senior Jennifer Digman a graphic design major said parking at the mall is convenient for two reasons PERIOD She can easily find a parking spot and go shopping before or after class while shes there PERIOD

Digman said she has noticed many students who come out of the mall and catch the shuttle bus PERIOD  

With the guarantee of a shuttle having to be at the parking structure at all times and an average wait of only four minutes according to one shuttle driver the service seems to be working PERIOD 

For Digman and many other students it means saving time gas and money PERIOD

I like not having to come to school two hours early to find a parking spot she said PERIOD 

Digman said the shuttle is economical and that it is a service which students should take advantage of PERIOD

For a lot of students its expensive to afford a parking permit PERIOD The shuttle is more cost effective and a good use of our resources since were paying for it she said PERIOD 

Parking at Crossroads proves to be beneficial to the mall as well PERIOD 

More people will be tempted to go in and look around Digman said PERIOD  More students have the opportunity to just hop in and pick up something if they need to. melody Nelson an assistant manager of Gadzooks said she has seen an increase of students in the mall with the addition of the shuttle system PERIOD She thinks the accessibility of the shuttle is a good thing PERIOD 

Several stores including Gadzooks Finish Line and Old Navy offer discounts for UNO students PERIOD Their UNO ID also lets students take advantage of food court specials such as . tuesdays when food venders offer cheap meals PERIOD

Scott Hecox a manager at Finish Line said the parking arrangement has helped sales go up in his store PERIOD

It makes it easier Hecox said PERIOD It gives them an excuse PERIOD Theyre already in the mall why not come in and look 

Hecox said has even had a few students from UNO come by and apply for jobs PERIOD Hes not certain that the shuttle system is the exact reason why he has seen an increase in applications though PERIOD

With the holiday season approaching Hecox said he hopes to see more UNO students as part of the seasonal shopping crowd PERIOD  While businesses may benefit from students buying power during the holidays the students have the advantage of not having to walk through the cold to get to their cars PERIOD

Taylor Bendgen a sophomore business major said she has always been able to find parking at the mall and it has proved to be more convenient PERIOD

I like it Bendgen said PERIOD I think its better than the AkSarBen parking lots PERIOD I dont have to wait as long for the shuttles and it is going to be nice in the winter not to deal with the snow. at the entrance of Crossroads Mall stands a sign greeting UNO students faculty and staff and advertising promotions they can take advantage of if they just happen to be at the mall PERIOD
