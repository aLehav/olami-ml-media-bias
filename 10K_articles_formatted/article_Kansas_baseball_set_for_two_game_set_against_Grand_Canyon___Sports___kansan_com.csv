After a tworun loss to Boston College  to end the Snowbird Classic Kansas  heads to Arizona to take on the Grand Canyon Lopes  PERIOD

Earlier in the season Grand Canyon showed their ability to hit the ball well in a  drubbing of Bradley PERIOD The Lopes recorded  hits against the Braves PERIOD Behind senior second baseman Chad De La Guerra who had  RBIs Grand Canyon amassed  RBIs PERIOD

Last time out for the Lopes saw little success from the batters box PERIOD Grand Canyon only collected three runs on  hits through a two game series against the University of WisconsinMilwaukee PERIOD The Lopes allowed  runs over the two game series to UWMilwaukee PERIOD

As the Jayhawks head down to Phoenix there are a few things to keep your eyes peeled for PERIOD For the Jayhawks junior second baseman Colby Wright has found himself on base every game this season and is looking to extend his fourgame hitting streak PERIOD Additionally be on the lookout for how the Jayhawks pitching staff performs PERIOD If the pitchers can get two strong starting efforts against Grand Canyon there is no reason to think that Kansas wont leave Arizona without at least one win added to their season total PERIOD

For Grand Canyon De La Guerra was selected as the Western Athletic Conferences Player of the Year PERIOD He showed off his batting abilities against Bradley with nine RBIs and more recently against UWMilwaukee with a fourhit game including a home run PERIOD De La Guerra has been attacking the ball with ferocity this season so be sure to keep a look out when he steps in the batters box PERIOD

The games themselves can be viewed on a local news station out of Phoenix PERIOD The first game starts Tuesday at  p.m. and the second game of the series will be Wednesday at  p.m PERIOD
