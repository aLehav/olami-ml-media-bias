3725,2020-02-21,"the month of February always brings with it the highest level of Hockey East matchups PERIOD On Thursday night Boston College mens hockey opened up its homeandhome series against Northeastern setting the stage for a top10 matchup with playoff implications looming over both teams heads PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Eagles   Hockey East understood the opportunity they had to further separate themselves from their opponents in the final playoff race and they capitalized on it PERIOD BC took the ice sharing the conference throne with UMass at  pointsmaintaining the headtohead tiebreaker for postseason seedingwhile the No PERIOD  Huskies   trailed just three points behind PERIOD

The only thing tighter than the race for first might have been Thursday nights battle as a hardfought  victory that came right down to the wire gave BC the exact cushion that it was looking for PERIOD

The win marks BCs tenth 20win campaign in the past  years and fifteenth in the past  seasons PERIOD Renowned head coach Jerry York registered a 20win season for the twentieth occasion of his 26year BC career PERIOD

In a situation where the Eagles control their own destiny in closing out their season the first game of a double header against the Huskies was one of the toughest tests thus far PERIOD Northeastern kicked things off red hot having swept the sixty-eighth annual Beanpot and won five of its last six outings PERIOD

The Huskies were able to find the back of the net a mere two minutes into the opening frame PERIOD On just the second shot of the night Matt Filipe capitalized on a wraparound opportunity as he shoved the puck past Eagles goaltender Spencer Knight beating him under the pads PERIOD

The remainder of the period saw backandforth exchanges traded on both ends of the ice PERIOD With just around a minute left in the frame the Eagles tied things up thanks to a nifty Julius Mattila goal PERIOD After captain David Cotton slid a pass along the left wing Mattila juked to the left faceoff dot before wristing a low shot right through Huskies netminder Craig Pantanos fivehole PERIOD

The second period told a much different story than the first with the Eagles dominating all areas of the ice PERIOD Coupled by defensive physicality throughout the bulk of the frame BC outshot its opponent by an  margin PERIOD The Eagles had a plethora of chances in front of the net in a frame that seemingly should have ended with much more goalscoring early on PERIOD Nonetheless BC was able to find the back of the net twice through the likes of Marshall Warren and Julius Mattila PERIOD

Midway through the period Jack McBain sent a low shot on target that allowed Warren to tuck the loose puck just inside the left post PERIOD With the goal Warren became one of three rookie defensemen in Hockey East to find the back of the net at least five times PERIOD

Six minutes later Julius Mattila found his second tally of the night PERIOD During a twoonone rush Logan Hutsko slipped a crosscrease pass to Mattila from the right side allowing him to fire the puck right past Pantano PERIOD Hutsko continues to prove himself as a key playmaker integral to BCs recent success as his pair of assists in the victory marked the forty-ninth and fiftieth of his collegiate career PERIOD He stands at fourth in the nation in goals per game with  tallies through  contests having at least one point in all but three games this season PERIOD

That dominant secondperiod push from BC proved to become the crucial turning point in the game as the Huskies were only able to get one more past Knight before the final buzzer sounded at a  scoreboard in favor of BC PERIOD The final goal came in the opening half of the third frame after Jordan Harris low onetimer squeezed its way through Knights pads and just over the goal line PERIOD

Northeastern peppered Knight with shots from all areas of the ice before and after that tally requiring a strong presence in between the pipes from Knight until the very final seconds of the contest PERIOD And needless to say he did not disappoint PERIOD

A highlightreel kick save with nine minutes left in the final frame from a pointblank shot from Matt Demelis was just one of the many key stops that kept the Eagles lead alive PERIOD Knights 27save performance was enough to register his nineteenth win on the season and he finds himself sitting tenth nationally in both goals allowed per game . and save percentage . pERIOD
