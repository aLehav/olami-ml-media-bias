Perhaps there is no more appropriate repository of our collective conscious than YouTube.com.Building upon the success of its nowubiquitous search engine the Google Corporation has created a Web site where any human being that owns a computer can insert whatever  and I mean whatever  they want into the Internet for the rest of humanity to see PERIOD I would hazard to guess the vast majority of you have spent more than  minutes on YouTube so you know how indescribably staggering the resulting phenomenon is.YouTube because of the sheer volume of content that is dumped onto it daily manages to cram together what is great about humanity as well as the parts of humanity we wish we could ignore PERIOD Ive always thought that if aliens were trying to learn about our culture through YouTube they would probably be left scratching their round green heads.Now the fickle mother that is the Internet has given birth to a similar equally perplexing phenomenon GodTube.Its exactly what you think it is.The Web site describes itself as  Essentially its a YouTube focused on Christian matters.Although it is not nearly as popular extensive or wellknown as YouTube the Web site is equally as puzzling PERIOD The video content ranges from personal testimonies to recorded sermons and church services to videos of Christian music both traditional and contemporary to liturgical dancing and to a myriad of other videobased posts.Just like YouTube the meaningful is outrageously juxtaposed with the nonsensical. a powerful movie clip of C.S PERIOD Lewis played by Anthony Hopkins tackling the question of why God allows suffering sits three posts above an eightsecond clip of a random stranger singing  in front of a psychedelic background. a moving story of a soldiers battlefield conversion sits on the same page as a trailer for  which appears to be a lowbudget Just like YouTube the Web site has its gems of really good content PERIOD Also like YouTube you have to sift through a lot of insanity cheesiness and mindwrenching inanity to find it PERIOD Make ample use of the search feature or else youre going to find yourself watching faith dramas in Legos babies walking for the first time or Another commonality between God Tube and its more secular cousin is its attendant legion of Webzealots PERIOD God Tubes virtual personal crusaders are generally of the antiliberal antiMuslim antigay or antiabortion flavor PERIOD The videos these  make almost exclusively consist of baseless angry rhetoric and old tired mantras and slogans. if youre looking for a coherent rational prolife argument avoid God Tube at all costs.An interesting and unique feature of the Web site is an interactive  where visitors are free to leave personal prayers in a public space.The prayer wall contains posts that are eloquent and inspiring angry and disillusioned frantic and incoherent and selfish and glory seeking. in other words its a fascinating crosssection of a very grassroots prayer effort.If you are looking to explore the Christianity on an intellectual or philosophical level avoid this Web site at all costs PERIOD If you are considering converting to Christianity stay away PERIOD But if youre a Christian God Tube is definitely approachable in the same way YouTube is  if you are willing to sift through the mess you will be able to find things that will challenge and inspire you.Just avoid watching the baby videos PERIOD Youll never get that time back again. contact Matthew Albright at malbrightlsureveille.com
