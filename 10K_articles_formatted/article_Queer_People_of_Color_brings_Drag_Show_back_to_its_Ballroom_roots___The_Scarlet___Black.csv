It started off in chaos PERIOD Both dressing rooms were filled with makeupcovered counters clothes tossed everywhere hangers dangling on the doors PERIOD Performers taped back their breasts dusted glitter around their eyes and strapped their feet into platform heels PERIOD There were only minutes before it was time to perform PERIOD If someone had to go on stage before they were fully dressed they had to just go up PERIOD

Romeo Garcia also known as Caesar walked for Butch King as one of the Kings of QPOC PERIOD He is new to the drag scene and has been learning more about the culture in his tutorial this semester PERIOD This was his first time using KT tape which is what some Drag Kings use to help make their figures appear more masculine PERIOD He also did a full face to exaggerate more masculine features a skill he learned while doing color guard PERIOD

There were a wide range of performances PERIOD Some were meant to be laughed at some made people cry PERIOD Some were just gorgeous representations of queer people PERIOD The performance of Tucker Haddock  left the audience in silence until they received a standing ovation from nearly the entire crowd PERIOD I wanted to take a more serious perspective they said PERIOD



My performance was definitely about living with dysphoria and being a trans person and just living with my body Haddock said PERIOD When they went on stage they were dressed the same as the opening of the show PERIOD They didnt want to portray the opening performance as a different person from the character with dysphoria PERIOD A few lines into the song Haddock dropped their dress and showed scars painted onto their skin PERIOD It was raw and beautiful and they managed to steal the show PERIOD

Until Virgin Walk that is PERIOD Virgin Walk is when firsttime audience members come on stage PERIOD One little kid in attendance walked onto the stage in their princess costume and stole the hearts of audience members I was kind of surprised to see a little girl there performer Lizzi Kelly  said PERIOD

Performer Danielle Gillis  also known as Nat Kinkhole joined this semester as one of the dancers in Gender Revolution for Prince songs PERIOD She hadnt fully done drag makeup and outfits before so this time she wanted to go all the way PERIOD I got this image in my head that was probably semiPrince related. her group wanted to reject ideas of dress styles PERIOD Historically theres been different tensions about way you dress PERIOD Not even just historically but now too. their songs and dance were about being who you want and rejecting the genderbinary PERIOD

The finale was partially choreographed by Jason Rodriguez or Slim Xtravaganza a choreographer and actor from the TV show Pose that visited campus two weeks ago PERIOD Rodriguez taught a group of students how to vogue over a fourday period PERIOD The dancers on stage for this portion were a combination of QPOC and Dance Ensemble PERIOD
