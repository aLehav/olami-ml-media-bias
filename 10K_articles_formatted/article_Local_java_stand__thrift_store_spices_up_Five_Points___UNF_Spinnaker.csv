Penicillin ice cream cones and most importantly potato chips  all fantastic products that came into being by accident PERIOD Although the fruition of Five Points Coffee and Spice and the adjoining Uncommon Thrift Gallery wasnt exactly accidental it certainly wasnt planned PERIOD

Stuff happens Alva Richcreek Coffee and Spices owner said regarding his kismet acquisition PERIOD

After Heartworks Bakery closed a few years back Scribes Caf ran the space for about a year before selling it to Richcreek an act he had never really much considered before PERIOD However he had always wanted to run a little counter sandwich shop and the location of this place didnt suck  lying unassumingly just outside the sometimeraucous confines of the Riverside subneighborhood  and he was certainly armed with experience PERIOD

Ive been in and out of kitchens around the state since  Richcreek said PERIOD

Despite Richcreeks initially intimidating towerstance and burly build it becomes quickly apparent that the guy has got unarguable heart and dedication to the neighborhoods wellbeing PERIOD Plus he digs people PERIOD Even though Coffee and Spice which opened April this year has a full professional kitchen quietly tucked away behind the bustle of the front Richcreek instead opts for maximum customer interaction by plopping down an open kitchen behind a bar he built with his friend fellow employee and the inhouse DJ Brandon M. right by the glass window wall PERIOD

Alva has really built this place on favors and not even  Mandie Garrett Richcreeks girlfriend and fellow employee said PERIOD

She explained that the do it yourself aspect of the brickwalled caf is exemplary of the feelings the shop aims to emit PERIOD On the bonus side Richcreek seems rather capable of getting the job done PERIOD

Hes a MacGyver Garrett said PERIOD

During the shops transformation under the Five Points Coffee and Spice moniker only minimal renovations were needed including the installation of a new refrigerator and some rewiring  most of which Richcreek did himself PERIOD

Additionally the independent coffee shop serves up not just any coffee  but Richcreeks exclusive organic Alvas Five Points Blend brew of Joe roasted locally by Bold Bean Coffee Roasters PERIOD Garretts mom Christi handles the baking of homemade pastries for sale including an elusively delicious secret family recipe edition of carrot cake PERIOD

Most restaurants carrot cakes are like spice cake with carrot in it Mandie said PERIOD Ours is like carrot cake with spice in it. although Mandie has serious pride for her familys prized recipe she leaves the domestic cooking duties to her culinarily inclined beau PERIOD

Every night Richcreek whips up an 8aplate dinner special PERIOD The menu is whatever hes feeling varying from meatloaf garlic mashed potatoes and green beans to jerk chicken over ginger rice with field peas PERIOD

You will not walk out hungry Richcreek said PERIOD

Agreeing wholeheartedly with the above statement and tucked quietly behind the coffee shop by that hidden commercial kitchen is Diane Whitten and her shop Uncommon Thrift Gallery PERIOD

Whitten who ran Uncommon Grounds Coffee Co PERIOD from Jan PERIOD  through Dec PERIOD  in San Marco opened her shop within a shop about six weeks ago PERIOD

Like Richcreek Whitten hadnt planned on her launch of her store that is a hybrid between a thrift store compiled of things shes gathered over the years from her daughter from friends and original art including jewelry mosaic tables homemade shampoos and hand knit items PERIOD Whitten had wandered into the backroom randomly one day and was taken aback by the space PERIOD

It was kind of magical in some way Whitten said dreamily stretched out on a couch in her store PERIOD

She asked Richcreek if she could rent it out to which he obliged PERIOD The combination of the two joints has been a cohesive one thus far something Whitten described as completely separate and complimentary. i think Im good for him Whitten said PERIOD  Whitten loves the vibe Coffee and Spice has been sailing especially with their latenight food offerings hey they serve nosh til  a.m. and keeps her shop open until midnight for the more nocturnal javaheads PERIOD

Besides covering all the caffeine munchies sweet duds and unique art bases Coffee and Spice joined with The Gallery to kickstart live musical performances PERIOD The store intends on having acoustic nights every Thursday for local artists to perform to a coffeeloving audience PERIOD

Its a good community building Whitten said PERIOD

A fully unpretentious establishment indeed Garrett said Coffee and Spice is a melting pot of different cultures and a safe place PERIOD

So safe there has even been talk of Five Points Coffee and Spice and The Uncommon Thrift Gallery being a goto destination should an emergency break out PERIOD

If zombies ever attack this is where were coming Garrett said PERIOD  Check out Five Points Coffee and Spice online at fivepointscoffeeandspice.com and The Uncommon Thrift Gallery on Facebook PERIOD
