Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



February is ripe with holidays that provide opportunities for sarcasm Groundhog Day Valentines Day yet another commemorative holiday often draws critical commentary as the groundhog peeks its head out Black History Month PERIOD

To begin the time to think of America as a nation existing squarely amidst the blackwhite binary is over PERIOD An us v PERIOD them mentality has never been constructive and oversimplifies the complexities of race and race relations PERIOD

The reason Black History Month exists is not to incite some sort of race war or to dredge up feelings of guilt for any particular party remember the blackwhite binary need not apply in the present unless we choose to see the world through that false lens PERIOD

Instead Black History Month retells again and again a story that reveals some of the deepest disgusts and explosive triumphs of human spirit PERIOD Black History Month celebrates the blood sweat tears and lives that many Americans of all races and ethnicities gave to fight for the most basic kernel of human life human equality PERIOD All people deserve equal rights and  years ago bold courageous Americans fought a peaceseeking war against pervasive devastating injustice PERIOD

AfricanAmericans gained complete legal social and economic equality in the 1960s after hundreds of years approximately  years in the U.S PERIOD alone of prejudice racism and psychologically emotionally and physically destructive enslavement PERIOD Any U.S PERIOD citizen who questions Black History Month should first consider that the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in August  PERIOD Fifty years of legal equality stands minutely next to  years of racism in America not to speak of hundreds and hundreds of years of slavery under Europeans before Americas formation in the eighteenth century. black History Month also draws attention to the current plight of racial minority groups in the U.S PERIOD  specifically AfricanAmericans  and not only the past struggles these groups experienced PERIOD To believe American society exists in a postracial colorblind world is to look at the world with blinders on PERIOD Colorblindness assumes that all races and ethnicities begin at the same starting line in the U.S PERIOD and that race truly holds no weight PERIOD Yet the system of American government politics society and economics does not exclude races importance PERIOD The institutions and structures that create America in  do not intrinsically give all U.S PERIOD citizens the same opportunities PERIOD Statistics on the current racial wage gap raciallydetermined real estate value and the location of nearly all municipal garbage dumps in minority neighborhoods run rampant just to name a few PERIOD

Americans  who live in one of the most affluent countries on Earth  should not put their foot down over the supposed fairness or unfairness of a month celebrating and commemorating the history of intelligent influential and deeply sacrificial men and women like Rosa Parks Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD and W.E.B PERIOD DuBouis PERIOD Nor should Americans bare their teeth over a month celebrating a particular racial group no matter ones own race PERIOD

What matters is that we love those who served our nation in the past and present PERIOD What matters is that we shut down focuses on differences PERIOD What matters is that we look our heritage in the face and tell it that yes we understand where weve been  the places both disgusting and proud  and we look to where we go in the future PERIOD We look with cleareyed fullhearted clarity on the present state of race relations in the U.S PERIOD We have a responsibility to look at both Black History Month and the current state of America without unfair inaccurate preconceptions PERIOD

Heres to compassion before anger PERIOD Heres to selflessness before selfishness PERIOD Heres to apology before guilt and grace before guilt PERIOD And heres to love for our fellow humans before all else regardless of race history or the month PERIOD
