Participation points may not be the only loss for texting instead of paying attention in class PERIOD

A new app called Pocket Points will be looking to help students stay engaged in class by rewarding them with points thatcan later used at local Madison businesses PERIOD

University of Wisconsin students and Pocket Points Marketing Representatives Zachary Deal and Adam Haas said the app is simple PERIOD All the student has to do is turn on the app lock their phone and tally points PERIOD The less a student uses his or her phone the more points are earned PERIOD

Popularity of the app will also determine the growth of students points Deal said as more users means points will grow faster PERIOD

Haas said theywant to keep a growing presence on campus PERIOD They already have built a large following but if the amount of downloads continues to rise Pocket Points will have the potential to be used at a wider variety of businesses PERIOD

Pocket points is one of the first proven apps to keep students off of their cell phones in class and keep them able to pay attention Haas said PERIOD Its hard to not use your phone unless you have an incentive but a lot of people have been using it and have reported decreased phone use during class. while using gratification to initiate a response isnt a groundbreaking approach Haas said its one that has worked well for Pocket Points PERIOD

After students accumulate points they are then able to use them at Madison businesses that accept Pocket Points PERIOD So far there are 23in Madison such as Pizza Di Roma Subway and Liquid Nightclub PERIOD The pointscan also be used online PERIOD

Deal said they tried to get Ians Pizza on board with the app but an agreement could notbe made because Ians typically doesnt offer coupons or deals PERIOD But Haas and Deal both said they are always looking for new businesses to support the app PERIOD

Its fun Deal said PERIOD People enjoy earning points and tracking their progress as well as seeing what deals they canget. this article was published Sep   at  am and last
