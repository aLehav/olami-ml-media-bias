Before the Cowgirl basketball teams Tuesday night game against Texas AMCommerce head coach Kurt Budke said he wanted to see more scoring from players other than junior center Whitney Pegram PERIOD



Well he got exactly what he wanted PERIOD



Budke saw nine of his Cowgirls put points on the board in their  win against the Lions including his leading scorer Pegram who had a gamehigh  points PERIOD



Id rather have four in double figures than one with  Budke said PERIOD I just know the deeper we get into the season as we start playing the Big  teams you cant go into battle with just one bullet. pegram who also had eight rebounds in the game said it eases the pressure on her when people around her are scoring PERIOD



The spreading out of the scoring is awesome Pegram said PERIOD I think the Lions were crashing inside a lot early and because other people were stepping up and making plays that took a lot of the pressure out of the inside. one Cowgirl who stepped up at the right time against the Lions was junior guard Vivi Nascimento who had a careerhigh  points PERIOD



Budke said that Nascimento had been struggling before Tuesday nights game but that she came out and helped the Cowgirls put a second one in the win column PERIOD



The one thing shes been doing  shes continued to work hard in practice not get her head down and her time came tonight Budke said PERIOD We needed her and she did a good job. the last Cowgirl in double figures was senior guard Catherria Turner who had  points and shot 4for4 from the free throw line before being pulled late in the game PERIOD



Turner who leads OSU with  assists on the season had played for over  consecutive minutes before leaving Tuesdays game  a streak that stretched back to the Cowgirls Nov PERIOD  game against Idaho in the New Mexico Thanksgiving Tournament PERIOD



When I took her out I said See Im not going to let you play  minutes tonight Budke said PERIOD Thats a kid that can go  minutes every single night and thats comforting as a coach knowing you have someone that can do that. even walkon sophomore guard Nataly Gray got on the board when she came in at the end of the second half PERIOD Gray finished with five points including a threepointer that put the Cowgirls up  with  left in the game PERIOD



Nobody works harder than Nataly Budke said PERIOD When she came in tonight the game wasnt on the line but shes going to get a couple times this year when the games going to be on the line PERIOD Were going to need her to deliver and one thing you dont do you dont leave her open. pegram said spreading out the Cowgirls offensive duties is essential if OSU is to experience success during the rest of the season PERIOD



Thats going to have to happen and I think our guards have discovered that Hey Im going to get some easy baskets because my person will probably crash down Pegram said PERIOD So thats huge. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",Cowgirls learning to share the wealth  |  | ocolly.com,Oklahoma State University
