A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Last week the Kansas House of Representatives passed a bill that would have not only encouraged discrimination against homosexuals but would have legalized it PERIOD

House Bill  passed  was called the Religious Liberty Bill but it really aimed at taking away the rights of gay Kansans by sanctioning discrimination PERIOD The bill stated that No individual or religious entity shall be required by any governmental entity to do any of the following if it would be contrary to the sincerely held religious beliefs of the individual or religious entity regarding sex or gender provide any services accommodations advantages facilities goods or privileges provide counseling adoption foster care and other social services or provide employment or employment benefits related to or related to the celebration of any marriage domestic partnership civil union or similar arrangement. in America this kind of discrimination has not been legal since the hardfought Civil Rights movement PERIOD Its no secret that Kansas isnt exactly Greenwich Village but even this bit of proposed legislation was enough to shock the state PERIOD

House Bill  was stopped dead in its tracks due to a national wave of criticism PERIOD The Kansas Senate made it clear that the bill wasnt good for Kansas because it wasnt good for business and that it would never become law PERIOD But how dumb do they think we are We know that its not because of businesses that the bill was suddenly overturned PERIOD Who knows what would have happened if the nation would not have cried out in opposition

Although now the bill is considered dead it shouldnt have gotten as far as it did in the first place PERIOD Just because the bill doesnt use the word gay doesnt mean it is any less antigay PERIOD We wish our lawmakers would say what they mean instead of using overlybroad language in hopes that we wouldnt notice PERIOD

We seem to be moving backward in terms of equal rights PERIOD We fought this battle over  years ago with Civil Rights and it seems that this issue of discrimination keeps cropping up again and again PERIOD If you have any doubts about how unfair this kind of law really would be just replace sex or gender with color. kansas has become a banana republic of a state where basic human rights are endangered PERIOD Who are these representatives who claim to represent us How could  of them vote in favor of this bill Proposed laws like House Bill  are offensive no matter what your sexual or religious orientation PERIOD
