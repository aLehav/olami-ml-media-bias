Gerald Gerry Wood horn adjunct assistant professor plays his French horn Feb PERIOD  at Irons Recital Hall PERIOD Wood has played the instrument for over  years PERIOD

When Gerald Gerry Wood horn adjunct assistant professor received the call about his selection as principal horn for the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra he went through an emotional experience PERIOD

Its kind of strange to go from being a regular extra or a substitute to suddenly being the boss in the horn section Wood said PERIOD

He has been a member of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra since  as a substitute player and auditioned over  times for fulltime orchestra positions around the world PERIOD

Wood was third horn in the Dallas Opera Orchestra assistant principal horn in the Dallas Winds and a utility player for the Dallas and Fort Worth symphonies before becoming principal horn the lead player of an orchestras horn section PERIOD

Wood said he is overthemoon excited for the new position PERIOD He is also a little bit nervous about it but acknowledged that that comes with the territory PERIOD

Wood had his first official gig with the symphony Feb PERIOD  and his feet hadnt quite hit the ground PERIOD

He said he and his family were excited to hear he was the new principal horn for the symphony PERIOD His entire family also plays the French horn PERIOD

His love for music began in kindergarten and with singing in a first grade play then continued in junior high where he wanted to participate in the school band PERIOD

Wood said his mother loves choir and is a member of The RichTones Chorus a womens a cappella ensemble PERIOD She pushed him to join choir when he started junior high but Wood said he would rather be in band PERIOD

This decision probably had to do with his friends being in band and he thought it was cooler he said PERIOD

His mother eventually relented and allowed him to join PERIOD

Wood wanted to play trombone in sixth grade PERIOD He recalled his junior high band director looking at his scores on a music aptitude test telling Wood there werent any trombones left and offering him a French horn instead PERIOD

He participated in band throughout school then followed money offers to play French horn in college he said PERIOD

He has been a professional musician for several years and a freelancer in Arlington for about  PERIOD

Wood said hes always dreamt to get a fulltime orchestra position PERIOD

His accomplishments include marching with The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps and playing in regional orchestras and nationallyrenowned chamber ensembles including the American Wind Symphony Orchestra according to his UTA faculty profile PERIOD

At UTA Wood is the founder and director of The UTA Honors Horn Camp and the Bluebonnet Horn Festival according to his Fort Worth Symphony profile PERIOD

He is also a founding member of an internationallyrenowned horn quartet The Four Hornsmen of the Apocalypse PERIOD

He has been a member of the Texas Music Educators Association since  and the International Horn Society since  PERIOD

The Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra audition process can be grueling and stressful because it is held in multiple rounds said Martha Walvoord music department interim chair PERIOD A player initially auditions then plays the audition repertoire in several more rounds behind a screen so judges cant see the player PERIOD

Walvoord said it is fantastic to get through the process and be the one person chosen for the job PERIOD

Wood said he will continue teaching his students and coaching ensembles at UTA but he may have to cut back on his hours during the twoyear tenure process at the symphony PERIOD

Walvoord said students who want to play in ensembles will have the opportunity at UTA to be taught by a professor with a position in the symphony PERIOD

When a prospective student sees that their potential horn teacher is also the principal of a major symphony orchestra in this country its a real draw Walvoord said PERIOD

Dan Cavanagh College of Liberal Arts interim dean said Woods position in the symphony is valuable because it will bring aspects of his experience back to his students PERIOD

Its really great for our music department and continues to showcase what amazing faculty we have Cavanagh said PERIOD
