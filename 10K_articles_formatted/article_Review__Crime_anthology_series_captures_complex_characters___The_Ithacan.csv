6811,2023-07-26,"while Ryan Murphys American Horror Story is notorious for its gratuitous scenes of sex and violence his more recent series American Crime Story offers an unexpectedly neutral narrative investigation of the human condition PERIOD The excessive use of violence is avoided to focus on the humanity of the characters PERIOD In its sophomore season the anthology series centers on the true story of the delayed FBI manhunt to locate Andrew Cunanan Darren Criss a closeted gay FilipinoAmerican fugitive who killed five people including most notably the famous Italian designer Gianni Versace dgar Ramrez PERIOD Instead of relying on a formulaic trope of glorifying an immoral figure Cunanan in condemned PERIOD On the other hand Versaces wealthy lifestyle is portrayed as attainable an unlikely deviation that characterizes him as a neighbor colleague or friend PERIOD Here LGBTQ representation is successfully given the same complexities of heterosexual representation there are unfavorable benign and positive characterizations PERIOD

The shows first season The People v PERIOD O.J PERIOD Simpson American Crime Story addressed topics such as sexism in the workplace racial bias and media bias through the lens of the  O.J PERIOD Simpson trial PERIOD The Assassination of Gianni Versace American Crime Story investigates identity politics gay shame and political survival during the 90s by way of remaining in the closet PERIOD The title of the show is a misdirection because the show is not primarily about Versace  its predominantly a psychological profile of Cunanan PERIOD Cunanan killed four gay men starting with younger closeted men and elevating to wealthy unfaithful businessmen before moving on to Versace an openly gay man and representative of the gay community PERIOD

Versace is portrayed as Cunanans antithesis PERIOD His fame shielded him from antigay hostility while Cunanan remained closeted until his suicide PERIOD Versace was proud of his foreign status in America honoring his Italian origins with his designs while Cunanan tried to assimilate PERIOD Cunanan is not completely villainized just like Versace isnt portrayed as someone who is immune to selfloathing and criticism PERIOD Cunanan and Versace are an incompatible pair yet the show links them emotionally PERIOD This offers a complex character study that intensifies the dramatic storytelling PERIOD

The supporting characters are given their own arcs independent from the main characters which lends credibility to the writing and performances PERIOD After Versace is murdered his inner circle abandons each other PERIOD Versaces partner Antonio DAmico Ricky Martin is discarded by his sisterinlaw Donatella Versace Penlope Cruz in a misplaced reaction to her grief PERIOD In other projects Cruz is typecast as a sexualized Latina but here she is able to stretch her acting muscle and is given a satisfying emotional arc PERIOD She is caught in the crossfire of preserving the family empire and becoming autonomous from her dependence on her brother PERIOD Another supporting character a lesbian detective Lori Wieder Dascha Polanco is also welldeveloped and adds to the convincingness of the universe PERIOD She dismantles Cunanans plan in order to prevent damage to the reputation of the gay community PERIOD

The role of Cunanan is a welcome departure from Criss role as Blaine Anderson a charming openly gay high schooler on Glee another Ryan Murphy production PERIOD Criss portrays Cunanan as an articulate manipulative deviant who is ashamed of his identity PERIOD He victimizes younger men Jeffrey Trail Finn Wittrock and David Madson Cody Fern and is prostituted by older men such as Lee Miglin Mike Farrell PERIOD With each Criss convincingly plays a bully who is emotionally stunted PERIOD Criss performance is layered and shaded with nuance to show Cunanans mental decline PERIOD Its distressing to watch him become a victim of his worst inhibitions PERIOD This humanizes him but simultaneously viewers are reminded of his immoral actions and destructive status as a murderer PERIOD Criss is terrifyingly brilliant as Cunanan because he elicits pity as well as palpable fear PERIOD

Cunanan is an unreliable narrator who shifts identities to comfort others PERIOD The fictional pursuit of Versace by Cunanan fits within the narrative that these events are his fantasy PERIOD Theres no central perspective representing the audience surrogate beyond Cunanan which attaches pathos to a murderer PERIOD This narrative addition adds complexity to an otherwise onedimensional manipulative character PERIOD

Miami Beach is the location of Versaces murder and the production design references the youthful nostalgia and cinematic mood of the late 90s PERIOD The setting could have duplicated an aged antiquated postcard but here it looks accessible PERIOD Miami Beach serves as an additional character that either nourishes the characters health or is despondent when Cunanan responds to his violent urges PERIOD

The Assassination of Gianni Versace hopes to challenge homophobia just as The People v PERIOD O.J PERIOD Simpson offered political commentary on systemic racism but this critique isnt all there is to the show PERIOD The writing acting and production design is where the show finds its footing PERIOD The writing relies on identifiable bonds between characters but also develops them by showing complicated relationships PERIOD This twisting of tropes elevates the series to a detailed character study where positive portrayals of the LGBTQ experience are also visible PERIOD
