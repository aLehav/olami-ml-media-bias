Could digital media help us understand nineteenth century history Researchers at UR are compiling and preserving one prominent familys story using modern technology PERIOD Experts in multiple fields including some members of the Rochester community are collaborating on the Seward Family Project PERIOD Senior Tallis Polashenski a digital media studies and computer science major has been conducting interdisciplinary research in the history department for the last two years PERIOD

Polashenskis research focuses on William Henry Seward a nineteenth century New York senator governor and U.S PERIOD senator PERIOD Sewards political and family lives have interested historians and a breadth of primary sources provides an opportunity to delve into nineteenth century America PERIOD

Pioneered by professor Tom Slaughter in the UR history department the Seward Family Project has been integral in collecting and documenting these primary sources PERIOD With several other undergraduate and graduate students Polashenski transcribes digitizes and annotates historical documents including letters and diaries related to the Sewards PERIOD

Polashenski became interested in the project after speaking with Serenity Sutherland the former project manager of the Seward Family Digital Archive PERIOD From that Polashenski began thinking about the intersection of historical research and technology PERIOD

Slaughter has collected thousands of letters in binders which Polashenski is currently annotating and digitizing PERIOD She uses a document encoding system to upload them to the website and then performs quality checks of all the letters PERIOD She has been through over  letters PERIOD

Alongside other students Polashenski is also involved in transcribing the handwritten letters PERIOD They get help from senior citizens from the community as the majority of the letters are written in cursive PERIOD We joke that we have the tech skills but they have the handwriting skills Polashenski said PERIOD Its independent work but theres a lot of collaboration involved. this community involvement testifies to the growth of the project over the last seven years and extends to the Seward House museum in Auburn NY with whom the Rochester team shares primary sources PERIOD

The William Henry Seward Papers located in the Rare Books Special Collections and Preservation Department offer personal insight into the daily life of the Seward family PERIOD As the title indicates the Seward Family Project encompasses more than William PERIOD Most research about the Sewards is focused on political life Polashenski said PERIOD But these letters show a great understanding of the family sphere too. polashenskis immersion in the project offers her insights into the intimate details and personalities of the Seward family PERIOD William Henry Sewards dad is the funniest character in the family she said PERIOD He constantly writes that hes dying about  years before he actually dies to guilt his son into visiting him. the letters entail a fair amount of drama in addition to humor including an anecdote from the diary of Fanny Seward the daughter of William Henry Seward PERIOD In one entry she details the attempted assassination of her father in  PERIOD She was an eyewitness when the attacker stabbed William in the face and severely injured Fannys brother who needed surgery to remove a piece of skull lodged in his brain PERIOD

As a STEM student Polashenski did not expect her work on the Seward Family Project to lead to career opportunities PERIOD However she recently interviewed with an educational video game company in Rochester that wants to develop a game on womens suffrage PERIOD With this company Polashenski would work to incorporate primary sources into the game while maintaining a high entertainment value PERIOD

Polashenski exemplifies the benefits of engaging in diverse interests and experiences PERIOD In addition to the opportunities it has afforded her the Seward Family Project has been an enjoyable experience for Polashenski PERIOD Something cool is happening every day that youre working there she said PERIOD Its so personal it doesnt feel like broad history as much as understanding peoples lives.",Research Rochester: Polashenski uses digital media technology to preserve history - Campus Times,University of Rochester
