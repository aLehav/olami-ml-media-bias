Drinking on college campuses is nothing new and not exclusive to Augustana but the culture of drinking to fit in with the rest of the crowd does raise some cause for concern PERIOD

Drinking is a part of college life but if students are unable to drink responsibly there is a chance of longlasting medical setbacks PERIOD After seeing underage drinking firsthand and what drinking to excess can do Augustana takes clear steps to help its students PERIOD

One resource that Augustana has if students feel unsafe to drive and need to get back to campus is ACES a studentrun carpool service that runs from seven in the morning to  in the morning PERIOD

Another resource that students can use is oncampus counseling sessions where students can speak to someone about concerns they dont feel comfortable saying to large groups of people PERIOD

In an interview with Farrah Roberts director of student wellbeing and resiliency she brings up how not everyone in college drinks PERIOD

Its not actually as common as everyone thinks it is PERIOD A lot of students choose not to drink andor not to binge drink PERIOD We also share the realities of the negative effects of alcohol use on academics social life and on personal safety Roberts said PERIOD

There are many activities around campus that do not involve the consumption of alcohol including those highlighted in Augustanas commemoration of April as Alcohol Awareness month PERIOD The most recent was a drag show in the Lindberg Center called Night of Noise PERIOD

The OSL puts on amazing student events every week that are  alcoholfree and thats a great option Roberts said PERIOD

Wanting to drink is completely normal for students but when they drink excessively it can become a health hazard PERIOD Drinking impacts people in different ways so it is important to voice concerns about excessive drinking PERIOD

Roberts also mentions what the drinking culture is like at Augustana PERIOD

From an administrative perspective things have shifted for the better over the last several years PERIOD Weve seen less dangerous levels of alcohol use and less repeat offenders of alcohol violations PERIOD Of course things can always be better and we welcome student feedback about what theyre seeing Roberts said PERIOD

One of the things students can do to help those who are drinking irresponsibly is to check on how they are doing PERIOD

Roberts says a big thing to remember is the three Ds PERIOD

Direct Directly speak to the student PERIOD Distract Trying to find a way to change the situation safely without directly confronting it in that moment PERIOD Delegate Find help from someone in a place of authority or someone more equipped to handle the situation Roberts said PERIOD

The three Ds can be helpful to students if they dont feel safe or comfortable calling someone out on their drinking PERIOD

For example distracting them can make the situation less intimidating PERIOD Going up to someone who isnt acting like themselves can be difficult so offering a distraction such as asking them to get food or watch a movie is a good way of avoiding these obstacles while addressing drinking concerns PERIOD

Since the start of my college career in  there has been peer pressure to drink an issue faced by many college students PERIOD

Excessive and underage drinking is a problem but with some of the workshops resources and education Augustana provides it has taken the necessary steps to prevent the dangers of irresponsible drinking PERIOD
