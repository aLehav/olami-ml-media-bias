2356,2023-10-26,"a year ago Johnny Hamui was getting ready for his second season in the SEC part of a talented No PERIOD  Florida squad preparing for its season opener against Furman PERIOD

This year hes preparing for another season opener this time against No PERIOD  Virginia PERIOD The difference Hes at a new school nearly  miles away PERIOD And while Hamui was an opponent last year when the Gators and Illini faced off on Feb PERIOD   a  Illinois win  hes one of five new players to join the Illinois roster in  PERIOD

Its unbelievable Hamui said PERIOD Its a little cold outside and its raining a bit but everything else has been outstanding. joining Hamui are four freshmen  three of whom are not from the United States  who are all fighting to contribute for the No PERIOD  Illini PERIOD They have a chance to make a big splash Friday in front of a home crowd if they see the court and take a few wins from perennial powerhouse Virginia PERIOD

Well see how the freshmen are able to adapt under the bright lights of Big Ten dual match competition Illinois head coach Brad Dancer said PERIOD



I think theres a learning curve in terms of the length of the season but match to match ultimately its just one individual tennis match that it comes down to Dancer added PERIOD We wouldnt have recruited them if we didnt think they could play singles and doubles and so forth  We believe in their talent level we believe in their mental tenacity. six players from last years team left for various reasons PERIOD Brian Livingston and Marc Spicijaric graduated Waylon Chin transferred to Miami FL and Billy Heiser Roy Kalmanovich and Ruan Roelofse left the team for personal reasons PERIOD But Dancer is excited to see how his new players can fill the roles left vacant with the six departures PERIOD

Weve got so many new guys PERIOD We basically have half of a new team here right now Dancer said PERIOD And I think the biggest thing is the acclimation PERIOD You know how theyre going to go about that being thrust into the spotlight right away. leading the Illini into the new season is sophomore Dennis Nevolo PERIOD Nevolo ranked No PERIOD  in the nation will likely fill the No PERIOD  singles spot after finishing  with a  dualmatch record and  overall PERIOD While Nevolo contributed heavily last year the  Illini appear to be his team PERIOD

I feel pretty loose right now Nevolo said PERIOD Virginia is obviously a very tough team PERIOD Im really excited to see how the new guys perform and how I perform in our first match PERIOD It should be a good time so well see. nevolo and senior Marek Czerwinski form the No PERIOD  doubles tandem in the nation going in although Dancer said the two will not likely be paired Friday against the Cavaliers PERIOD Who will play together however is a mystery to everyone but Dancer PERIOD

Doubles will be interesting Dancer said PERIOD Itll be new for us PERIOD Were going to have some teams that maybe havent had the experience out there in dualmatch competition  I like our energy in doubles a lot PERIOD I think thats to be a big positive and plus for us PERIOD Weve got guys that have a little chemistry together and play with good tenacity. no matter what the lineup looks like  and it will look different  the Illini are excited to come out with a lot of energy to start  at the Atkins Tennis Center PERIOD

You have all the summer you have all the fall you have all these other things and now dualmatch season is finally upon us Dancer said PERIOD So Im sure the guys will be nervous Im sure therell be jitters but I think were all looking forward to it.","After major overhaul, No. 15 Illini menâ€™s tennis set to host No. 2 Virginia in season opener - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
