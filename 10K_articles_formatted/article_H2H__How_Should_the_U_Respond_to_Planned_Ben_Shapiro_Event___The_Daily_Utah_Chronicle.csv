The nation is focused on the University of Utah as Ben Shapiro will soon appear on campus PERIOD Hosted by the Universitys Young Americans for Freedom YAF Chapter Shapiros upcoming appearance has already affected discourse on campus PERIOD Those who ordinarily avoid speaking about politics are suddenly reflecting on their values questioning how the First Amendment right to free speech applies to controversial figures PERIOD These uncensored discussions led to the Chicanx Student Movement of Aztln MEChA and the Students for a Democratic Society SDS demanding that the speech on Sept PERIOD  be cancelled PERIOD President David G PERIOD Pershing responding to these requests announced that the event will continue as scheduled PERIOD

Last week UC Berkeley braced as Hurricane Shapiro arrived on campus PERIOD The university reportedly paid local authorities  for event security  a ludicrous sum for a single evening PERIOD The Salt Lake City Police Department attended the event observing how violence was prevented PERIOD Although protesters did emerge there was little else done to prevent the speech PERIOD Unfortunately life near UC Berkeley was put on hold as police barricaded streets and established checkpoints PERIOD The campus transformed overnight thus resembling a town in the pathway of a storm PERIOD For comparison Shapiros speech at UC Berkeley lasted roughly two hours  preparing for the event took hundreds of hours to ensure safety PERIOD Is this how free speech in the United States should operate

I spoke with the Chair of YAF Dillon Clark about the upcoming event on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Glancing at any of the protest pages on Facebook one imagines that Clark is surely bent on disrupting the status quo PERIOD That characterization could not be further from the truth PERIOD Responding to the recent criticism Clark told me When you listen to people you disagree with you can gain a better understanding of their argument why they think that way how they came to that conclusion. he continued by stating If you can do that not only can you broaden your overall understanding of a subject but you can adopt new views or harden your own Disagreeing with his interpretation is rather difficult as Shapiros entire career is focused on education and lively discussion PERIOD

Shapiro is a Harvard Law alumnus with significant intellectual prowess PERIOD His speech at the U will be brimming with statistics and those who disagree with Shapiro can skip to the front of the QA line PERIOD As Clark told me earlier this week Ben Shapiro is popular for a reason and people need to interact and engage with speakers like Ben to gain a better understanding of why and how people like him so much. those requesting that Pershing cancel Shapiros speech center their argument around the term hate speech. alternatively his opinions do not align with the progressive movement and are therefore harmful PERIOD The political firebrand is admittedly not an admirer of the LGBTQIA movement indeed many of Shapiros comments severely aggravate leftists for this reason alone PERIOD Notice how I did not say liberals as Democrats traditionally admire free speech PERIOD I wrote leftists to acknowledge social justice activists such as Lex Scott founder of the United Front Party who want to dismantle open dialogue PERIOD

The movement that Scott and others represent in Utah has evoked a resistance to controversial ideas evident in the title of the protest organized against Shapiro PERIOD CounterProtest to the hate speech of Ben Shapiro at the U reads the Facebook groups heading PERIOD Wait counterprotest to what exactly Shapiro might be controversial but his appearances are guaranteed by the United States Constitution PERIOD Furthermore the event is being hosted by a reputable organization and the University is aware of all details PERIOD Terming Shapiros educated rhetoric as a protest reveals a lack of understanding for how free speech operates PERIOD

There are limitations to the First Amendment but Shapiro is neither preaching violence nor chaosconservative speakers should not be viewed as counterculture PERIOD No one is forcing the audience to attend and if anything disruptive protests actually attract more people to the venue PERIOD Instead of asking President Pershing to cancel Shapiro groups like MEChA SDS and Lex Scott should establish their own speeches PERIOD On Sept PERIOD   at  p.m. you have a choice either attend the speech or choose to stay at home PERIOD Either way Shapiro is coming to the U thanks to Clark and a few others who recognize the value of free speech PERIOD

Connor Richards

The normal quietness and lack of action that defines the University of Utahs Park Building was absent on the afternoon of Sept PERIOD  PERIOD It was replaced by the voices yells and drumbangs of about  U students who took part in a sitin outside President David W PERIOD Pershings office PERIOD The protest which was organized by the Us chapter of Chicanx Student Movement of Aztln MEChA and supported by Students for a Democratic Society SDS and the Black StudentUnion was against conservative commentator Ben Shapiro who will be speaking at the U on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Armed with harmonious chants and the synchronized beating of bass drums the students demanded President Pershing cancel Shapiros talk PERIOD

Pershing before being escorted out of the building by three police officers and a campus official came out of his office to listen to the concerns of students PERIOD He said that while the university has a strong commitment to diversity it is out of the universitys control to cancel a speaker invited by a student group Shapiro was invited by the Us chapter of Young Republicans PERIOD The policy of the university is that a fullyregistered student group has the right just like you the protesters do to invite speakers Pershing said according to The Daily Utah Chronicle PERIOD The jurisdiction we have is safety. the protest created outrage among the Utah community and led to accusations that the protesters are intolerant of conservative ideas and voices PERIOD Nothing could be farther from the truth PERIOD When Mitt Romney spoke at Kingsbury Hall in March  there was no organized opposition by leftwing groups PERIOD Similarly no leftists organizations attempted to cancel the conservativeleaning Evan McMullins speech when he made a presidential campaign stop at the U PERIOD With both of these recent instances in mind it seems inaccurate to accuse U students of wanting to shut down conservative ideas values and voices PERIOD

But Shapiro is not Mitt Romney or Evan McMullin PERIOD It isnt Shapiros conservative tendencies that leftist students groups are hostile towards  it is his hateful and degrading comments towards minority groups PERIOD Shapiro consistently labels transgenderism as a mental illness and refers sex reassignment surgery as selfmutilation PERIOD He has repeatedly misgendered Caitlyn Jenner and scoffed at the idea that it takes any bravery to come out as transgender PERIOD When one student called him out for his insensitive rhetoric Shapiro asked If I call you a moose are you suddenly a moose

Shapiro is a coward PERIOD Rather than own and embrace his all too apparent disgust for transgender people he hides it behind a poorly constructed veil of objectivity using outdated psychology research on gender dysphoria to promote what is nothing more than hatred for people who are different from him PERIOD Shapiros catchphrase is facts dont care about your feelings as if he held his opinions on any intellectual grounds and not on outright prejudice PERIOD

The debate as to whether the U should host Shapiro centers around the idea the universities should be welcoming of all opinions and that the First Amendment of the U.S PERIOD Constitution protects Shapiros right to speak PERIOD The idea that universities must allow all invited speakers whatever their beliefs to speak on campus is a nonsensical one PERIOD Universities exist to promote and harbor productive intellectual ideas not to offer a freeforall forum where all ideas however out of whack are treated as equally valuable PERIOD There is a reason universities do not offer courses in alchemy and astrology these ideas have little intellectual merit PERIOD

Allowing Shapiro to speak simply because he was invited sets a dangerous precedent for what kind of speech can be promoted on the U campus PERIOD What if a student group invites a speaker who believes Sandy Hook was staged by the Obama administration or that the Holocaust never happened or that vaccinations cause autism Should the U feel obligated to gives these ideas I platform No and it would be dangerously irresponsible to do so PERIOD

Controversial figures have been uninvited from the U before PERIOD In  the rapper Asher Roth was invited by ASUU to headline the Us annual Redfest to kick off the school year PERIOD ASUU revoked the invitation however after concerns were raised that the rappers lyrics contradicted ASUUs efforts to improve the campus climate. if a musicians lyrics can be so disruptive to campus climate as to justify the cancellation of their performance the same can certainly be said of Shapiros comments towards transgender people PERIOD It is high time colleges stopped providing hate with a platform and instead recognized that not all ideas deserve to be taken seriously in a university setting PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Robert Craigen									  									Sep   at  pm

Connor I didnt get past your title  I have only so much tolerance for uninformed bluster and your title is a clear indication that what you have to say is flush with it PERIOD

Ive read enough screeds with essentially that sentiment as an overriding theme Ive insufficient patience left with such to digest any more looking for scraps of reasonable commentary PERIOD  Never in all those antiShapiro screeds Ive read have I seen any substantial evidence of objectively hateful things Shapiro says or does PERIOD  He is provocative  yes PERIOD  So are you PERIOD  So is any speaker in todays political climate that is worth listening to left right or center PERIOD  The hate label is nowadays too often only a substitute for intelligent engagement with an articulate opponent PERIOD Reasonable people no longer have time for that nonsense PERIOD  Get over the fact that its hard to answer his arguments on their own terms and more facile just to make up labels to stick on him to excuse yourself from that hard work PERIOD

I dont doubt there are a few things hes said some can TAKE  and INTERPRET in hateful ways PERIOD  But Shapiro is clearly demonstrably not a hateful person and no honest rendering of anything Ive ever heard him say is consistent with that characterization PERIOD  This comes from one who has followed and read Shapiro for many years  if there was hate to be found I would have come across it PERIOD  The mere fact that its so hard to produce actual examples and that nobody ever does is a clear enough demonstration that youre tilting at windmills like everyone else who swings this particular cudgel in his direction PERIOD

Let me tell you a bit about Shapiro and Hate PERIOD

Shapiro is an important TARGET of hate PERIOD  For one he was identified by the Leftwing Anti Defamation League as the number one target worldwide of antijew hate attacks during  PERIOD  He has to travel with bodyguards because of ongoing credible threats against his personal safety PERIOD

Now I sincerely doubt you intend any antisemetic hate toward him in your probably wellmeaning but misguided attack on Mr PERIOD Shapiro PERIOD

However finding yourself joining forces with some of the most hateful mobs in political life today and piling on your efforts to theirs to silence and marginalize him  ought to at least give you some pause PERIOD  But apparently in the Left today that kind of selfawareness has become a rarity PERIOD

Kathleen									  									Sep   at  pm

Connor you are one of my new favorite people PERIOD Thank you for such an educated authentic opinion piece PERIOD Attaching your name to your criticisms is incredibly brave and I am very grateful to you for using your privilege platform and freedom of expression to speak out for those who may feel afraid or unable to do so PERIOD

The First Amendment in the United States Constitution reads that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech. the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution in this amendment prevents the United States Congress from prohibiting or abridging the freedom of speech PERIOD It does not guarantee Ben Shapiro or any other speaker an appearance or a platform at this University PERIOD I disagree with Nicholas when they write that it does PERIOD

That first amendment however absolutely protects and ensures that Connor Nicholas and the rest of the press at the Chronicle the right to freely speak as they have done in this H2H article PERIOD It also protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble in protest and petition PERIOD For those who choose to protest this event tonight I am excited to stand in petition and exercise my constitutional rights with you PERIOD

Thank you again Connor PERIOD Great work PERIOD

Tyler									  									Sep   at  pm

I almost saw him speak in California but the crowd had blocked all entrances PERIOD I plan to try to see him speak at the U of U now that Im in Utah PERIOD I hope our great state and university can handle diverse opinions and accept free speech better than California did PERIOD Great article

Robert									  									Sep   at  pm

 of millennials believe speech should be regulated that hate speech be illegal PERIOD  Its time for the other  of us to stand up and oppose what amounts to the repealing of the First Amendment PERIOD  College and university campuses are only the first battleground PERIOD  Defend your First Amendment rights before its too late PERIOD

JerBo									  									Sep   at  pm

Robertthis IS the Bottom Line On a personal level I dont put up with letting the liberals jabber on.I challenge their view points Heres an example    Abortion is clearly the taking of an innocent life. this is easy to point out PERIOD Point out that there will NEVER be another child that has this DNAits a one of a kind child that is being MURDERED       Heres another one Al Gore the Climate Change guru point out that   just  of his houses uses  times more energy that the average home    Orange is the new black..And Liberals are the new LOOOOOSERS 

Scott									  									Sep   at  pm

At one time hate speech was saying that the world is round PERIOD They would never allow someone to speak this idea publicly PERIOD People are afraid of hate speech because it does not endorse their ideas PERIOD People who want to protest such speeches are afraid of something PERIOD What that is depends on the person PERIOD And what is HateSpeech Give an operational definition of this PERIOD HateSpeech is the same as equality PERIOD So many definitions and perceptions of what this means PERIOD

JG									  									Sep   at  pm

Apparently Hate Speech is now defined as any opinion that challenges your own PERIOD With that in mind I now formally accuse Connor Richards of Hate Speech because he is freely expressing his opinion that I simply do not agree with PERIOD Would anyone care to join me at President Pershings office to protest in order to suppress Connor Richards First Amendment Rights
I wasnt even interested in attending this event until I realized how many people are trying to oppress him PERIOD The last time I heard groups of people attacking a practicing Jew they called it the Holocaust PERIOD Knowing that about Shapiro what do these protesters call it now

Don Lewis									  									Sep   at  pm

Soon the company making the loud speaker system will demand it not be used for conservative speech PERIOD  Then the power company PERIOD  Then the water company PERIOD  The cell towers PERIOD  The satellites PERIOD

Riley									  									Sep   at  am

It is not surprising that an illegal theocracy like the state of Utah aligned with the beliefs of a xenophobic religion and shaping its public policy accordingly would welcome at its flag ship public research University a pseudointellectual like Ben Shapiro with his well organized talking points for justifying hateful beliefs as if belief is equates to knowledge PERIOD

Why doesnt Ben Shapiro challenge the fact that there is an LDS institute sensoring free speech at the University of Utah influencing policy there PERIOD Lets see if the U of U would welcome him then being that all of its key leaders are Mormon which is by design PERIOD

L PERIOD Edwards									  									Sep   at  am

Evidence please PERIOD

Adam S PERIOD									  									Sep   at  pm

It is obvious Riley that you are either not from Utah or do not pay attention to your surroundings PERIOD If this were not the case then you would be fully aware that the University of Utah is a predominantly liberal university and your claim that the government of Utah or the LDS church has anything to do with President Pershings decision to allow this talk is unfounded PERIOD I add my voice to Edwards where is the evidence The Salt Lake Institute the LDS institute to which I assume you are referring is an independent entity from the university and has no power over the decisions made therein PERIOD

Judging by the grammatical errors in your comment as well as Richards it is evident that you both were very emotional when writing your responses and failed to take the time to proofread PERIOD The way you have conveyed your opinion about the LDS religion whether intentionally or not is quite on par with the way Ben Shapiro conveys his opinions PERIOD Do I not now have the right by your very own standards to label your words as hateful Shall I demand your comment be deleted Are you not doing the very thing you accuse Shapiro of doing that is justifying hateful beliefs as if belief equates to knowledge I am exasperated by the level of hypocrisy contained in arguments for preventing this speech PERIOD

Ben Shapiro has people who disagree with him scared because they are finding it difficult to make substantial counter arguments PERIOD Let me be clear PERIOD I am not advocating that his opinions are right PERIOD I myself disagree with several of his positions PERIOD But I am calm enough to observe that many liberals are selfimpairing their ability to combat opposing views because they refuse to give audience to such things or even allow others to hear them PERIOD Since they are uninformed of the ACTUAL positions of their opponent their arguments become weak PERIOD They then resort to character attacks and demand more censorship as this is the only effective tactic left and the vicious cycle continues PERIOD In my opinion liberals hoping to convince others that their views are correct cannot afford to miss this speech PERIOD Similarly conservatives with the same desires cannot afford to miss a prominent liberal discourse PERIOD

Riley									  									Sep   at  pm

Then why isnt there a muslim institute so prominently situated right up against the campus PERIOD Would it be allowed

In addition  I invite you to personally survey all the key leadership of the University of Utah U of U and ask them their religion PERIOD You know what their answers are going to be PERIOD

Also I am from Utah PERIOD My ancestors were here before it was stolen from them after the war with Mexico and I am observant of my surroundings Mormon white supremacy is everywhere in this statee.g. this state fell to Donald Trump during the last presidential election PERIOD

Moreover the University of Utah U of U is not as liberal as the watereddown liberals in Utah think it is or the conservatives in Utah think it is PERIOD The U of U is not a quintessential example of intellectual excellence like the University of California at Berkeley nor is Utah an economic power house and epicenter of innovation like California California is that way because of its diversity and secular government which is one of the best examples in the United States of a government of the people by the people for the people such a government is best accomplished by a secular government one free from relying on myths like those about the origins of the universe an after life etc.morality is found in the present moment PERIOD

Finally speech or print isnt hateful just because it is intolerant of intolerence PERIOD Theres a difference between discernment and judgement PERIOD Pointing out injustice isnt unjust PERIOD Just because the Nazis party was opposed doesnt mean people were intolerant fascist dont have the right to annihilate people who dont fit their accepted profile and  people will leave fascists alone if they dont try to annihilate them PERIOD Oh and correct Donald Trumps spelling and grammar PERIOD He could actually use the help. adam S PERIOD									  									Sep   at  am

I thought I had made my point clear but apparently I did not PERIOD

 PERIOD I did not accuse you of being intolerant of intolerance PERIOD I did not even accuse you of being intolerant of Ben Shaprio PERIOD I DID accuse you of being intolerant of religion an accusation for which you so conveniently provided more evidence in your last rebuttal PERIOD I likened your rhetoric to that of Ben Shaprio as evidence of your hypocrisy PERIOD It is outrageous and disrespectful for you to use a religion namely the Muslim religion as leverage to promote your intolerance of religion PERIOD By your very ideals of religion and government described in detail in your own words you obviously dont believe that ANY religious institute should be allowed to be built near a public university PERIOD You answered your own question in a way that negates the effectiveness and purpose of asking the question of the first place PERIOD There is a Jewish Community Center on campus as well also independently operated from the university which is obvious since neither of them are allowed to use the name of the university or its logos PERIOD Are you aware of this Are you going to accuse Jews of controlling the University of Utah as well Of course a Muslim mosque or institute or any type of facility of their choosing would be allowed There is talk on campus right now seeking to address this issue PERIOD But you wouldnt know that because you refuse to pay attention to reality PERIOD And you say you promote diversity

 PERIOD Why dont we conduct this survey together I would LOVE to hold your hand and walk you into each and every office of the administration at the University of Utah and ask them This person is claiming that you are in bed with the LDS Church and that you are in fact LDS but has no evidence to back up this claim PERIOD Would you like the opportunity to correct this person I guarantee YOU that they would be offended and shocked by such allegations PERIOD YOU were the one that made the original claim without evidence and the responsibility to provide such evidence falls upon YOU PERIOD I am serious about this PERIOD Lets go together like civilized intellectuals PERIOD My number is 

 PERIOD Oh yes the wonderful University of California at Berkeley What a shining example of intellectual excellence it is to violently riot and cause  worth of damages in February PERIOD What immense maturity it demonstrates to violently confront opposing views in April and August PERIOD It takes a certain kind of intelligence to advocate for and successfully achieve a ban on pepper spray for use in the police force and then become the perfect counter example of the very thing you advocated by driving the police in the city of Berkeley to repeal the ban and spend  in security all in response to the fear of your own violent behavior PERIOD Might I remind you that UC Berkeley however reluctantly chose to allow Ben Shaprio to speak PERIOD If Berkeley is so wonderful and can do no wrong then why are you condemning the University of Utah for doing the VERY SAME THING PERIOD Again hypocrisy at its finest PERIOD And all this ironically occurs at the university known to be The birthplace of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s PERIOD

 PERIOD I give no support for Donald J PERIOD Trump PERIOD I have no affiliation with the man nor did I vote for him PERIOD I completely AGREE with you that his grammar is awful and he carries himself like a buffoon PERIOD You have no idea what my political affiliations are and you assume that because I disagree with you I must be a supporter of Mr PERIOD Trump and therefore you can discredit me by bringing him into the discussion PERIOD This is a brash assumption albeit not a surprising one given that your entire argument has been founded on assumption PERIOD

Pablo									  									Sep   at  pm

Riley
It is not surprising that an illegal theocracy like the state of Utah aligned with the beliefs of a xenophobic religion
What an astoundingly ignorant thing to say PERIOD Aside from being demonstrably false in every conceivable way your first statement alone indicates that you have passed judgement upon an entire group of people based on woeful misunderstanding and glaring closed mindedness PERIOD I think you would call that prejudice and bigotry if directed at a politically favored protected minority group actually Mormons ARE a minority PERIOD Even in Salt Lake City PERIOD
I guess that only leaves me questioning Why so hateful and bigoted Riley..

Riley									  									Sep   at  pm

Mormons are not a minority in Utah and they weild the power of a state goverment which is illegal the U.S PERIOD Constitution adamantly calls for the separation of church and state PERIOD

Moreover for being an oppressed minority group if thats wholly true they seem to have no problem oppressing nonmormonsand they are overwhelmingly endorsing of the Republican party PERIOD

T.L PERIOD									  									Sep   at  pm

Riley  reread the U.S PERIOD Constitution nowhere therein is a separation of church and state adamantly called for PERIOD The term separation of church and state was coined many many years after the ratification of the constitution by Thomas Jefferson as a response addressing the ramifications of the first amendment PERIOD Reading Thomas Jeffersons letter it becomes apparent that he was using it to describe to prohibition of the federal government interfering with religious pursuits and practices not the other way around PERIOD

Tanner J PERIOD									  									Sep   at  am

Ill start with the typographical errors PERIOD

Correct the second sentence of paragraph four to read It isnt Shapiros conservative tendencies that leftist student groups are hostile towardsit is his hateful and degrading comments towards minority groups. it currently says students groups. correct the third sentence of paragraph four to read Shapiro consistently labels transgenderism as a mental illness and refers to sex reassignment surgery as selfmutilation. it currently says and refers sex reassignment surgery as selfmutilation. also correct the third sentence of paragraph seven to read Should the U feel obligated to give these ideas a platform It currently says obligated to gives these ideas I platform. now for the content PERIOD

The protest created outrage among the Utah community and led to accusations that the protesters are intolerant of conservative ideas and voices PERIOD Nothing could be farther from the truth. they along with you and many liberals absolutely are intolerant of some conservative ideas e.g PERIOD LGBT issues PERIOD You spend half of this article talking about how hateful degrading dangerous prejudiced and out of whack his views are of transgenderism PERIOD To you and the leftist camp there is no moral or rational opinion about this other than your own anything else is worthy of the hate label PERIOD

He has repeatedly misgendered Caitlyn Jenner

You certainly have the right to use the term woman however you want PERIOD But Shapiros argument is that the rest of us have the right to call a spade a spade PERIOD This obviously bothers you and it seems to be your biggest problem with him PERIOD But let me tell you something the students in the Union cafeteria have the right to laugh with each other about how my Church is actually a cult while I eat my hamburger five feet away from them PERIOD Trust me things like that make me feel much like you do when Ben calls Caitlyn Jenner a him. my business professor apparently has the right to endorse and quote the Book of Mormon musical during his lectures a piece of work that makes Ben Shapiros rhetoric look like a flower arrangement PERIOD Should I complain to President Pershing that hes using a university platform to spread insensitive views and demand that he be sent away How about my philosophy professor who peppered his lectures with derogatory comments about LDS religious texts When my business professor saw that what he said made some of us uncomfortable he told our class I believe in the right to offend. this is a difficult principle for most people including me PERIOD But we need to accept it and learn to deal with it because at some point or another a university environment will expose us to irritating or offensive ideologies PERIOD This offense and dislike is the price we all pay for the first amendment PERIOD Whats annoying about these protestors is that theyre suddenly crying foul now that its their turn to pay PERIOD

and scoffed at the idea that it takes any bravery to come out as transgender. this is an example of Bens tendency to overcorrect PERIOD He is pushing back against societys praise of the transgender movement by acting like it doesnt matter or even exist which I really dont like PERIOD He would be better received if he wasnt so emotionally charged PERIOD

The idea that universities must allow all invited speakers whatever their beliefs to speak on campus is a nonsensical one PERIOD Universities exist to promote and harbor productive intellectual ideas not to offer a freeforall forum where all ideas however out of whack are treated as equally valuable PERIOD There is a reason universities do not offer courses in alchemy and astrology these ideas have little intellectual merit. so who are the judges of intellectual merit Who gets to decide which ideas are productive and which ones are out of whack You suggest that the process would be simple like differentiating pseudosciences from valid sciences PERIOD But political and moral opinions dont work like that PERIOD Whoever is in charge of judging merit you seem convinced that they should use leftwing thought as a model and that social and moral propositions ought to meet some liberal standard to be considered acceptable PERIOD Anything reasonably close to your philosophies is fine but its time to hyperventilate and demand justice when someone wont call Caitlyn Jenner a woman because he put on a dress PERIOD Then comes the outrage about how this is nothing but hate transphobia prejudice bigotry etc PERIOD There are of course no other explanations PERIOD

Allowing Shapiro to speak simply because he was invited sets a dangerous precedent for what kind of speech can be promoted on the U campus PERIOD What if a student group invites a speaker who believes Sandy Hook was staged by the Obama administration or that the Holocaust never happened or that vaccinations cause autism Should the U feel obligated to gives these ideas I platform No and it would be dangerously irresponsible to do so. again the proposition here is that Shapiros opinions are as dangerous and obviously wrong as holocaust denial and vaccine paranoia PERIOD Most people dont buy that PERIOD

Finally the University of Utah is not giving these ideas a platform PERIOD The private student group that invited him to speak is PERIOD The  rap concert cancellation isnt a fair comparison because the ASUU is sponsored by and directly affiliated with the University whereas YAF is not PERIOD President Pershing understands this PERIOD

Blanca Vasquez									  									Sep   at  pm

We dont need to show class but humanity and respect for other peoples ideals or beliefs PERIOD If Mrs PERIOD Shapiro shows respect and decency for other peoples or cultures or ideals and then Im sure he will be respected and even if we dont like his speech we are adults and we can take it PERIOD But if he begins to bring the worst on people then I dont think that he will be respected PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Robert Craigen									  									Sep   at  pm

Blanca what you are articulating in your concluding sentence here is essentially what is called the Hecklers or Mobs Veto  It is the idea that you can shut down an opponent by threatening violence in response  the fact of that violence is then taken as evidence that the persons speech is invalid or should not be tolerated merely on the basis of the reaction PERIOD

Because this has become such an effective tactic in recent years there is an acceleration of the frequency of groups using the hecklers veto as a lazy way of avoiding engagement with articulate opponents more fluent in the facts behind arguments than yourself PERIOD  And this is definitely what Shapiro is PERIOD  He is not by any objective measure objectionable though you may object to the positions he takes PERIOD  He is a reasonable charitable and nonthreatening speaker PERIOD  But he is hard to answer  and THATS what has people riled up PERIOD

Please dont throw your weight behind the hecklers veto PERIOD

Ryan									  									Sep   at  pm

Lets do better than Berkeley please PERIOD Let the man speak PERIOD If you disagree with his position debate in a respectful manner PERIOD Protest in a peaceful manner PERIOD Violence does not prove your point or further your agenda it makes you look like compete nutjobs PERIOD This is The U PERIOD Lets show some class shall we

JerBo									  									Sep   at  pm

So far the Left have shown their TRUE CHARACTERLittle to No Class I reflect on the Womens March who left out womens groups who where Prolife and used hateful language during their speeches and how about their wearing their female reproductive units on their headsNow you talk about classless    Remember the Take Over Wall Street fiasco these sad creatures TRASHED the parks they took over PERIOD The Lefties are a Dangerous Joke PERIOD They support the MURDERING of BABIES in the WOMByet they say they are the ones who CARE    Heres a good one   Bill Clinton    The Poster Boy for Mister NO CLASS  Hes having sex in the Ovar Office as hes sending our troops to go fight in the Faulkins  what a piece of work these ELITIST SLIM  are PERIOD   and believe me the Republicans ARE NO BETTER  My grandpa used to say Ya get what ya DESERVE sonny boy   And America is going to REAP THE WHIRLWIND  Hope yer ready friend

Michael Stewart									  									Sep   at  pm

Neither of these writings are particularly interesting PERIOD Both writers have rehashed the same argument on both sides thats been around for months a year longer probably PERIOD And its the same criticisms PERIOD Where is the point that people will actually sit down and reach some sort of decision about this information after talking about it Richards main method seems to be an attack that Haha He says Caitlyn Jenner is a man with a mental disorder That must mean his ideas are so idiotic he must not be allowed to campus Why is it so foreign when this idea of men and women being different seemed normal  years ago You can see how I feel but I think the more important point is the denial of ideas statistics or speech which can be on either side is so core to the way people think PERIOD Ben Shapiro offers answers to many of these criticisms at least and if you cant see that as valuable in a speaker thats sad PERIOD Furthermore in World War II kids were drafted and blown up before they even hit the machinge gun fire beaches in Normandy PERIOD Jenner is living a rich posh life and being applauded for having to elect to identify as a woman PERIOD What is real courage I see it in the people that fought against the real Nazis the left hates PERIOD

JerBo									  									Sep   at  pm

amen

Aaron McDonald									  									Sep   at  pm

Connor censorship is not an effective means of defeating ideas you deem dangerous PERIOD  If Bens ideas have little intellectual merit then confront him on intellectual grounds PERIOD  Ben allows all those who disagree with him to ask questions and challenge him before those who agree with him are allowed to ask him questions PERIOD  And he wont talk over you PERIOD  So I fully anticipate you participating in the event and challenging him directly during the QA PERIOD

Also if a campus group wanted to host an outspoken neonazi speaker or an active member of the KKK or a leader of any other abhorrent group your assertion that this would be harmful to the campus is unfounded PERIOD I have no doubt that the student body would challenge such a speakers ideas and be entirely capable of putting those ideas in their place the intellectual garbage bin PERIOD  In fact I believe the campus would become stronger and more unified in opposing actual hate if such a speaker were given a platform PERIOD  While if a student group was denied that opportunity then people are left wondering why someones words and ideas are forbidden and those same ideas become more seductive than they would otherwise PERIOD  The irony of censorship is that it only proves to promote whats censored PERIOD

Jordan C PERIOD									  									Sep   at  pm

Mr PERIOD Richards has committed the same act that far left groups like Antifa are committing that is painting someone as inhuman with labels like Nazi and KKK as a means to justify any act against them PERIOD They justify physical violence against someone if that individual is painted as a Nazi PERIOD They justify burning down a campus if a campus visitor is painted as altright PERIOD Finally they justify the cancellation of an event if the speakers rhetoric is painted as hate speech PERIOD Their goal has transitioned from intellectual thoughtful debate to immediate suppression through character assassination PERIOD The truth is Mr PERIOD Richards the individual has rights and those rights do not end where your opinions begin PERIOD Anyone can label any event seminar topic or discussion as hateful PERIOD If hypothetically I so chose would my labeling of this article as hateful against Shapiro with the use of terms like coward justify the removal of it The answer is a resounding no PERIOD

Chris Anderson									  									Sep   at  pm

Believing that universities exist to promote productive ideas is to surrender your intellectual honesty PERIOD Who decides which ideas are productive Apparently Mr PERIOD Richards would prefer that a panel of administrators declare which ideas are productive and which shall be banned PERIOD Universities do in fact exist as a freeforall forum for all ideas to be debated and refined through public discourse and argument PERIOD If an idea is not worth defending in the public square it is not worth holding PERIOD Should you take issue with an idea being presented the onus is on you to dispute it PERIOD Mr PERIOD Richards has failed to do this dismissing Mr PERIOD Shapiro as cowardly and xenophobic rather than engaging honestly with his arguments PERIOD Cancelling his appearance as many other institutions have done would be a grave disservice to the students and the larger community PERIOD Dismissing an argument or a speaker outofhand teaches you nothing of their faults and leaves you blind to their merits PERIOD

Donald Aguirre									  									Sep   at  pm

Shapiro is being lumped into the same category as Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer which is hilarious because hes not a troll and a practicing Jew PERIOD  Im a liberal and have arrived to the conclusion that the main reason hes being protested is because people disagree with him PERIOD  This nonsense of hate speech needs to stop PERIOD  The Supreme Court ruled in June yet again that even speech you disagree with hate speech in this case is protected under the FA PERIOD  I wont cling to the blanket that is the constitution but has anyone given thought to the precedent that it would set if a conservative speaker were blocked  Would it be OK then if liberal speakers were refused a space to hold their event simply because a conservative took issue with it  If you dont care about this youre living in the wrong country PERIOD  Shapiro is a prominent figure in conservative politics he was invited by a student group and the U is doing the right thing by allowing him to have his event PERIOD  Ill be going to this event not because I agree with him I dont in most cases but because higher learning is a battleground of ideas and as stated in this piece by Clark When you listen to people you disagree with you can gain a better understanding of their argument why they think that way how they came to that conclusion PERIOD If you can do that not only can you broaden your overall understanding of a subject but you can adopt new views or harden your own

Donald thank you for renewing my faith in the human ability to objectively examine information PERIOD   Recently a student asked the professor for a few minutes at the beginning of class to announce the protest her affiliate group was sponsoring against Shapiro being allowed to speak at the U and to passed out a flier for anyone interested to join their protest PERIOD  While I applaud and support her passion and desire to have her voice heard the intensity of her bias concerned me PERIOD  I refrained from commenting knowing that to do so would spark a heated conversation in classa conversation I would have welcomed but may have disrespected the professors allotted time to teach PERIOD  After class not surprisingly this student captured me in a discussion PERIOD  I expressed to her how much I valued the freedom of speech this country has fought so valiantly for as suspected she got pretty heated that I disagreed with the Universitys stance to protect freedom of speech she equated my desire to protect freedom of speech with supporting Hitlers murderous rampage for world dominance PERIOD I was at first offended by her logic as I have a few years on her and have spent years studying such oppressive regimes and conflicts such as Hitler Stalin Mao Korea Vietnam Rwandas genocide of the Tutsi community etc PERIOD  I have walked on the soil of many of these countries walked through museums burial grounds seeking to gain understanding to honor and never forget the victims caught in the crossfires of such atrocities PERIOD  However instead of matching her antagonism I reaffirmed my respect for her convictions in bringing awareness to others as I now felt I had an obligation to investigate Shapiros point of views PERIOD  Higher learning is a battleground of ideas broadening my understanding of the world at large PERIOD

Respectfully Mr PERIOD Richards would do well to note that the suppression of any ideological platformyes even Holocaust denial alchemy or crazy conspiracy theoriesis a refusal to listen PERIOD If Ben Shapiros ideas are dangerous then we ought to be evaluating them carefully in order finely to tune better ideas against his PERIOD A placard reading No hate speech inhibits accomplishing this and calling a person hateful on the basis of a politicocultural ethos is hardly convincing as an argument PERIOD One wonders why hateful is a criterion for incredibility anyway PERIOD

It seems that Connor Richards has shown a tremendous amount of misunderstanding and lack of analysis on the suggested policies that Shapiro has espoused PERIOD If Richard has considered Shapiros thoughts a little more critically instead of dismissing him as a coward he would certainly find that Shapiros conservatism is frankly unremarkable he just simply defends his points very well as noted by Coleman PERIOD Richards argument are full of slippery slope fallacies including thinking that conservative thought is almost as equivalent as holocaust denial PERIOD Colemans take on the Shapiro speech shows far more consideration while Richards opinion seems very haphazard and lazy PERIOD
