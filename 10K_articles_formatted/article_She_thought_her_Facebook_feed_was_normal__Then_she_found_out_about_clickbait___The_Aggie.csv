Although mostly harmless clickbait can have negative political and social repercussions

Clickbait is one of the most pervasive and hardtoignore features of the Internet in the twenty-first century PERIOD It undoubtedly plays an important role in how people perceive the world politically economically socially racially and religiously PERIOD The early days of Internet grappled with spam  Viagra advertisements miracle beauty cures fake lottery wins  but today such ads encompass only a small portion of the material that Internet users are exposed to on a daily basis PERIOD

For example when I first began using Facebook as a 15yearold in  I was puzzled by the nearconstant flow of Tampax commercials American Apparel ads psychological horror stories crisis hotline numbers and unsolicited beauty advice columns that were constantly appearing on my feed PERIOD Then I understood Just as a middleaged woman using Facebook might be exposed to ads advertising dating sites for hot single men over  my Facebook page was feeding me commercials and information that they thought I would find interesting PERIOD Aside from finding this utterly depressing  teenage girls believe it or not have more to think about than feminine hygiene and whether or not their summer body is bikiniready  I also found it irritating and insulting PERIOD I was going through a particularly selfconscious phase of my life so Im certain that the impact of such clickbait registered much more sharply than it would now PERIOD I remember realizing that I would never really be free someone somewhere would always be trying to tell me what to do how to look how to act PERIOD Even the Internet had it in for me PERIOD

I also noticed that my Facebook feed was providing me with a particularly apocalyptic world view PERIOD If I had decided not to use the manage my ads feature I may have been inclined to fall into the negative vortex of information that claimed that as a teenage girl in the 14to18 age group I would likely experience unprecedented anxiety love problems beauty worries and reproductive crises on a neardaily basis PERIOD Evidently womanhood was even more fraught with danger than I had anticipated PERIOD Nevertheless I believed that in managing my ads I would be immune to the clickbait that tailed me on social media and in my Internet searches PERIOD This of course is not so PERIOD

As a college student I engage in brainless Internet surfing fairly often PERIOD Its a way to relax I tell myself a way to escape the daily drudgery of the trending news cycle that haunts my iPhone day in and day out PERIOD I will even confess that in addition to reading The New York Times and The Washington Post to assure myself that Im still an informed upright citizen with a balanced view of the world I have religiously followed the details of the upcoming royal wedding PERIOD I have fallen prey to articles citing Ten Times Meghan Markle was a Total Boss Ten Times Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were Totally Cute and What Meghan Markle Looked Like Before She was Famous. i cant help it PERIOD Markle may finally be able to redeem the whole abdicationWallisSimpsonfiasco that shook the English monarchy to its core in the 1930s PERIOD A divorced biracial Catholicschooleducated American actress is marrying into the notoriously stuffy House of Windsor PERIOD Can you blame me for enjoying it Nevertheless Ive begun to notice that the Markle thread is following me PERIOD Her muchsoughtafter Everlane bag rumored to have broken the Internet has appeared on my feed as have endless top ten lists featuring beauty and fashion candids PERIOD Its beginning to feel a little strange PERIOD It appears that Im still after all a victim of clickbait PERIOD

Naturally such articles are harmless enough PERIOD Im old enough to distinguish between reality and fantasy truth and nonsense  or so I tell myself PERIOD However clickbait can still have negative repercussions PERIOD As I wrote about in my previous column clickbait and trending features are not limited just to product histories PERIOD They can be political contributing to a narrow and isolationist worldview that is becoming increasingly hard to fight in this era of social economic and ideological polarization PERIOD They can be psychological convincing you that youre on the verge of a nervous breakdown that you may benefit from Adderall PERIOD And they can be social PERIOD Here you are sitting in your dorm room while everyone else is out having a good time PERIOD Everyone else is more fashionable more politically aware than you are PERIOD Have you seen these new sneakers Have you watched Childish Gambinos This is America video Moreover have you finally copped on to the fact that Childish Gambino and Donald Glover are the same person Have you registered to vote Get with it Rebecca PERIOD
