Clothing and style are very important elements in most peoples lives PERIOD In recent years with worries about the environment coming to the forefront of peoples minds there has been a push to cut down on the massive waste that industries like the fashion industry create PERIOD Many people advocate for thrifting clothes instead of buying brand new ones in order to be more sustainable save money and find unique options PERIOD Thrifting while incredibly popular and a good way to buy new clothes is not the only option for sustainable fashion PERIOD Repurposing ones old clothing is another great way to engage in sustainability not to mention the money it saves and the creativity it allows for PERIOD Clothing items that are worn in some spots are out of date or do not fit right do not have to be thrown out PERIOD Repurposing these items is a great and engaging project to take on while social distancing PERIOD

Clothing is surprisingly easy to change into different and updated items PERIOD Collegian news editor Jasper Jones  said Ill make different shirts or sometimes dresses into crop tops while Cristina Chapa  said I made a headband out of an old tshirt. another classic and easy revamp is to cut jeans into shorts PERIOD All these ideas are simple and accessible ways to reuse clothing fixes like these often cost nothing and only require tools such as a pair of scissors a needle and thread or a sewing machine if you have one PERIOD

There is a chain of sustainable actions that happen when something is reused and looked at in a new way PERIOD When revamping an item you already own you dont use gas to travel to a store you help limit the necessary production of clothing and you are responsible for less garbage thrown into landfills PERIOD

Bee Heumann  said It helps reduce waste and makes me less likely to buy more clothes that will then just become waste again. in an Instagram poll of  people  percent claimed that they restyle or reuse their old clothing PERIOD When this mindset is exercised by many people the human imprint on the earth lessens due to lowered demand for production PERIOD

Aside from the environmental benefits of repurposing an item it also offers a creative project and allows you to keep clothing you may be attached to PERIOD Heumann explained that sometimes she repurposes items because she does not want to get rid of things saying I get attached to certain articles of clothing and dont want to lose them just because they got stretched out or got holes. many people experience similar emotions in relation to their clothes and can forget about the possibilities of simply transforming them PERIOD

As social distancing takes its toll and people begin to complain of boredom revamping some clothes can be a fun way to fill time PERIOD Not only that but with clothing stores closed this offers an alternative to shopping for new clothing PERIOD Experimenting with clothing that is already destined for the trash on its own cannot ruin anything and may yield a surprisingly rewarding result PERIOD

Repurposing clothing allows one to express their creativity while on a college students budget PERIOD It is something that can always be done at home during your spare time PERIOD While the world practices social distancing repurposing clothing can be one way to spend time in a productive and ecofriendly way PERIOD
