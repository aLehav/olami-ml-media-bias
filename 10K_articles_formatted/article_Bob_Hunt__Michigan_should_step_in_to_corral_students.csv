One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

The Wave PERIOD Its a Michigan football
tradition like The Victors or the Go
Blue banner PERIOD It also represents the state of the Michigan
football student section PERIOD In the third quarter of Michigans
game against San Diego State fans in the front row of the student
section led the students in waving their hands in the air with
little regard to the play on the field PERIOD

But there was one small problem PERIOD The Aztecs were down just three
and driving in an attempt to tie or take the lead and the students
leading the cheers didnt really seem to care PERIOD They were like
the guys you see behind a backstop at a baseball game talking on a
cell phone telling their buddies that theyre on TV PERIOD

Although the upperclassmen stopped attempts at the wave last
week against Iowa there is still a severe lack of coordination
that makes the Michigan student football experience less than what
it could be PERIOD Thousands of students may comprise the student
section but the only connection they have with one another is that
they attend the University PERIOD

The common bond stops there as everyone seems to have their own
way of cheering PERIOD Some people like to do the chop after third down PERIOD
Others like to do the claw PERIOD Some people like to wave their hand and
yell with the band PERIOD Others like to talk on their cell phone and
tell the rowdy students behind them to be quiet PERIOD

Many have tried to unify the student section and for the most
part have failed PERIOD Student groups made and sold Blue
Out and Maize Out make up your mind
Tshirts after seeing similar things done at other schools PERIOD Other
individuals have attempted to bring signs getting those around them
to follow their lead PERIOD This past week the Michigan cheerleaders
passed out yellow sheets of paper to some students asking them to
become the twelfth man on the field. one endeavor that has been a success depending on who you ask
was the implementation of The Claw. although some had
previously done The Claw supposed to represent the
ferociousness of the Wolverine as an alternative to The
Chop supposed to mock the first down that the opposing team
failed to achieve the increased awareness last year was like
throwing a match in an oil spill PERIOD Now The Chop seems
to be upon its dying days PERIOD

But situations such as that one are few and far between PERIOD The
reality is that without the support of the athletic department
the Michigan student section will never be nearly as unified as it
is at other schools nor will the Big House have the atmosphere it
is capable of PERIOD

One place on campus where the atmosphere has improved
tremendously is at Crisler Arena thanks to the Maize Rage PERIOD A place
almost devoid of student involvement during the Fab Five era could
have one of its best seasons yet this year ticket applications are
due today PERIOD Now students meet each Monday with the hopes of making
Crisler Arena as unwelcoming as possible PERIOD

As anyone whose sat in the bleachers at a basketball game knows
they make a newsletter for each game titled Full Court
Press that gives the students direction on what cheers to
say when PERIOD

Ryan Shinska Superfan V and head of the Maize Rage said that
the group has tried to crossover its efforts to football but the
immense size of the student section has prevented it from making
any headway PERIOD

With  students its a lot harder to do as
opposed to  students for basketball this year Shinska
said PERIOD

Ideas to improve the student section have been bantered around
such as starting games later in the day or allowing students to
enter the section in a first come first serve basis PERIOD But the
athletic department would likely never allow a night game and the
way Michigan Stadium is set up would make freeforall seating a
recipe for lawsuits PERIOD

One initiative the athletic department should take is to help
create a group like the Maize Rage for football that could devise
and lead cheers from the start of the section and coordinate
cheering with the band and cheerleaders PERIOD

Michigan State has a similar organization called the Corner
Blitz run by the MSU Student Alumni Foundation which also runs the
Izzone that swarms the Breslin Center during each Spartan
basketball game PERIOD Members of the Corner Blitz wear special Tshirts
and sit in a separate section from the rest of the students while
leading various cheers PERIOD The organization has grown in recent years
and now has over  members PERIOD Dave Jackson Corner Blitz
codirector says that the major success of the group comes from
the support it receives from everyone involved  from coach
John L PERIOD Smith to the band PERIOD

If everyone wants it to happen it can happen
Jackson said PERIOD

While a completely separate section may never exist in Ann
Arbor a group could still create creative cheers and get the band
cheerleaders and the students on the same page PERIOD The group could
also help put more emphasis on cheering on the team instead of
doing the wave during a key third down play PERIOD

But the first step that would have to be taken is the
realization by many that Michigan Stadium could be and needs to
be a better place to watch a football game PERIOD Watching the Notre
Dame student section a couple weeks ago I was amazed by the
unification of the students  they had a ritual for every
part of the game PERIOD

Since Notre Dame is a small private school itll be
difficult to emulate that enviroment PERIOD But that does not mean that
Michigan cannot and should not improve PERIOD

For a school with the academic and athletic reputation of
Michigan one should expect so much more PERIOD

Bob Hunt thinks that Michigan students should emulate German
soccer hooligans and light fires in the stands after each
touchdown PERIOD He can be reached at
