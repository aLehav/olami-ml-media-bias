We write to respond to recent commentary published in The MaroonNews regarding medication abortion access on campus PERIOD Student Health Services met with student leaders from Planned Parenthood of Colgate in February of this year to start a conversation about medication abortion PERIOD The conclusion of that discussion was to keep an open dialogue bring forth any new information or data and to consider bringing a provider from Planned Parenthood to campus to discuss medication abortion and related considerations of this care PERIOD

Unfortunately there have been no further conversations with Student Health Services surrounding this issue PERIOD SHS has not been invited to any further meetings of Planned Parenthood of Colgate the CU Collective or any other discussions regarding medication abortions that have occurred on campus PERIOD

Student Health Services SHS has a long history of providing expansive reproductive health services and provides unbiased pregnancy options counseling and maintains a referral network for abortion services PERIOD SHS partners with several specialty medical providers for services that we are unable to offer within our clinic PERIOD This referral network includes reproductivehealthcare providers endocrinologists and orthopedists within our region PERIOD As The MaroonNews commentary noted SHS does refer students seeking abortion to a provider in the Binghamton area PERIOD We also offer referrals to Planned Parenthood in Utica approximately  minutes away as well as Planned Parenthood in Syracuse approximately  minutes away PERIOD

While these distances are a reality of healthcare in rural America our nearby options are far closer than those afforded to students in many states PERIOD Although not by design accessing healthcare or treatment requires taking time away from ones other responsibilities and obligations this is no more true at Colgate than it will be following graduation PERIOD Student Health Services goal is to make accessing healthcare as easy as possible for every student however it will necessarily always require time and effort PERIOD

Providing medication abortion services requires providing 24hour oncall access to specialized and emergency care PERIOD Unlike some institutions in larger metropolitan areas Colgate does not have access to local emergency obstetricians or gynecologists within Hamilton PERIOD Medication abortion a specialized treatment option exceeds what Student Health Services is able to safely provide PERIOD While complications of medication abortion treatment are rare they can occur and require emergencylevel services PERIOD Although not required as a private institution Colgates practice of offering referrals to authorized prescribers of medication abortion treatment is in alignment with new legislation governing New Yorks public university system PERIOD

There are no additional charges for a consultation or treatments at Student Health Services PERIOD The only charges passed on to students are the cost for tests or medications provided at the time of the visit because SHS does not bill insurances PERIOD

Most importantly I want every student to know that SHS is here to support you PERIOD We are an exceptional healthcare resource for students and we are fortunate to have many highquality healthcare providers and partners to help offer a comprehensive lineup of services even when students healthcare needs exceed that of what is locally available within SHS or Community Memorial Hospital PERIOD
