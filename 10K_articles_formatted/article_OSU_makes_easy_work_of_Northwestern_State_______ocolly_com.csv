The Oklahoma State mens basketball team took the floor against Northwestern La. state on a sleepy Sunday afternoon PERIOD It remained a sleepy afternoon as the Cowboys cruised to an easy  win over the Demons PERIOD OSU used a strong defensive first half to establish a comfortable 19point lead PERIOD The Cowboys had  steals in the game while committing  turnovers against an NWSU  team made up of  freshmen PERIOD



Through the last two games it could be said that the Cowboys  are playing to the level of their competition PERIOD In OSUs last game against Hartford the Cowboys won  but lacked a killer instinct that would have blown out Hartford and NWSU PERIOD



 said OSU point guard Victor Williams PERIOD Thats kind of been something for the last few years thats been haunting us  that we have  solid minutes then we have  minutes where we dont play too well PERIOD Weve got to eliminate that to be a good team.In the first half I thought we played OKI thought our offense was all right PERIOD We missed shots but our defense was terrific and overall it was a very good first  minutes PERIOD







The leading scorer for OSU was Melvin Sanders with  points PERIOD Just behind Sanders was Tony Allen with  points and five rebounds Williams with  points and Ivan McFarlin who had  points and four rebounds PERIOD



Playing against smaller nonconference opponents gives the Cowboys a better chance at winning PERIOD The problem lies in that many teams play a lackluster second half after being up by so many points PERIOD



 said Sutton PERIOD Through the years weve done a pretty good job of not doing that but we certainly have let it happen the last two games.Im glad we dont have conference for a monthI wish we had two months but I think all of the games that are upcoming will be a lot better test than what weve seen other than two of the games in Alaska PERIOD







Easily the high point of the afternoon came when with  left in the game Victor Williams drove into the paint and dished the ball quickly to Frans Steyn PERIOD The fanfavorite Steyn brought the ball down for a slam that made the few people left in GallagherIba Arena sound like the place was full PERIOD



Through the first few games of the season each time Steyn steps into the game or handles the ball there is a buzz in the crowd PERIOD Seeing Steyn develop in the upcoming years is something that many look forward to PERIOD



 said Williams of the crowd PERIOD To see the reaction from the crowd like that can only make you want to go a little harder and get a little better so I think youll see a lot out of him in the next three or four years. brad Blood can be
