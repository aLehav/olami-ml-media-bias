9579,2018-02-05,"reading is one of the most important skills to have and develop in life PERIOD However people dont seem to be reading for fun as much as they could be and this needs to be changed PERIOD

Along with the obvious benefits that come with reading for pleasure such as increased intelligence and openmindedness it can also improve stress levels curb anxiety and depression PERIOD

In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center around  percent of adults said they hadnt read a whole book whether electronic audio or print within  months PERIOD With multiple assignments due and the amounts of pages to read for class its hard to think about ever reading a book for fun PERIOD During high school required reading becomes much more common and therefore becomes a chore to many students turning them away from reading books in their free time PERIOD This shouldnt be the case because of how important reading becomes in adult life PERIOD

For UTD students reading becomes especially important PERIOD Think about those journal articles textbook pages and lab reports you read for your classes PERIOD Then think about having to analyze them to be able to write 10page essays and dissertations PERIOD While reading more books seems like the last thing on your mind it can be a fun way to train yourself to read faster and comprehend difficult texts more efficiently PERIOD

One of the most often mentioned benefits of reading is its effect on the brain itself PERIOD In Anne E PERIOD Cunninghams article What Reading Does for the Mind it cites that those who read frequently form enhanced vocabulary and verbal skills PERIOD Even if a person reads slowly or cannot easily read complex literature the effort to read often at all contributes to increased intelligence PERIOD Additionally avid readers develop advanced writing skills by observing other writing styles through their readings and applying those to their own works PERIOD Its obvious that reading in ones free time no matter the genre develops higher intelligence PERIOD

Reading books teaches life lessons and put readers in situations they may not ever get to experience PERIOD Most of the Harry Potter series stands in Amazons Top  bestselling kids and teen books of all time among other books such as The Fault in Our Stars and The Book Thief. although these vastly differ in genre they teach readers life lessons and how to deal with difficult situations such as death disease and depression PERIOD A research article published by the Public Library of Science titled How Does Fiction Reading Influence Empathy An Experimental Investigation on the Role of Emotional Transportation suggests that when a reader feels sympathy for a book character they turn to their own selfconcept of who they want to be and take the perspective of others which in turn develops empathy in real life PERIOD When reading about the death of a parent or a loved one a person can either relate to their own experiences or those of a friend and that is how empathy develops PERIOD

The same concept applies to how reading improves relationships and opens the mind to different cultures and backgrounds PERIOD The book Wonder by R.J PERIOD Palacio provides readers with a firstperson perspective of a child with a facial deformity and readers then learn how to treat people who look differently PERIOD While these situations may be uncomfortable to a reader it forces them to consider outlooks different from their own and how to apply them to real life PERIOD Thus reading improves empathy and social relationships by applying situations in books to reality PERIOD

Books also help with anxiety stress relief and can be used as a form of therapy PERIOD In a study conducted at the University of Sussex researchers increased test subjects heart rates and stress levels through a variety of tests and exercises and then were run through various traditional relaxation methods and reading for six minutes reduced up to  percent of stress levels PERIOD Losing yourself in a book takes away stress because of the concentration required to read PERIOD Bibliotherapy an increasingly common way to treat anxiety and depression incorporates evaluation of ones own problems and life through reading PERIOD The School of Life in London includes bibliotherapy as a treatment method where patients are prescribed a list of books meant to inspire and comfort PERIOD Reading books in ones free time can contribute to lower stress levels and an overall improved state of mind PERIOD

Despite the benefits to ones mind character and health people still dont read as much as they could PERIOD One of the most common excuses to not read is usually I just dont have time to read. making time to read is the same as making time to scroll through your Instagram feed or read Buzzfeed articles PERIOD Reading doesnt have to be a chore and you can even read for as little as  minutes a day PERIOD You can read when youre eating breakfast when youre waiting for the bus when youre waiting for class to start or even when youre standing in line for lunch PERIOD In those times when were mindlessly scrolling through our Snapchat stories out of boredom there are easy opportunities to be reading PERIOD In the end if youre stressed tired bored overwhelmed want to escape your responsibilities or all of the above your solution is right there in the pages of a book PERIOD
