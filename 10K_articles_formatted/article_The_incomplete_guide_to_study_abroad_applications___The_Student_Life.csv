Study abroad application deadlines for next fall are coming up very soon for some of you a bit more in the future for others PERIOD If youre thinking about studying abroad next fall  or next spring for that matter  and you dont know when the deadline is check now PERIOD Thats my first piece of advice PERIOD

Applying can be stressful but this list of tips tricks and advice pulled from my own experience applying for my program and my friends experiences to a more limited extent will hopefully help ease the way PERIOD

I started looking at study abroad programs more than a year before I was scheduled to leave during the summer before my sophomore year PERIOD This was probably too early but I was glad to have had a tentative idea of where I wanted to apply before the stress of school began anew PERIOD

Looking at my application well ahead of time also helped me begin to think about and plan what I wanted to write for my essays PERIOD For Pomona I had two totaling around  words PERIOD

Having a rough idea of my plans also allowed me to sign up for an appointment with the Pomona study abroad office just after they opened up before the office was completely booked PERIOD

Starting early also gave me a chance to ask the professors who I wanted to write my recommendations early giving them plenty of time to complete them without rushing PERIOD If youre applying for study abroad next year start thinking now about which professors you think might write the best recommendations for you and ask them sooner rather than later PERIOD

If you are planning on applying to a program that your school has not preapproved you will face an earlier petition deadline so starting in advance will be particularly helpful PERIOD That said if you have not yet started your application for next fall it may not be too late depending on your schools deadline PERIOD Get started as soon as you can PERIOD

Talk to as many people as you can about the program PERIOD Talk to your study abroad office talk to representatives from the program do research about the program and your host city and most importantly talk to people who have previously been on the program especially those who have been recently PERIOD

Talking to a Pomona student who had previously attended the program was a critical factor in my choice of where to go PERIOD Hearing about her best experiences and memories from the program  as well as the low points and her dislikes  helped me make my decision PERIOD

Students will also be your best resource for knowing whether there are hidden problems with prospective programs which may steer you away from those and push you to find other options PERIOD

When choosing your program think about what your goals and interests are PERIOD Are you looking to practice a language Explore a foreign culture Experience a different learning environment There are a multitude of programs available and being aware of your specific goals can help you decide on one PERIOD

I had studied abroad during summer programs in Spanishspeaking countries and have studied Spanish since second grade but was looking for a different experience for my semester abroad PERIOD For this reason  and others  I settled on an English language program focusing intently on my major international relations rather than one in Spanish with a broader range of courses available PERIOD

Some programs particularly language programs will have some prerequisites PERIOD Another reason I chose not to sign up for some of the preapproved Spanish language programs is that I did not plan to take a Spanish course last spring which the programs required PERIOD

Although course selection has already occurred if you are planning on studying abroad next fall and have not done so yet check to see whether there are any course perquisites you need to fulfill PERIOD It may not be too late to PERM into a class that fulfills requirements PERIOD

As someone who applied to about  colleges and around  separate internship positions last summer I was stressed when I found out that Pomona would only allow me to apply to one study abroad program per semester PERIOD Although some of the 5Cs allow students to apply to more than one program many keep the number very low PERIOD

If you are like me you might be nervous about this but you really shouldnt be PERIOD Especially for school approved programs barring any significant issues with your GPA or disciplinary record you will likely be admitted to your program of choice with little issue PERIOD I have not spoken to anyone at the 5Cs who was rejected from a program they applied to PERIOD If your study abroad office says you dont need a backup then you dont PERIOD

Pomonas application was also much more stringent than my programs PERIOD Pomonas application involved several essays and indepth questions PERIOD My program required me to do little more than fill in my GPA upload my transcript and provide other personal details PERIOD

However much paperwork youre expecting expect more PERIOD Study abroad requires massive amounts of paperwork health forms academic planning forms course approval forms housing forms visa forms in some cases and more PERIOD And after youre accepted theres more still PERIOD

The best way to handle the paperwork is to make sure youre staying aware of the due dates for each form what you need to do to and who you need to contact to complete them PERIOD

Although I am only studying abroad for one semester some friends will be abroad this spring as well PERIOD I have heard from them that this requires meetings with the study abroad office more advanced planning to complete spring applications while abroad and forms that need to be completed before you leave PERIOD

Study abroad involves a lot of preparation but it all pays off in the end PERIOD You will get into your program and get to go abroad so get excited
