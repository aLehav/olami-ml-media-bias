Last week The Standard failed PERIOD

Homecoming Blackout was an incredibly important event one that has affected everyone at MSU and everyone who attends this university needs to know about it PERIOD

So where was The Standard that Saturday afternoon

Thats the question people keep asking me and rightfully so PERIOD

The answer is that we failed as the campus source for news PERIOD I was personally informed about the protests made the assumption that they were similar to the Ferguson protests that we had already covered earlier and decided not to assign coverage PERIOD

This was an indefensible error PERIOD Im not going to make excuses and neither is anyone else at The Standard PERIOD Were going to work to get better and were going to make sure everyone knows about the Homecoming Blackout and the surrounding issues PERIOD

I know a lot of people like me have mistakenly thought this protest was directly related to Ferguson PERIOD Thats simply not true  it was about black rights as a whole PERIOD

If were not paying attention enough to understand the basic message of the protest how can we be expected to join in the conversation

On that note Id like to acknowledge The Black Bear a new studentrun site that did have reporters there and has been covering Homecoming Blackout since day one PERIOD

Read my article this week over Homecoming Blackout PERIOD Read The Black Bears coverage of it PERIOD Go to the Speak Up event Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD in Carrington Hall PERIOD Be informed PERIOD Be engaged PERIOD

This is a conversation that we all need to be having PERIOD Dont stand on the sidelines PERIOD MSU will never change for the better if you do PERIOD
