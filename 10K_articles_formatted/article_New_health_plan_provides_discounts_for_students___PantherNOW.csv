A discount health care plan with provisions for dental vision and pharmacy services was approved in early April by FIUs administration and is now available to all FIU students PERIOD

International students who are mandated by Federal law to have health insurance brought concerns for a better cheaper solution to health care to former Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council President Adrian Carter PERIOD A solution arose in late fall when Student Government Association approved the CoHealth Group Collegiate Plan PERIOD

Initially the plan was meant to target  international students who did not have dental and vision care options readily accessible but it is available to the entire student body PERIOD

In state residents have access to insurance PERIOD  Their parents are here they probably have coverage with their parents Carter said PERIOD  But the additional bonus of this plan is that it will benefit every student. the CoHealth Group Collegiate Plan was developed by CoHealth a company that offers discounts to its members for a variety of medical services PERIOD  The Collegiate plan was created specifically in order to meet the financial needs of college and university students many of whom cannot afford traditional health insurance PERIOD

According to the CoHealth Group Collegiate Plans brochure the benefits of the plan will enable students to save up to  percent when obtaining dental vision andor pharmacy services PERIOD

There is an annual membership fee for each of the three plans  ranging from  to  PERIOD  Students can save more money by enrolling in all three plans  dental pharmacy and vision for an annual fee of  PERIOD  Family packages are also available PERIOD

The major differences between this plan and traditional health insurance is that savings are more immediate the brochure promises that students who enroll wont have to worry about age restrictions deductions and maximums or filling out claims forms PERIOD  Under the plan students are also able to utilize health services that might not be reimbursable by an insurance company PERIOD

The plan is not insurance said Ana Sippin FIUs director of International Student and Scholar Services PERIOD  It is a membership that makes dental vision and pharmacy services cost effective for students PERIOD  It is a reduced cost option. this membership plan does not conflict with any forms of health insurance and there are over  participating providers nationwide PERIOD  It may be used at FIU and throughout the United States PERIOD

The plan makes dental vision and pharmacy services one more thing for which we do not have to pay fullprice said junior and Humanities major Jennifer Samson PERIOD  The plan is necessary because it gives us more options PERIOD  The more options the better. once enrolled as a single student or family members can go to any of the professional providers who have agreed to provide their products and services at a discount PERIOD

The plan received overwhelming support and is a big accomplishment for the Student Government Association Carter said PERIOD
