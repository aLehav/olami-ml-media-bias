2873,2004-11-18,"after a successful campaign for Wisconsin in  under head coach Bo Ryan the mens basketball team prepares for yet another rigorous season of Big Ten basketball PERIOD Last season Ryans third at the helm Wisconsin closed the season with  wins breaking the record set the previous year and subsequently captured the first Big Ten Tournament title for the first time in school history PERIOD

Since then however the Badgers have experienced a vicious series of ups and downs PERIOD For starters standout pointman Devin Harris earned recognition as Big Ten Player of the Year the first badger since  to garner that honor after breaking the season points record set by pro star Michael Finley in  PERIOD Just months later Harris announced his intention to forego another year at Wisconsin to enter the NBA draft PERIOD

Wisconsin easily earned its seventh consecutive bid to play in the NCAA Tournament yet failed to advance to the Sweet  after suffering a hard fought loss to Pittsburgh in the second round PERIOD

Finally with the emergence of thensophomore guard Boo Wade backing up Harris at the one spot it seemed the Badgers had a replacement candidate for the  season adept at running the point and defending the perimeter PERIOD Then for reasons still largely unknown Ryan announced in late October that Wade would take an indefinite leave of absence from the squad PERIOD

As Wisconsin looks to overcome the loss of one of the most valuable players in college hoops there will be voids to fill not only at the point guard position but also in terms of finding a goto playmaker and a leader both on and off the court PERIOD

Losing a guy like Devin its always hard to replace  he brings so much to the table senior forward Mike Wilkinson said PERIOD But its not crucial to have a guy like him to make your offense go PERIOD We have so many weapons that we can put on the floor that can make a difference and we have so many guys to fill in at that point guard spot who can really play basketball. with Wade out of the picture for the time being the focus shifts to three prospects sophomore Kammron Taylor senior Sharif Chambliss and freshman Michael Flowers PERIOD

We never talk about replacing we talk about opportunities Ryan said PERIOD This is going to create opportunities for probably a couple people because were going to have two or three guys probably before the season is over playing some of the one spot. after leading the ramshackle Nittany Lions in scoring both his sophomore and junior year its been a rocky road to the cardinal and white for Chambliss PERIOD Due to NCAA transfer rules the Racine Wis. native lost his basketball scholarship in the move and was forced to redshirt the entire  season PERIOD To make matters worse Chambliss injured his right ACL in the second to last practice of the spring PERIOD

Its feeling pretty good right now Chambliss said PERIOD Weve got a lot of guys coming off injuries so we all support each other PERIOD Its helped a lot with being able to get out on the floor. generally considered a perimeter shooter at Penn State running the point presents Chambliss with a new challenge PERIOD For the inexperienced Taylor and Flowers adapting their game to fill a prominent role on a Big Ten backcourt remains a challenge upon itself PERIOD With the Badgers nonconference schedule almost underway all eyes focus on the three guards battling for playing time on the squad PERIOD

Nobody has a locked position on the floor Taylor said PERIOD Everybodys just going out and playing hard PERIOD I know people around the country like to put an emphasis on the battle of the point guards but were teammates were just going out there and trying to make each other better. breaking from the recent trend the Badger frontcourt constitutes the strength of the squad in Ryans fourth year PERIOD After missing virtually all of last season due to injury athletic sophomore forward Alando Tucker made his return to the court against UWParkside Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Tuckers strength inside and towering vertical leap provide the Badgers with an explosive presence up front PERIOD

Tucker spent much of the offseason increasing his tempo by going oneonone with the fleet footed Kammron Taylor PERIOD

Ive been working on getting my shot quicker Tucker said PERIOD My release has to be a lot quicker than when Im playing the four because guys are quicker with their feet PERIOD But it also gives me an advantage PERIOD After playing in the post for a year I actually can post up the smaller guys and use my strength. returning senior forward Mike Wilkinson and keynote contributor Zach Morley join Tucker up front PERIOD Wilkinson averaged . points and . rebounds per game last season with Morley chipping in . and . in a supporting role PERIOD Former firstteam Parade AllAmerican Brian Butch should also see considerable time after redshirting in  PERIOD

Butch came in highly ranked by a lot of people but just wasnt physically or mentally ready for that next step Wilkinson said PERIOD Ive talked with him a lot and hes really come to understand a lot more about basketball and become a more complete player taking this time off PERIOD He has a chance to become something really special and hes taking full advantage of it. though the departure of Harris left a gaping hole on the Badger roster the team feels they have the talent to compensate for his productivity at both ends of the court PERIOD As far as appointing a new leader Tucker asserts he and Chambliss will take up the reins vocally with Wilkinson leading more by example PERIOD

A strong part of our team has always been leadership Wilkinson said PERIOD I think even when Devin was here we still had guys that were considered leaders on the side PERIOD Devin was the most obvious one but there were always guys in the background that if Devin wasnt on the court there were guys out there that guys could look to. this article was published Nov   at  am and last
