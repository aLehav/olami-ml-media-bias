Spring lies just around the frigid corner and like the coming flowers many Bearcats are considering their next bloom PERIOD Some believe deliverance lurks within the Sparks fitness complex PERIOD However the frosts of self doubt and lack of understanding stifle many athletic buds before they can begin to open PERIOD Thus I offer the following guide to alleviate some of the mystery and fear which surrounds the Lestle J PERIOD Sparks center PERIOD Through close reading and careful memorization of the guide you will get off to a great start in your journey to become your best Bearcat self if you think the gym will help PERIOD

Henkle Gym

Deep in the Sparks basement on the edge of a labyrinth of locker rooms adjacent to the pool lies the Henkle Gym PERIOD The Henkle gym includes such amenities as two state of the art basketball courts a decrepit and defunct rock climbing wall and an awkward view of  treadmill runners through the high windows PERIOD The enchantingly brutalist exposed brick and concrete walls inspire strength and discipline in Henkle patrons PERIOD In the evening Henkle often teems with basketball and volleyball players participating in pickup games and organized intramural matches alike PERIOD Players range in skill level from beginner to pretty good PERIOD Everybody seems friendly and likely to include new players PERIOD If you cant find a group that matches your sports culture its worth trying again another night PERIOD

In the early mornings I imagine the overpowering vacancy of Henkle Gym will make you feel like a well trained animal in an elaborate enclosure PERIOD Bring your favorite enrichment objects and burn off some of that infamous Willamette steam

Sparks Fitness Center Downstairs

The downstairs section of the sparks fitness center houses several squat racks benches free dumbbells and a rotating rock wall PERIOD When I tried to climb on the rotating rock wall I immediately became afraid that I looked silly PERIOD Ultimately the rotating rock wall demands more of the mind than the body making it a unique object in the fitness center PERIOD Do you have the self confidence to meet its challenge

The downstairs can be described as noticeably Jocko Willinkesque PERIOD  Here you can find topoftheline motivational instagram accounts and learn how to do a bodybuilder lat spread PERIOD Lions sheep or something like that PERIOD Keep it up lions

The main attraction of the downstairs is its coveted water fountain an Elkay EZH2O which mirrors its upstairs counterpart in every way except for water temperature in which the downstairs fountain holds a decisive edge in coldness PERIOD Drinking from the downstairs water fountain feels much like dancing through a light and snowy cloud except that instead of dancing you are actually just drinking really cold water from an Elkay EZH2O water fountain at the sparks fitness center PERIOD

Sparks Pool

On one wall of the Sparks Pool room four banners read in the following order camaraderie respect unity grit PERIOD I jumped in the pool at the deep end and swam to the very bottom approximately ten feet though I didnt ask and saw that the words on the banners said nothing at all and instead looked like brownish blobs PERIOD Such is the magical power of the Sparks pool water PERIOD While a Willamette students life overpours with abstract concepts and tricky words in the pool all of these burdens slip out of your mind and into the comfortably heated depths PERIOD Once confined between the floating lane guides my goals and dreams were reduced to a simple need to breathe and move PERIOD For the best therapeutic results visit the pool in the middle of the day as you are likely to find empty space PERIOD During my visit to the Sparks pool a lifeguard told me that the pool is Just a pool. the Taoist philosopher Lao Tzu has been quoted through translation as saying Nothing on earth is so weak and yielding as water but for breaking down the firm and strong it has no equal. visit the Sparks pool and decide who put it better

Sparks Fitness Center Upstairs

The upstairs section of the fitness center acts as the cultural center of the entire Sparks complex PERIOD The broad array of machines and weights attracts a large population of diverse exercise enthusiasts PERIOD For the less socially inclined lifter avoid the upstairs in the early evening hours PERIOD For the even less socially inclined enjoy the quiet and tranquil multipurpose room PERIOD However you must be prepared to make unintentional eye contact with a stranger through one of the MPRs many mirrors PERIOD The greater fitness center also offers Sunday Lift Up Hours where Time is devoted to centering marginalized students across the spectrums of gender and body types for an empowering experience in Sparks Willamette website PERIOD During the research phase of A Guide to Sparks  Even Sparksier I had my doubts about whether a nosy white guy with a notepad would be a helpful addition to the Lift Up experience PERIOD Thus unfortunately I cannot offer much advice relating to Lift Up PERIOD However based on the website Lift Up seems like a great pathway to aid students on their quest to be Bearcat  PERIOD

Sparks Field

The Sparks Complex website claims that Sparks Field remains open during regular gym hours PERIOD However a normal swipe card does not always allow access to the field during said hours even if the field looks completely empty PERIOD Research into the elusive Sparks Field remains ongoing

Conclusion

The sparks facility acts as a delightful space for sprouting intellectuals to remedy the health defects derived from our straying from early lifestyles PERIOD Because your human frame hungers for the trials of preindustrialism at Sparks you can feed it the fauxmeat of the elliptical and treadmill

In all seriousness Sparks is a great resource especially considering the gloom of our Pacific Northwestern winter PERIOD In a recent interview Astoria native and habitual gym attendee Gerry Newenhof put it better than I ever could The gym is very nice. wild turkey population thrives in Salem urban areas
