5371,2020-05-31,"cOVID19 has made it feel impossible to hang out with friends PERIOD Having a chill study session trying out a new recipe and sharing a cup of tea over Zoom just doesnt feel the same as doing those things in person PERIOD But one of my favorite pastimes before the pandemic was escape rooms  I loved being immersed in the story working through challenging puzzles and creating a shared experience with my friends and family PERIOD Though I miss inperson escape rooms Ive found a game that delivers an adventure with many of the same elements PERIOD

Tick Tock A Tale for Two is a twoplayer coop puzzle game inspired by escape rooms so if you enjoy those youll probably enjoy this game too PERIOD You and your friend get sucked into a magical pocket watch and are whisked away to a world cloaked in magical realism and mystery PERIOD The gloomy atmosphere and feeling of being in an abandoned town create an immersive vaguely eerie setting PERIOD As you solve a series of wellbalanced puzzles you discover more and more fragments of the dark story of Amalie and Lrke sisters who come from a long line of clockmakers PERIOD

Navigating these puzzles requires detailed and coordinated communication PERIOD As Player  and Player  you and your friend have access to completely different sets of information that must be pieced together to make sense of the situation and progress through the game PERIOD If you dont describe what you see well enough your partner may not even realize that what theyre looking at is critical to the solution and youll both end up lost PERIOD

Logistically Tick Tock is a great game to play while social distancing PERIOD The game can be played across a range of devices  including mobile Mac PC tablet and Nintendo Switch  and doesnt require the two devices to be connected making it easy to set up and play the game PERIOD All you need is a way to speak to each other PERIOD My friend and I used Discord but anything that allows for voice chat like Zoom Skype or a regular phone will work just fine PERIOD Another feature that contributes to the games easy setup is its intuitive pointandclick controls PERIOD Additionally the game can easily be played in one sitting about  hours making it an ideal length for a hangout PERIOD

Tick Tock has also earned a lengthy list of awards and recognition including Most Inventive Google Play Award  and was most recently recognized only a few months ago when it was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award in March PERIOD This is quite impressive for Other Tales Interactives debut game PERIOD The studio consists of two writers and designers Tanja Lind Tankred and Mira Dorth who both come from a background of not games but literature PERIOD The duo taught themselves game development and art design specifically for Tick Tock. so if youre looking for a fun adventure to escape from the monotony of quarantine and have a puzzleloving friend to bring along for the ride Id highly recommend Tick Tock A Tale for Two. tick Tock is available for purchase on Steam . each Google Play . each the App Store . each and the Nintendo eShop . each PERIOD Youre in for a great time PERIOD
