Coach Bret Bielema and quarterback Brandon Peters high five before the game against Maryland on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Illini football needs to make some changes to improve during the rest of their season PERIOD

By Josh Pietsch Assistant OnAir Editor September  

Popular opinion over the past couple days is that the Illini could very well be  in conference play and  overall PERIOD That thought is due to a threepoint loss to Maryland at home followed by a fourpoint loss this past Saturday at Purdue PERIOD This opinion is more than fair but Im going to offer a new perspective PERIOD

Illinois should be  in conference play PERIOD

The  conference record is easily explainable but it needs some context PERIOD Against Maryland Illinois found itself leading  with just under five minutes to go in the fourth quarter PERIOD The Illini had entered Terrapin territory and faced a fourthand1 on the  PERIOD

If Illinois had gone for it it would have been in field goal range and had a very good chance to put the game away PERIOD Instead Bielema elected to take a delay of game penalty and punt PERIOD In the head coachs defense Blake Hayes is in my opinion the best punter in the country and the defense had been playing well for the first time in three weeks PERIOD

But Maryland drove  yards for a touchdown to tie the game PERIOD Quarterback Brandon Peters and the Illini got the ball back with about two minutes left but they couldnt put anything together and punted with under a minute left PERIOD A poor punt gave the Terrapins good field position and Maryland walked it off on a field goal PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

I didnt love the decision to punt but it was justified PERIOD Bielema loves his punter and had a defense that was playing decently PERIOD Breakout freshman running back Josh McCray had left the game so it was probably either a Peters sneak or a punt PERIOD Like I said Bielema explained his decision on a tough call and it can make sense PERIOD But it didnt work PERIOD

Fast forward a week PERIOD The Illini were up  at Purdue with about nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter facing a fourthand2 at the Boilermaker  PERIOD Kicker James McCourt was three of four for the day from field goals including one conversion and one miss from beyond  yards PERIOD The running game was the best part of the offense all game led once again by McCray PERIOD The defense was also once again playing well not allowing a point since Purdues second drive PERIOD

The situation was extremely similar to the week prior PERIOD All offensive metrics advised going for the first down whether it be a run pass or fieldgoal attempt PERIOD McCourt had made one on the previous drive and was successful from  yards out earlier in the game which is how long the field goal would have been from PERIOD

Bielema elected to punt again PERIOD

And what do you know Purdue scored a touchdown on the next drive taking a  lead PERIOD Illinois was able to get inside the red zone on the next drive but ultimately were stopped on downs PERIOD The Boilermakers then ran out the clock and the Illini lost again PERIOD

So this is where my  conference record comes in PERIOD I dont blame Bielema for his decision against Maryland because it was his first time faced with that situation PERIOD But once is a fluke and twice is a pattern PERIOD

He defended his decision against Purdue by saying he didnt want to have to pass the ball on fourthand2 PERIOD Peters wasnt playing great well get to that later but Bielema also said McCourt had just missed a field goal from that length PERIOD Thats not really true PERIOD He made one from that length for his first field goal of the game missed one from  two attempts later and his most recent attempt was a make from  PERIOD

In my eyes Illinois goes for the field goal McCourt makes it and the Illini go up  PERIOD Purdue gets its touchdown taking a  lead PERIOD

But the Illini found themselves inside the Boilermaker 20yard line on their last drive which McCourt is money from PERIOD He makes a field goal and Illinois takes down Purdue on the road  PERIOD

If Bret had decided to go for it on fourth down two weeks in a row then yes its very possible Illinois is  in the Big Ten PERIOD But its not fair to expect him to get it right the first time when he hadnt been in that situation yet with the Illini PERIOD Its the second time that really gets me so that is where my  record really comes from PERIOD

The real issue here is that Bielema didnt learn from his mistake and not only that but he defended his decision after Purdue saying hed punt  times over. everyone has to learn to admit when they mess up and Bielema did not do that PERIOD

Bielema started as a head coach in  at Wisconsin so he doesnt resemble the newer play styles or decisionmaking seen by some younger coaches in  PERIOD Same with his offensive coordinator Tony Petersen PERIOD Bielema punting the first time around resembles how teams probably played when he started coaching but you cant live in the past PERIOD Especially in sports where the game continues to change PERIOD

Speaking of his traditional coaching style both Bielema and Petersen love the traditional quarterback which Peters resembles PERIOD 6foot5 strong arm pocket passer PERIOD

He also has the ability to use his feet effectively but we saw much more of that under former offensive coordinator Rod Smiths offense than Petersens PERIOD

Peters who is in his sixth year of college and third at Illinois was injured in the first quarter of game one against Nebraska PERIOD Backup Art Sitkowski who has sophomore eligibility was put in the game and led Illinois to a win PERIOD He also was the starter the next two games home against UTSA and at Virginia both of which Illinois lost PERIOD

His stats however werent that bad PERIOD Against Nebraska UTSA and Virginia Sitkowski threw for  yards and two touchdowns  yards and three touchdowns and  yards and one touchdown respectively PERIOD His only interception came at Virginia which really wasnt his fault at all PERIOD

Sitkowski wasnt great but he held his own PERIOD Its also very notable that as of now hes QB1 on the depth chart for next year PERIOD

As for Peters in two games since returning from his injury he threw for  yards and an interception against Maryland and  yards at Purdue PERIOD No touchdowns PERIOD

I dont blame Bielema and Petersen one bit for starting Peters against Purdue after his disappointing performance against Maryland PERIOD I would have done the same thing PERIOD But as I said earlier once is a fluke and twice is a pattern PERIOD

Nothing is official but it looks like Peters is gonna start again this coming week against Charlotte PERIOD

Sitkowski isnt even that much of a different quarterback than Peters PERIOD Hes also a 6foot5 pocket passer and his feet arent as mobile as Peters PERIOD I know Brandon has the experience with Illinois but even that isnt super impressive PERIOD

Peters has thrown for  yards five times as an Illini which Art did in both of his starts this season PERIOD Brandon also really struggled with consistency and completion percentage in his first two seasons at Illinois which also was put on display in the two full games he played this season PERIOD

Its time for another change PERIOD Sitkowski has better stats this year is younger and has been more consistent PERIOD In fact its arguable that if Art started the last two weeks Illinois would be  in conference play but Im not going to say that that is a totally fair argument right now PERIOD

What I do care about is the future and right now thats the issue at hand PERIOD Barring a miracle Illinois isnt getting even close to making a bowl game this year so its time to start at least considering what can happen next year PERIOD Bielema and staff will probably hit the transfer portal for a quarterback this offseason but Art also is a product of the transfer portal and is only a sophomore PERIOD

It seems only right to play him but all signs point to Peters starting again this coming week PERIOD

The ongoing theme here is that Bielema has been unwilling on two major occasions to make the adjustments he has needed to make to win PERIOD Being aggressive on fourth down can win you a game which the Baltimore Ravens showed in between Illinois losses to Maryland and Purdue PERIOD And a quarterback is the most important position in sports and the captain of the offense PERIOD

Being this conservative reflects Bielemas past coaching situations but Illinois isnt Wisconsin and  isnt  PERIOD Its OK to admit when youre wrong PERIOD

Id like to add in right now that I have not in any way given up on Bielema despite the harsh criticism Ive given in this column because everything else has been pretty darn good PERIOD

In my opinion other than Petersen he has hired a great staff led by his defensive coordinator hire Ryan Walters PERIOD Walters is young willing to make changes from play to play and has gotten the most so far out of a defense that at the end of the day just isnt very talented PERIOD After poor defensive performances in games two and three Walters and the defense came back and allowed  combined points in games four and five PERIOD

Bielema also has been recruiting the heck out of the state of Illinois which he promised to do and is a main reason athletic director Josh Whitman chose him as head coach PERIOD

Hes kept Illinois competitive and despite only having one win to show for it four of five games this year have been close and exciting PERIOD Hes doing a good job PERIOD

My hope going forward is that Bielema will make better adjustments when needed and stop being so conservative about everything PERIOD Take risks whether that be on a fourth down late in the game or starting a quarterback that is less experienced PERIOD

I loved and still do really like Bret Bielema as the hire for Illinois and truly think he is moving this program in the right direction PERIOD None of his players right now are his own which is why I wont give up on him for at least his first four years PERIOD

But to coach a winning team adjustments are necessary PERIOD I just hope those necessary adjustments will start now PERIOD
