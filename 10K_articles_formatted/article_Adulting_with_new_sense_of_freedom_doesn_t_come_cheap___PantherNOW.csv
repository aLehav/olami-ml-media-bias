In addition to the stress of deciding where to pursue higher education students face new challenges when they transition from high school to the university level PERIOD

High school does a great job teaching students academically said Oren Shibi University psychologist for the Counseling and Psychological Services center PERIOD There are problems that high schools dont teach students including how to be financially responsible and being able to control the feeling of independence. according to Dr PERIOD Ben Griffith from the University of Kentucky there are  changes that happen to students when transitioning from high school to college PERIOD

One of the biggest changes is the new awareness of personal responsibility college offers a sense of freedom most students arent used to and that can be both a blessing and a curse PERIOD

In high school students were given homework that was usually due the very next day now students are given assignments weeks in advance PERIOD Some are even scheduled months in advance yet some students keep the same mentality which results in completing assignments the day before theyre due PERIOD

Its definitely not as fun as I thought college would be said Marina Trujillo a senior psychology major PERIOD Its a lot of work trying to maintain a balance between work and friends. according to the College Atlas website  percent of college and university students drop out after their first year of college PERIOD Some students also experience isolation stress and some apprehension with their chosen major PERIOD

To help with this students attending the University are encouraged to join clubs and find people with similar interests PERIOD Clubs and associations ranging from student government to pool club are available to interested students PERIOD

The great thing about the University is that I have so many clubs to choose from said Rinat Latypov a freshman business management major PERIOD I really enjoy the opportunities I get to have. another issue deal with is the cost of college PERIOD For many students who graduated from public high schools they never had to pay for school and now they are faced with the harsh price of a college education PERIOD

According to Brian Pivik content manager for Petersons Blog lack of money is one of the biggest reasons students leave school PERIOD It ends up costing too much or students find themselves having to get a fulltime job to save up for college PERIOD

Luckily for FIU students the cost of enrollment for instate students is  PERIOD The average cost of tuition in the U.S PERIOD is  according to the College Board PERIOD For those who cannot afford to pay out of pocket government aid namely the Free Application for Federal Student Aid exists to provide financial support to students PERIOD

Whether its caused by financial troubles difficulties integrating or overwhelming responsibilities the University offers support for students at the Counseling and Psychological Services Department through oneonone talks 24hour hotlines and online services PERIOD
