Tips to Help You Define and Discover Your Potential

Review the following tips to help you discover your own definition of potential and what success and potential truly mean to you PERIOD

 PERIOD Know Yourself

Assess your current skills and performance by writing down some of your greatest strengths and weaknesses PERIOD This involves necessary reflection asking for specific feedback and being receptive to input from hopefully a variety of people in a variety of contexts PERIOD This should be an ongoing process and it will take time humility and a willingness to confront your shortcomings and fears PERIOD However people can and do change and improve after recognizing both their strengths and weaknesses PERIOD Make the decision to change and grow and it will help you move forward PERIOD

 PERIOD Excel at Critical Tasks

 PERIOD Demonstrate Character and Leadership

Character and leadership often make the difference between good performance and great performance PERIOD Pillars of good character include trustworthiness

respect responsibility fairness caring and citizenship to name a few PERIOD Leaders are willing to do things for others without regard to whats in it for them PERIOD Being a leader also means being willing to speak up even if you have to express an unpopular view PERIOD Spend more time thinking about who you truly are and what you truly believe rather than what others want you to be or say PERIOD

 PERIOD Set Goals and Benchmarks

Narrow in on what youd like to accomplish even if these are just shortterm goals PERIOD Take baby steps brainstorm ways to get to where you want to be and seek out mentors PERIOD Keep a success list to remind yourself that you are good enough PERIOD Dont ever think your accomplishments are too small to be proud of PERIOD It is easy to think that when you compare yourself to others so try not to PERIOD
