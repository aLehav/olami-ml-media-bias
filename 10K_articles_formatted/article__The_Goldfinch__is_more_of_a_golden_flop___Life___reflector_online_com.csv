Donna Tartts  Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Goldfinchfinally made its way to the silver screen this weekend PERIOD The book received overwhelmingly positive acclaim upon its release for its endearing cast of characters and unique story about a catastrophic event that changes the life of protagonist Theo Decker played by Ansel Elgort PERIOD

Critics have slammed the film since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival three weeks ago PERIOD According to Box Office Mojo the film was a commercial bust as it debuted with an opening weekend of less than . million on an estimated  milliondollar budget PERIOD Getting past the harsh reaction from the box office and criticsIs The Goldfinch really that bad or is it a diamond in the rough

The story follows a young boy named Theo Decker after his mother is killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art PERIOD He survives the bombing takes a ring given to him by a dying man and steals his mothers favorite painting  from the rubble PERIOD He is put into the care of his friends family until his absent father returns played by Luke Wilson to cash in on his sons potential inheritance which brings him to Las Vegas PERIOD The film follows Theos 20year journey and jumps back and forth from his childhood to his adult life which is pretty evenly split between the first and second half of the film PERIOD

The film begins in Amsterdam with an older Theo reminiscing on what brought him abroad PERIOD From the first shot of the film I was in awe of Roger Deakins gorgeous cinematography PERIOD With a runtime of  minutes if the movie did not look as great as it does it would be much harder to stay invested PERIOD Deakins is a master cinematographer as he shot films such as   and  PERIOD

Along with the cinematography the performances were all pretty solid PERIOD Finn Wolfhard as the character Boris Theos neighbor in Vegas and his best friend stood out the most PERIOD Wolfhard had a strange performance and while I would hesitate to call it good his backstory and relationship with Theo is tragicallyheartwarming PERIOD The accent is not great but the character of Boris in the novel is supposed to be from several different countries so it makes sense that the accent is all over the place PERIOD Boriss adult portion of the story is not nearly as compelling but it is nice to see the two reunite in the third act PERIOD Also the soundtrack for the film is excellent with songs from New Order Animal Collective and Radiohead PERIOD

One of the standout scenes for me personally was the introduction of James Hobart whose story ties in with the dead mans ring from the museum PERIOD Hobarts antique shop always felt warm and comforting and the fatherson type of relationship between Theo and Hobart adds an emotional layer to the film PERIOD

Another of my favorite scenes is when Boris and Theos friendship really begins to develop when they are kids PERIOD In one scene they go for a swim soundtracked by the Radiohead song  It is a beautifully shot surreal scene and one of the images is on the poster for the film PERIOD

Though the film has a run time of about two and a half hours my big nitpick was the editing and pacing PERIOD The film begins the same way the book does with Theos monologue in Amsterdam but then it assumes the viewer has some knowledge of the source material then skips straight to Theo in custody of his friend Andys family PERIOD The movie is built upon flashbacks which do not add anything since the book follows such a linear narrative PERIOD Flashbacks just serve to confuse the average viewer and the film does not show the bombing itself PERIOD Instead it shows snippets of it in scenes that do not structurally make sense PERIOD This was extremely annoying and it made the film worse PERIOD

All in all I think  was a good film and I did not regret seeing it PERIOD However critics online have slammed the film for being pretentious Oscarbait.IT Chapter Two.The GoldfinchThe Goldfinch.The Goldfinch might be for you PERIOD Just be sure to check it out soon because it probably will not be in theaters long PERIOD
