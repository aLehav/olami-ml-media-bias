Recent Macalester grad former library student worker puppet enthusiast and previous student organizer for Proud Indigenous Peoples for Education PIPE Jennings Mergenthal  spoke at the Dewitt Wallace Library Monday about their role in renaming the Humanities Building in  from its former signifier Neill Hall PERIOD The Department of Multicultural Life hosted the event and served tamales traditional preColumbian food wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves PERIOD

Mergenthal presented about and critiqued several of Macalesters founders and their actions against Indigenous peoples PERIOD Several buildings around campus are still named after the benefactors to the college despite their racist and dehumanizing language against many diverse groups PERIOD

Mergenthal also criticized the processes that Macalesters administration took in their consideration of the student demands to change the name of Neill Hall  saying administration focused more on the reputation of the college than on communitywide considerations PERIOD

Heres the sort of work performance you can expect from decaying corpse of higher education Macalester College Mergenthal said PERIOD

Mergenthal gave an overview of the founding fathers of Macalester all white men that were benefactors to the college PERIOD They especially focused on Edward Duffield Neill a presbyterian missionary who founded Macalester in  after years of supporting settler colonialism in the DakotaMinnesota territories and advocating for forced assimilation and regulation of native peoples whom he called savages in several of his documented writings PERIOD

Neill also was a severe critic of coeducating men and women until his death in  PERIOD Mergenthal noted that in concert with the Science Museum of Minnesota where Mergenthal now works Neill excavated and robbed several mass graves at Saint Pauls Indian Mounds Regional Park and Cemetery where Mergenthal also worked previously PERIOD

Mergenthal questioned how the administration could not have known about Neills problematic politics before they named the nowcalled Humanities Building after him in  until The Mac Weekly released a special publication devoted to the topic PERIOD

Mergenthal said that former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg and the board finally started questioning the stillrecent naming of the building after The Pioneer Press and other newspapers in Scotland later picked up on the story of the sordid pasts of Macalesters founders PERIOD

Mergenthal was in a theater production LettersHome in the spring of  that they credit with inspiring Rosenberg to take the name off the Humanities building PERIOD

Heres what actually happenedOne of the things we had done in the show was a landmapping thing that involved talking about some of the racist things that Neill said Mergenthal said PERIOD President Brian Rosenberg came to the show and I made eye contact with him the whole time. mergenthal claimed that Rosenberg and the board of trustees pulled the rug out from under any further debate when he and the board finally changed the name of Neill Hall suddenly in  PERIOD

By coming out ahead and unilaterally renaming it without any sort of organized push which we PIPE were preparing for  by making that look like their choice and their action that the board made their own report they really stole any chance for broader momentum or a broader consideration of people like Frederick Weyerhaeuser or people like Franklin Olin Mergenthal said PERIOD

But by doing that and preserving the optics of the building and the optics of the college they avoided having any sort of substantial push to analyze the actual reason the building got famous in the first place they said PERIOD The sorts of lack of awareness of history and institutional positionality and the way that history is done is so often like Heres a founder on a pedestal this figure is great and perfect. mergenthal was critical of The Mac Weeklys work around Macalesters founders in their publication Colonial Macalester on Nov PERIOD   PERIOD The paper Mergenthal said was more to advance the journalists personal careers and less to bring about systemic change PERIOD The Mac Weekly published the issue Colonial Macalester on the work that PIPE had been advocating around for six years previously capitalizing upon it according to them PERIOD

They also made digs at Macalesters benefactors such as Frederick Weyerhaeuser a logging tycoon engineer and gun manufacturer Franklin Olin and DeWitt Wallace the son of one of Macalesters presidents who later donated significantly to the school after starting Readers Digest and then forced Macalester President James Robinson to cut funding for the Expanded Educational Opportunities program EEO in  which his money was largely supporting PERIOD

Mergenthal will also speak at the International Roundtable on the topic of student protests and unsettling power relationships PERIOD

PIPE members Zoe Allen  and AJ Papakee  helped organize the posters of famous Indigenous leaders placed over official campus building names each year after the renaming of the Humanities Building and were present at Mergenthals teachin on Indigenous Peoples Day PERIOD

It is just kind of making sure that actions like the concerted effort behind renaming the building dont go unnoticed and trying to reestablish a presence on campus Allen said PERIOD We put up signs every year that have Indigenous historical figures so you just walk around campus and see what those look like. emailprotected



A previous version of this article quoted the title of the theater production Mergenthal took part in as Letters Home PERIOD The correct stylization is LettersHome PERIOD

A previous version of this article incorrectly named the Macalester president who made cuts to the EEO PERIOD It was President James Robinson not President Arthur Flemming PERIOD
