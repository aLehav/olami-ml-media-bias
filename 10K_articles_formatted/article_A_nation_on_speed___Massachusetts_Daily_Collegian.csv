We are a nation on speed a generation on speed PERIOD We do more in less time than ever before and the major restrictions on this productivity are the very limitations that make us human the need for sleep rest rejuvenation and nourishment PERIOD But what happens to human limits when chemical stimulants play such a major role in our societys work
In an article which first appeared in URB Magazine in October  Todd C PERIOD Roberts wrote Our generation could be considered the sleepless generation PERIOD An age of societys children weaned on the ideals of highspeed communication and accelerated culture has prided itself in mastering many of the facets of human existence doing more sleeping less PERIOD The machines of this age have in a way enabled us to create a 24hour lifestyle PERIOD However the limitations of the human existence like sleep may still provide the stumbling block for infinite realization PERIOD That is without chemical aid. roberts goes on to discuss the use of amphetamines to overcome the constraints our humanity inflicts upon and keeps up with our hectic pace of lives PERIOD The issue is one of great relevance for students PERIOD There are not enough hours in the day to do everything expected of us or take advantage of all the opportunities presented to us PERIOD Amphetamines for many become the answer PERIOD Get a hold of an amphetamine and you dont need to sleep as much you eat less or perhaps you can focus for longer periods PERIOD
You can buy them anywhere from your dorm druggist or the kid next door PERIOD Everyone seems to be on them come finals week PERIOD They make your heart race and your pulse jump they give you false energy and hype you up PERIOD However they remain highly addictive narcotics that can easily burn you out PERIOD
