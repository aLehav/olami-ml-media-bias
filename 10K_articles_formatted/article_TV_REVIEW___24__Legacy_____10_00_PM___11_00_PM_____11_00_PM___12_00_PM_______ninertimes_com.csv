Spoiler Warning for the final hours of  Legacy as well as all previous seasons of the original series PERIOD

THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN  P.M PERIOD AND  P.M PERIOD

EVENTS OCCUR IN REAL TIME PERIOD

First off I would like to apologize for missing last week end of the semester duties take precedence over  Legacy unfortunately PERIOD This review will cover the final two episodes of the season PERIOD What an uneven  hours this has been starting off strong before fizzling out in the middle and dragging to an explosive final few episodes PERIOD The longest day of Eric Carters life has been filled with many twists and turns but also speed bumps and random events PERIOD While the shows future is still uncertain the first season is plenty of fun even with its problems PERIOD

Following the climactic showdown at the abandoned football field Eric and Senator Donovan come to terms with the fact that Rebecca has been abducted PERIOD John confronts Eric about his inability to keep Rebecca safe clearly in shock from the traumatic past few hours PERIOD Without any real lead Eric enlists the help of Andy and CTU to see if there is any way to track BinKhalid PERIOD Of course some drama arises when Director Simms phones Keith to tell him that a man named Daniel Pang C.S PERIOD Lee will be arriving to oversee CTUs operations PERIOD This obviously bothers Keith but his hands are completely tied that is until Andy pulls him aside to alert him to something shady he has discovered PERIOD Andy has worked his skills and found a link between Director Simms and Naseri the daughter of Naseri is being held in a house somewhere in the DC area apparently in an undercover operation commanded by Simms PERIOD Eric heads up the operation to investigate Simms with the help of Senator Donovan because of the small fact that Simms works in the Pentagon Eric obviously realizes that he cant just stroll into the Pentagon but John has special access as a Senator PERIOD

At CTU Andy and Mariana quickly come up with a cover story and manipulate an identification card to allow Eric to disguise himself as a Secret Service agent PERIOD Theres some tension as Erics newly forged ID doesnt work right away at Pentagon security but he ultimately gets in PERIOD Before Eric and Senator Donovan arrive however Director Simms puts in a call to Tony asking him to collect Naseris daughter and transport her away this is part of Simms plan of removing himself from his failed operation PERIOD Eric and John enter Simms office only to pull a gun on him and hold him hostage demanding answers and the location of Naseris daughter PERIOD Director Simms doesnt budge but Eric is able to find out where the daughter is being held PERIOD With Naseri linked up with BinKhalid Eric reasons that he will be able to trade the daughter for Rebecca effectively revealing where the terrorists are holed up PERIOD This is still  though and nothing every goes as planned PERIOD

Meanwhile Rebecca isnt in the best position as she is thrown into the back of a van bound and gagged PERIOD BinKhalid holds steady on his plan of executing Rebecca live on the Internet even though their first attempt failed and Jadalla was killed in the process PERIOD Rebecca knows that she cannot allow herself to go down like that so she takes matters into her own hands literally and uses glass from a broken bottle to slit her wrists PERIOD Naseri and the others quickly find Rebecca bleeding out and do everything they can to save her I dont know how but she actually survived this seemingly fatal wound PERIOD This is what separates this kidnapping storyline from those in previous seasons Rebecca isnt a victim but rather a soldier one that is willing to commit suicide rather than being used as a pawn in the evil games of the terrorists PERIOD

Eric manages to locate the house where Naseris daughter is being held he takes down the two guards and finds the young girl in a makeshift cell inside the house PERIOD Of course this rescue operation isnt as easy as it seems and the arrival of a crew of gunmen complicates the situation PERIOD This is complicated even further when it is revealed that the gunmen are led by Tony who is carrying out Simms orders PERIOD The episode wraps up with everyone stepping up to the plate Senator Donovan holds Director Simms at gunpoint and demands that he end Tonys operation but he refuses and John knocks him out PERIOD Back at CTU Keith realizes that Daniel is about to discover the undercover mission that he is manning and knocks him out as well PERIOD A cliffhanger ends the episode as Tony yells at Eric to give up Naseris daughter PERIOD

THE CLOCK STRIKES  P.M PERIOD

THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN  P.M PERIOD AND  P.M PERIOD

EVENTS OCCUR IN REAL TIME PERIOD

Well folks weve finally reached the last hour actually the last thirteen hours of  Legacy. eric Carter is racing to stop terrorists all the while receiving help from CTU as the clock ticks on PERIOD This finale just might be the best of the season and perfectly sets up the next day should FOX choose to renew the series PERIOD Will the bad guys win or will good conquer all

Following the dramatic cliffhanger at the end of last episode we finally get to see the showdown between Tony and Eric PERIOD This places the viewer in a difficult position do we root for our current hero or one that weve been following for ten seasons now Of course Erics success is crucial to the nations security but I couldnt help wanting Tony to win or at least not die PERIOD While I have made it clear that I believe Tonys role in Legacy has been complete fan service I will say that this fight scene definitely added to his return seeing Tony kick ass really is quite epic PERIOD Meanwhile at the Pentagon Senator Donovan repeatedly demands that Director Simms call off Tonys operation to no luck PERIOD John decides to call Tony himself and explain the situation with Rebecca utilizing the clear feelings that Tony still has for her PERIOD John is hit with a bombshell when Simms reveals to him that Rebecca was heavily involved in the kidnapping of Naseris daughter PERIOD Tony allows Eric to leave with Naseris daughter before exiting the series himself Tonys storyline this season comes to an end in a rather anticlimatic fashion PERIOD

The monitors at CTU are plastered with images from BinKhalids live broadcast of Rebeccas impending execution PERIOD There is clear terror as Andy Keith and the others watch their beloved colleague being put through this ordeal PERIOD Thankfully the situation takes a turn as Naseris daughter tells Eric her fathers phone number I have absolutely no clue why he would still be using the same phone number considering he is on the run from the law PERIOD Eric dials the number and Naseri answers moving away to a quiet area as BinKhalid continues to read off Rebeccas crimes PERIOD With Naseris daughter as leverage Eric threatens to take drastic measures if he doesnt comply PERIOD A flip is switched inside Naseri and he interrupts the live broadcast to kill some of the terrorists and subdue BinKhalid PERIOD Eric and Naseri get back in contact and set up a plan that includes the daughter being turned over to the Jordanian Embassy and Rebecca being freed but Eric knows this is his final chance to eliminate the combatants once and for all PERIOD

This is where the situation really escalates quickly as Eric meets up with Naseri and Keith flies the daughter to the embassy PERIOD One of Naseris demands is that he is allowed to view his daughters safe passage into the embassy via video chat once she is safely in Jordanian custody he releases Rebecca to Eric but BinKhalids wrath has one final deadly result PERIOD Using a gun BinKhalid fires several shots hitting Naseri and prompting Rebecca to cover Eric only to be shot herself PERIOD Eric finishes BinKhalid off before tending to Rebeccas chest gunshot wound PERIOD An ambulance arrives to the scene and transports Rebecca to a local hospital Eric rides along and Rebecca offers some moving advice encouraging him to do what he loves and follow his heart PERIOD Word gets to Senator Donovan who lashes out at Director Simms telling him that his involvement will see the light of day soon PERIOD John rushes to the hospital as Rebecca is wheeled in he reunites with Eric as doctors and nurses treat Rebecca but they are ultimately too late PERIOD John and Eric are completely shell shocked as Rebecca flat lines the signature silent clock appears to honor Rebecca as the heart rate monitor rings out PERIOD

Much like  Live Another Day the realtime aspect is abandoned for the final ten minutes as the story fastforwards twelve hours to around  a.m. complete with a picturesque sunrise to ring in the new day PERIOD Senator Donovan sits in the morgue with the now deceased Rebecca PERIOD Nilaa interrupts Johns mourning to remind him about his phone call with the party leader PERIOD She also tells him that Henry has arrived and wishes to see him following a bumpy twentyfour hours the father and son are reunited although under somber circumstances PERIOD Henry explains that Johns poll numbers have increased and that he should consider staying in the race but John realizes that this is likely only the result of Rebeccas death PERIOD Henry takes a few moments to share his guilt for the deaths and chaos he contributed to even offering to turn himself in if John wishes PERIOD In a last minute twist an FBI agent arrives to tell John that Director Simms committed suicide in his office not long after he left this opens up the possibility of a major scandal storyline for Season  especially considering John chooses to remain in the presidential race PERIOD The day comes to an end in an uplifting way as Eric reunites with Nicole and explains that he wishes to stay in this line of work PERIOD Nicole really surprises me in this moment as she states that she is willing to make things work and stand beside Eric so long as they both promise to be honest with each other moving forward thankfully they didnt go they predictable route of making Nicole leave Eric or die like I originally predicted PERIOD The Carter Family seems to be okay but will Isaac throw a wrench into things next season

THE CLOCK STRIKES  P.M PERIOD

 Legacy is not a perfect season but it really is an enjoyable ride that maintains the classic feel of the original series even if it doesnt do much to separate itself PERIOD These final two episodes prove that the show can be great if the focus remains on telling gripping character stories while delivering pulsepounding action PERIOD I have enjoyed Corey Hawkins as Eric Carter and I truly believe this actor and character were the right choices to carry the franchise into the future PERIOD The death of Rebecca is heartbreaking but necessary for the future of the series this finale loss is similar to the death of Jack Bauers wife Teri in the first seasons final few seconds PERIOD Miranda Otto brought a lot to the character and the season and her presence will definitely be missed PERIOD Other strong characters include Andy and Mariana both really impressing me these past few episodes I do hope that they are given more to do moving forward PERIOD At the time of publishing FOX has yet to make a formal announcement about the future of  Legacy. based on the first season I definitely believe the series should be renewed especially with the twelveepisode format PERIOD Once the decision is made this post will be updated but until then the clock rests PERIOD

UPDATE FOX has officially cancelled  Legacy after one season but has announced that a continuation of the franchise is currently being explored PERIOD
