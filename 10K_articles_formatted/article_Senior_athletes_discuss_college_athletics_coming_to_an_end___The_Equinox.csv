The term athlete may be just a word to some but for others it is who they are PERIOD

For Keene State College senior athletes it is no different PERIOD

Most student athletes have been playing their sports since a young age with the push from friends and family members PERIOD

I started playing softball when I was eight years old because my neighbor played and then I started pitching when I was in third grade senior softball pitcher Mariah Crisp said PERIOD

The school year is winding down in both academics and athletics and this means that students are beginning to realize that the one thing that has been constant in their lives may be changing forever PERIOD

Lacrosse attack Kaitlin Nolan said I have been playing for so long and my sister influenced me when I was young to start playing lacrosse PERIOD

When athletes have identified themselves with a sport for so long it can be difficult to imagine a life without it PERIOD

I still have a lot of goals I want to meet this season and you have to get into the mental mindset that this will be your last time Nolan said PERIOD

For division  athletes the demand may not be as high but these athletes are still expected to dedicate a large portion of their time into their sports PERIOD

I devote ten months to pitching a year my life has always been about softball Crisp said PERIOD

Now that seniors are looking ahead they have to think about whether or not they will try to continue playing their sport after graduation PERIOD

Senior lefthanded pitcher Keith Simpson said I dont think that I will be able to play in an actual league after graduation so I will work even harder this season. as for Nolan she said I probably wont play but I can see myself coaching. the student athletes receive much support from families friends and especially coaches PERIOD

My coach Katie Arsenault is so supportive and has been that way throughout all of my fours years at KSC Nolan said PERIOD

The coaches act as a stable ground for these athletes during their time at Keene State PERIOD

She has not treated me any different from my first year to now but has higher expectations now that Im a senior Nolan added PERIOD

Some athletes take time to reflect on the thought of their last season but others said they feel it is almost better to not think about it PERIOD

I try not to think about it it goes so fast Simpson said PERIOD

While it is their last season these three athletes agreed that they need to stay focused and keep their eyes on having a successful season and hopefully win a championship PERIOD

The ultimate goal would be to give one last go at it and get an LEC championship Simpson said PERIOD

Not only are these three seniors separating from their sport they are separating from a team that has become their family PERIOD

Leaving the team is definitely going to be hard theyre my forever friends so I know I will be in touch with them after graduation Nolan said PERIOD

With spring sports just beginning and winter sports coming to a close at KSC these seniors had a moment to reflect back on what advice they would give to firstyear PERIOD

They all agreed not to rush it because it will be over in an instant PERIOD

I would say soak it all in because everyone says time flies and theyre right Simpson said PERIOD
