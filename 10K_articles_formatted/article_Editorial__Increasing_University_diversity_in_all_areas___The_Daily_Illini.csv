Beyond the academic opportunities of attending the University the diverse student body provides experiences people might not receive in their hometowns PERIOD

While some may live in communities with racially and culturally diverse populations the University is a mecca of cultures PERIOD From experiencing iUnites hijab challenge on the Main Quad on Monday to Holi to a Black Lives Matter protest there are events to open ones eyes here that cant always be found at home PERIOD

Breaking down the numbers  percent of our undergraduate student population is Asian five percent is AfricanAmerican and eight percent is Hispanic PERIOD The variety of student ethnicities need diverse teaching populations to match it PERIOD

Recently a new study by graduate student Lester Lusher and professors from the University of California at Davis and the New York Economic School in Russia showed that undergraduate students are more likely to earn higher grades when their teaching assistants are of the same race or ethnicity PERIOD

Lusher said as early as the second week of school students are more likely to attend their TAs session if they are a similar race PERIOD The study results were completed at an anonymous California university PERIOD



Its important to have diversity in all of our faculty members because they provide viewpoints from their own personal backgrounds we may not otherwise receive PERIOD

This fall University enrollment of Latino students has increased . percent AfricanAmerican student enrollment increased . percent in the last year PERIOD But the numbers just increasing isnt enough PERIOD We question what the results of the study would be if it was conducted at the University of Illinois PERIOD Like the study says students relate better to TAs who are the same ethnicity PERIOD By increasing the amount of TAs  or the diversity within the current amount of TAs  we could potentially increase diversity in incoming freshman classes which administration strives for PERIOD

The University does not track the racial ethnicity of its TAs but this is something we encourage it to record and promote just like it does with enrollment numbers PERIOD

And the enrollment numbers we have still are not as diverse as The Daily Illini Editorial Board would like them to be PERIOD In order to provide a truly diverse campus with a variety of learning opportunities we need to have TAs of all races involved in every college and area of study PERIOD Seeing TAs in academic roles can be inspiring to someone of a similar ethnicity who isnt sure if they fit at the University PERIOD

Providing diverse leadership in the classroom ultimately provides two benefits PERIOD It provides a method for students to learn and understand a culture other than their own while also creating a space where people of minority students feel comfortable to learn PERIOD",Editorial: Increasing University diversity in all areas - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
