2495,2023-10-26,"during college it is very easy to fall into a negative spiral PERIOD Youre away from home you may be away from people who are dear to you and you have to develop a new support system and adjust to new surroundings PERIOD This spiral ends tragically for more than  college student per year  more than  college students who take their own lives PERIOD Thats more than an entire graduating class at the University PERIOD

College is a time for exploration for finding and realizing potential for becoming the person you are going to be PERIOD But to accomplish those things one must explore life on a personal level PERIOD Taking others feelings and thoughts into account truly realizing what theyre saying how theyre acting may get left behind PERIOD

Two Rutgers University students have been accused of streaming a fellow students sexual encounter online the likely trigger for the students apparent suicide on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD The invasion of privacy that occurred is inexcusable PERIOD It puts on display the consequences of such actions PERIOD But attack or no attack take an active role in making sure the people close to you at this school are supported PERIOD Watch out for your roommates and friends PERIOD Make sure they get the help that they need PERIOD For many of us college is the first time we are no longer surrounded by the people who know us best PERIOD

On the flipside one of the best parts of college is not having someone watch you all the time and answering more to yourself than anyone else PERIOD If you are someone who needs help who needs to talk to someone seek out the help that you need PERIOD While we wish that professors could take a more active role in students lives that friends could watch out for each other all of the time and that it was easy to spot someone who needs help it isnt always like that PERIOD

If you need help get help PERIOD There is no shame in going to speak to a counselor even if you are unsure of what is wrong and need help putting your finger on it PERIOD Mental and emotional health are as vital as physical health and there are several places on campus that you can go to keep yourself healthy PERIOD McKinley has a mental health clinic staffed with psychiatrists psychologists a clinical nurse specialist and social workers while the University Counseling Center offers individual couples and group counseling sessions on a variety of topics PERIOD If you cant get to a facility on campus consider making an appointment with the Mental Health Center of Champaign County PERIOD It serves the greater Champaign community PERIOD



There have been several suicides on this campus this calendar year  suicides that may have been preventable PERIOD Please help each other PERIOD Watch out for each other PERIOD And watch out for yourself PERIOD It may be hard to make sure you get the help you need but that first courageous step is a step toward the light PERIOD",Preventing college suicide requires vigilance - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
