A new season begins PERIOD

OSU football opens its spring football season on Tuesday PERIOD

Here are five things to follow leading up to the spring game on April  PERIOD

OSUs heavy roster turnover extends beyond players PERIOD In late January Derek Mason replaced Jim Knowles as OSUs defensive coordinator PERIOD Known for using a speedy pass rush heavy defense Masons system bodes well for OSU PERIOD Masons development skills will be tested with seven defensive starters lost to the transfer portal and NFL draft PERIOD



Losing several secondary stars to the NFL and transfer portal results in opportunities for others PERIOD Replacing the productivity of linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez will be nearly impossible but progress can be made PERIOD A combination of veteran returners and transfers will vie for starting roles PERIOD The Cowboys added Xavier Benson a JUCO transfer linebacker PERIOD The defensive backfield returns just one starter Jason Taylor II PERIOD

A season ago running back depth was one of OSUs strengths PERIOD Entering the  season however many questions arise PERIOD OSUs top three running backs in   Jaylen Warren L.D PERIOD Brown and Dezmon Jackson moved on PERIOD Dominic Richardson a junior with  appearances will likely lead the core PERIOD Ollie Gordon a highly touted early enrollee from Fort Worth Texas will have an opportunity to impress coaches this spring PERIOD

In  wide receiver depth became a luxury for the Cowboys PERIOD Many freshmen established themselves as top options for the future PERIOD With Tay Martin OSUs No PERIOD  receiver out of eligibility the youth movement continues PERIOD Freshmen Jaden Bray and Blaine Green combined for  appearances PERIOD Brays strong ball catching abilities resulted in a solid debut season PERIOD Blaines brother Bryson and John Paul Richardson also contributed off the bench PERIOD

Riddled with injuries OSUs offensive line created a revolving door of inconsistency in recent years PERIOD The Cowboys return three starters but lost Josh Sills a mauling force on the line to graduation PERIOD Four reserves transferred out resulting in a lack of depth within the unit PERIOD The Cowboys added Tyrone Webber a highend JUCO recruit PERIOD Caleb Etienne a massive JUCO transfer remains a question mark PERIOD Despite an abundance of potential Etienne struggled with the adjustment to Division  football and sparsely appeared in three games PERIOD
