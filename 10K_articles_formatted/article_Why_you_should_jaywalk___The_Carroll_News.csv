The dreaded BelvoirSilsbyWrenford intersection PERIOD

There is a cartoon I think about a lot when I walk I promise this isnt another walking columnokaymaybe just a little PERIOD It reimagines a city block  pedestrians lining the sidewalks a woman walking her dog shimmering storefront windows  except that the roads are replaced with thousand foot crevices and the crosswalks with pirateshiplike planks PERIOD

Sure the metaphor is a bit on the nose but I think the point the cartoon is getting at is valuable roads are endless networks of space dangerous to human beings PERIOD

Ive encountered this viscerally in the neighborhood around John Carroll PERIOD

Take for instance the hellscape that is the BelvoirSilsbyWrenford intersection PERIOD A block north of Campion Hall I frequently cross this intersection on walks PERIOD If I am heading south from Pervis Park down Wrenford Road to continue on the same street I need to cross lanes of traffic three times while watching out for cars from six possible directions PERIOD

When the intersection is busy it is often impossible to decipher when it is my turn to cross so I usually just wait for a brief lull say a Hail Mary walk on into the street and keep my head on a swivel poised to athletically dodge any oncoming motorists I may have missed PERIOD

The worst part of this for the quality of my walk is that it breaks the flow PERIOD If Im deep into a song or a podcast I have to pause it to focus on not getting flattened by the omnidirectional threat of wheeled death machines PERIOD If Im having an interesting thought I invariably have lost my place by the time I reemerge from the other side of the asphalt no mans land PERIOD And if Im walking with a friend our conversation lulls as we stop to coordinate our simultaneous crossing PERIOD Roads break my stride if you will PERIOD

Not only do roads kill creativity they destroy community and they inspire individualism PERIOD For instance to walk to my neighbors house which is probably about  feet directly across the street I have to spend a solid three minutes walking down the street to enter the crosswalk and then back down the street to their house PERIOD Instead of simply taking  seconds to just walk across the street I have to waste my time using this narrow governmentapproved strip of pavement  the only place where I may legally cross the street PERIOD Talk about government overreach PERIOD

And for what So some antisocial freak can zoom his tintedwindow Subaru down the street at  miles per hour any time he pleases

And if you think Im being pedantic here if you think Im making mountains out of molehills if you think that no one actually enforces jaywalking laws let me tell you about my freshman year living in Campion Hall PERIOD Anyone who lived there that year will surely recall the brief period when University Heights Police Department decided that theyd play Road Secret Police PERIOD

As you know Campion and Hamlin halls sit just adjacent to the rest of campus separated by Belvoir Road PERIOD So to get to campus you have to cross a stoplight controlled intersection PERIOD

For about a month a black UHPD squad car would intermittentlysit by the crosswalk stopping students who illegally crossed the street and ticketing them PERIOD A friend on my floor got slammed with a  ticket for crossing a street PERIOD

Today cars own the streets not people and there is an entire legal regime in place to make sure it stays that way PERIOD

And the worst part is that it wasnt always like this PERIOD Prior to the ubiquity of the automobile city streets were a gathering space PERIOD Kids played in the streets adults talked and traded with each other communities formed PERIOD

But as cars began flying down city streets in the early twentieth century pedestrianinvolved accidents increased at alarming rates PERIOD The first impulse of cities was sensibly to crack down on the cars PERIOD In  Cincinnati for instance attempted to require that all cars in the city be equipped with a mechanical governor limiting their speed to  miles per hour PERIOD

Unsurprisingly this spooked the nascent automobile industry PERIOD They successfully lobbied against Cincinnatis proposed speed limit and then they embarked on a national campaign to shame jaywalkers. they took out ads mocking jaywalks held events promoting street safety and most importantly lobbied to criminalize crossing the street incorrectly PERIOD In doing so they pulled off historys largest if slowest heist PERIOD They manipulated the public consciousness turning roads from a place for people into a place for cars They stole the streets PERIOD

The scars from the crime are still visible in cities to this day PERIOD Across the country bustling early twentieth century neighborhoods with shops and apartments and restaurants and bars were leveled for the construction of highways PERIOD

Heartbreaking sidebysides like the one below show the extent of the wounds and I dont use heartbreaking likely PERIOD When I look at pictures like this I see the decades of communities that never were of neighbors that never were of friendships that never were PERIOD All that culture and community sacrificed to the industrial spirit of Ford Motor Company PERIOD



And sure there was some transitory benefit in all this PERIOD The ease of automobile transportation and the suburban boom cars kicked off surely drove a large amount of economic activity PERIOD But I wonder what that boom would have looked like driven instead by a massive investment in public transportation Would it not have been of comparable size

Most of all though I wonder what this country would be like if we didnt carve up our communities with asphalt and concrete PERIOD

I wonder if wed be less individualistic walking or taking the train instead of hiding behind tinted windows interacting with fellow drivers only to honk or flip each other off PERIOD I wonder if we would be less antisocial conversing not on the acrid online public squares of Twitter and Facebook but instead in physical public spaces just beyond our front door PERIOD I wonder if wed love our communities more travelling together and not alone PERIOD

Most of this carfree vision is probably just a utopia existing only in my naive young collegestudent mind PERIOD But if our communities looked just onetenth more like that utopia than this world I think wed be much better off PERIOD

But it is not too late to start building utopia PERIOD For most of human civilization roads were occupied by people the automobilization of roads is a relatively recent development PERIOD And if COVID showed us anything about roads it is that the cars ownership over them is fragile PERIOD As restaurants struggled with new limited capacities cities began allowing establishments to set up shop in the streets or in parking lots a glorious repurposing of that ugly pavement PERIOD My home city of Chicago even closed down a busy downtown section of Clark Street to make room for outdoor dining PERIOD

Even more radically a campaign in Berlin to create a massive carfree zone  a zone larger than the entire city of Chicago  has gained traction recently PERIOD These developments make clear that cars own the streets only so long as we allow them to PERIOD

So pedestrians Cross the street however you please play a game of street hockey throw an impromptu block party barbeque in the middle of the street PERIOD They cant stop us all PERIOD

Walkers of the world unite we have nothing to lose but our crosswalks
