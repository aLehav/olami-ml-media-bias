On Wednesday Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students Anne Ehrlich followed up on her Monday email regarding students being video recorded by a hidden phone in a bathroom at a Sigma Alpha Epsilon SAE party PERIOD

In her previous email Ehrlich encouraged students who used the firstfloor singleoccupant bathroom at the SAE party on Saturday Oct PERIOD  to contact Faith Biesecker in Campus Safety. ehrlich acknowledged in her followup email that some students had concerns about connecting with Campus Safety regarding the incident PERIOD

I have since learned that some students may be reluctant to contact Campus Safety due to concerns about being charged with a violation of the Colleges alcohol or marijuana policy said Ehrlich PERIOD I write today to reassure you that the Colleges amnesty policy applies here. ehrlich then shared the Colleges amnesty policy The College will not pursue a conduct process against any person for the possession of alcohol or marijuana for personal use when the possession is revealed in the course of a good faith report of violence hazing bullying bias harassment or intimidation PERIOD Amnesty applies to both the person for whom assistance is sought and for the person seeking assistance. ehrlich urged students who may not have reached out to Faith Biesecker due to concerns about getting in trouble to consider doing so PERIOD
