The  began its concert with TV static as if the audience was tuning to the correct station PERIOD Once the static turned to a soft violet glow The  began PERIOD

The band played at  p.m PERIOD Friday at the State Farm Center which is hosting three sequential concerts as part of its Grand Reopening after two years of renovations PERIOD The  is on its largest North American tour after releasing the album I like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it in February PERIOD

The album has a selfaware focus commenting on the duality of fame and responding to the personal issues with drugs and relationships introduced in The 1975s selftitled  album PERIOD The inclusion of a television motif made the theme of constant performance even more pointed PERIOD

The nearly full half of the stadium was on its feet for the first song Love Me. frontman Matty Healey encouraged the crowd the sing along from the start as he strutted loosely across the stage and onto platforms that brought him closer to the audience PERIOD

The second track UGH gave the audience its first taste of the intricate effects that accompanied the show PERIOD The large backdrop and four rectangular columns toward the back of the stage synchronized to show a black and white scene of New York City at night PERIOD



The band took full advantage of the State Farm Centers size and effects capacity to enhance its personal tracks with impressive visuals PERIOD This was put to especially good use during the calmer instrumental song Please Be Naked. black and white waves inched down from the top of the backdrop until it reached the columns surrounding the band with flowing waves before plunging underneath the water PERIOD The band and audience seemed to sink slowly into the teal water until a spot of sunlight faded away PERIOD For an entirely instrumental song that does not encourage dancing the sequence engaged the audience in a fitting and impressive way PERIOD

Midway through the set Healey paused to talk to the audience thanking them for letting the band play older songs PERIOD He shifted focus a more serious topic politics PERIOD

The  is based in Manchester England and Healey brought up Brexit the June referendum in which  percent of British citizens voted to leave the European Union PERIOD

We fed everything up properly he said PERIOD We expected an older generation to make the right decision. he added that even though going to concert is a way to escape everything stressful going on in the world he wanted to take the opportunity to reach out to his younger audience PERIOD

Youre teetering on the edge of a very very very very fed up situation he said PERIOD Trust me you have to fing vote. his brief speech was met with a round of applause from the audience PERIOD He then encouraged compassion and launched into the song Loving Someone. as a performer Healey seems comfortable on stage interacting with the audience in a personal way by seeming to casually chat through the lyrics PERIOD The elaborate light show full band  including a saxophone player  has the potential to be excessive or over the top but Healeys looselimbed dancing and interaction with the audience grounded the act PERIOD

He is the most wellknown member of the band partially because of his heartthrob status  directing an extra baby to the front row almost drowned out the music with screaming PERIOD However he was quick to direct attention to other members of the band particularly during instrumental solos PERIOD

A little over an hour into the 90minute set the band exited to immediate cheers for an encore PERIOD The  did not disappoint quickly returning to the stage with a backdrop with an aerial view of Los Angeles at night PERIOD

Rather than an encore it was more like a second act filled with higher energy tracks and intense brighter lighting PERIOD

During If I Believe You which explores Healeys experience with religion and atheism he climbed onto a platform to wildly direct an extended saxophone solo PERIOD He was silhouetted in white from the backdrop as he emphatically waved his arms like a combination of a conductor and a preacher leading a sermon PERIOD He held what appeared to be a cigarette in place of a baton PERIOD

The band finished the set with some of their top hits Girls Chocolate and The Sound. the audience jumped in sync as the band played additional choruses to keep the show going PERIOD

When The  exited the stage the light effects continued to play reverting to a pinktinged static and wavy rainbow bars as if the connection was being lost PERIOD The backdrop image contracted into a single point of light and the TV was turned off PERIOD
