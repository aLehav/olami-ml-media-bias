Markus Howard got a lot of shots up early going 5for13 in the first half with  points PERIOD Sacar Anim joined Howard in double figures with fewer shots as he was 5for7 from the field with  points PERIOD

Brendan Bailey and Jayce Johnson also both contributed on the offensive end as Bailey had seven points and Johnson scored six in the paint PERIOD Koby McEwen did not score in the first but added six assists and three rebounds PERIOD

Despite the lead the Golden Eagles faced the issue of foul trouble going into halftime as both of their bigs in Johnson and Theo John as well as Howard all had two fouls PERIOD

Going into the second half foul trouble continued to be a problem as with just under  minutes left in the game John picked up his fourth and Johnson picked up his third PERIOD

Johnson fouled out of the game with under two minutes left and finished with eight points and seven rebounds in  minutes off the bench PERIOD John did not foul out and finished with six points and five rebounds PERIOD

Georgetown had to worry about its own foul trouble as their star big in Yurtseven got three quick fouls in the second half and picked up a fourth later on forcing him to sit more than he expected to down the stretch PERIOD

From there the Hoyas intentionally fouled and Marquette was able to knock down the free throws to close out the game despite the team going just 14of20 from the freethrow line including four uncharacteristic misses from the line for Markus Howard PERIOD
