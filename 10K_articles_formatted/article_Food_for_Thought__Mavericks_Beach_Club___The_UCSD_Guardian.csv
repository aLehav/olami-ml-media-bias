6217,2023-10-08,"i hope you are in the mood for a sizzling and slightly salty review because that is todays house special.On April  a friend and I went to Mavericks Beach Club in Pacific Beach to get a taste of the food and the establishment PERIOD It is an allages venue by day but transforms into a 21andup crowd at night catering well to people in their  and 30s PERIOD The restaurant boasts an extensive 15000squarefeet area PERIOD Five bars make up the entire restaurant and club and each bar area serves a unique purpose PERIOD One area has an ocean view another has an indoor area for private parties and the other areas are outdoors PERIOD Depending on which area you go to you can experience a causal businesslike or playful atmosphere PERIOD With both indoor and outdoor space  TVs plenty of seating areas a fire pit couchespurse hooks under the tables and even a rooftop bike valet Mavericks has thought of everything PERIOD I have to say its efficient and functional use of every bit of space is impressive PERIOD Additionally they have a calm but fun beach theme throughout the club shown through artwork on the walls pictures on the tables coolers along the bars indie pop music and overall design PERIOD It creates a clean and refreshing ambiance PERIOD



Now on to the delicious details PERIOD Mavericks has a simple and easytounderstand menu PERIOD With classic American and Mexican dishes such as California fries tacos burritos wings tostadas and tortas the menu variety is not outstanding but it serves its purpose for the barclub setting PERIOD The snacksappetizers range from  to  PERIOD The main menu dishes range from  to over  depending on the addons you choose PERIOD Based on how much food you get the prices are very reasonable PERIOD

First I will be discussing the appetizers or snacks as the club labels them PERIOD My friend and I ordered the Puffy Tacos and Wahoo Tostadas which came with a mild salsa and lime wedges PERIOD Once the dishes arrived my first impression was that they are a fairly large snacks each came with three tacos or tostadas each making them actually a decent meal size PERIOD The presentation of the dishes was clean despite the fact that the

dish itself was loaded PERIOD The tacos were a favorite of mine PERIOD Because they were puffy they held their shape when you bit into them instead of just falling apart PERIOD The only minor downside to this is that the bottom of the tacos were slightly soggy but the flavor of the tacos was so good that I did not really mind PERIOD They were savory juicy not overly salty and not too heavy PERIOD Next the tostadas PERIOD I found this dish to be a messy eat however the flavors of the corn tortilla and the lime crema were a shining redemption PERIOD The overall taste of the dish was not as flavorful as the tacos but it was not at all bland just lighter PERIOD Also the addition of crispy leeks on the top of the tostadas was seemingly minor but truly made a difference having the crunch of the tostada on the bottom then the chewiness of the chicken the softness of the tomatoes and avocados and then the final slight crunch of the fried leeks on top was a textural success PERIOD I also feel as if I should mention the salsa PERIOD At first I thought it was more of a sauce than a salsa PERIOD In all honesty it tasted like marinara sauce with lime juice and a pinch of spice PERIOD Not only was the taste strange but it did not compliment the dishes well PERIOD

Moving on to the main dishes I ordered a shrimp torta with guacamole and fajita veggies PERIOD The presentation was simple The sandwich split into two and held together with skewerlike sticks with the same previously mentioned salsa PERIOD This precaution did not make eating the torta any easier though PERIOD The sandwich was quite soggy on the bottom and was too flimsy PERIOD Adding to that the flavor just was not there PERIOD I expected the shrimp to have more of a kick to it because I could smell some nice seasoning but it was lost in translation.The ingredients themselves were high quality but overall it tasted like a cheesy bread sandwich with some unseasoned shrimp and fajita veggies and guacamole PERIOD My friend ordered a carnitas burrito which came with chips and salsa PERIOD It continued the trend of subtler flavors despite high quality ingredients PERIOD The burrito had carnitas beans rice cheese pico and pineapple salsa which was better than the standard salsa PERIOD The addition of the pineapple salsa was a unique twist to the traditional dish PERIOD Its sour and sweet flavor complimented the simple ingredient list PERIOD

Mavericks Beach Club has put an incredible amount of thought into its space and decoration but I wish it would put more of an effort into its menu PERIOD On one hand there are the snacks which are delectable and fun PERIOD I highly recommend trying the Puffy Tacos and Wahoo Tostadas PERIOD On the other hand the actual main dishes leave room for more to be desired PERIOD Also the space is very welcoming and casual but also fun and exciting PERIOD In conclusion I would definitely go back to Mavericks for the snacks and if the beachy feelgood vibe and good food are not enough to convince you it is also dog friendly
