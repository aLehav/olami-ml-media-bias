The most poignant type of betrayal is when youre really jiving with someone and you proceed to find out that they like to eat green bananas PERIOD

There are more than  different types of bananas PERIOD The fruit is grown in more than  countries and though the cavendish is most common bananas are divided into more than  individual groups PERIOD There are two ways to peel the fruit  like a monkey from the bottom or like a human from the top PERIOD

But theres only one ideal ripeness PERIOD And its a radiant sunshine shade of yellow PERIOD

Bananas take about four days to transition from green to yellow PERIOD Then they stay ripe  which is to say a solid yellow  for about two days PERIOD When bananas are yellow theyre easiest to digest PERIOD And the riper the fruit is the higher in antioxidant level it is PERIOD Antioxidants are correlated with the reduction of disease and they can reduce the damage to the body caused by oxidation PERIOD Some might say antioxidants protect the body guide the body towards sustenance like a patron saint PERIOD O holy yellow banana PERIOD

And if you dont eat your bananas in this three to four day timeframe you can just let them become overripe and brown and then eat them anyway because brown bananas still taste far better than green bananas PERIOD Soft mush is better than a block of starch which is the green banana PERIOD And if they ripen too quickly you can freeze brown bananas and use them to sweeten oatmeal or make banana bread PERIOD

One simply cannot make banana bread with green bananas and this is one of the reasons why green bananas are at the bottom of the banana hierarchy  ringing in just above last place which goes to the moldy banana PERIOD If you do know someone who likes to make their banana bread with green bananas watch them carefully  they probably dont yawn when other people yawn PERIOD

Its true that green bananas are bursting with riches in a way that yellow bananas are not PERIOD They have higher levels of resistant starch and pectin PERIOD But they also taste like kale sprinkled with stevia which is fine if you want to eat kale sprinkled with stevia but if youre eating a banana then you probably want to just be eating a banana PERIOD Green bananas are far harder to digest and often have the tendency to cause gas and bloating which nobody wants PERIOD If they do want this they might also not yawn while other people yawn PERIOD

And as if the looming threat of gas and bitter taste isnt bad enough green bananas also stick to your tongue like candle wax and they make a weird uncomfortable crunchy sound while being peeled PERIOD One might choose to compare said sound with the word moist  its simply aversive PERIOD

Here at The Pitt News were all for going green PERIOD Except for when it comes to bananas PERIOD
