An unassuming storefront on First Avenue gives way to the lively and fragrant atmosphere of new East Village restaurant The Tang a contemporary noodle bar that draws on the traditional roots of its owners two of whom are current CAS senior Yu Li and SPS alum Eric Sze PERIOD The Tang which opened its doors on July  has seen a welldeserved positive reaction from the community boasting four stars on Yelp and almost  followers on Instagram PERIOD

Sze the chef explained that the restaurant is still in its early stages PERIOD

We have our slow days we have hectic days Sze said PERIOD Were really pretty much still trying to figure things out PERIOD But today versus three months ago things are definitely easier. the Tang despite its newness knows what it wants to achieve a balance between modernity and tradition PERIOD Authentic flavor with a modern New York twist is its manifesto PERIOD Li who manages the restaurants operations came up with the original concept for the noodle bar PERIOD

I had a favorite noodle shop back in Beijing close to my home Li said PERIOD They had just introduced the steamed noodles PERIOD I wanted to create something similar PERIOD Initially I wanted to open more traditional flavors like the Beijing style PERIOD Then I reached out to Sze and we decided to create a more contemporary noodle shop so came The Tang. this contemporary and traditional mix is wellestablished through The Tangs menu PERIOD The pork belly string bean steamed noodles are a bestseller at The Tang and Sze explained how he gets the powerful punch of flavor the noodles bring to the dish PERIOD A soy stock is created from string beans and ground pork and placed into a wok with raw noodles PERIOD The noodles are steamed until the stock is reduced into a sauce and then tossed in that sauce PERIOD Two pieces of rich pork belly top the dish off PERIOD The noodles are fragrant and aromatic packing in twice the flavor because of the steaming method and the sauce is rich in flavor  its a bestseller for a reason PERIOD

But as much as Sze loves the pork belly string bean steamed noodles he recommends the sizzling noodles PERIOD

Its kind of a blend of Chongqing and Sichuan Sze said PERIOD The spices are more Sichuan PERIOD I use some garlic powder and cayenne pepper kind of an homage to the American south PERIOD The chili powder itself looks like dry rub PERIOD But the technique I picked up from Xian pouring sizzling hot oil over the noodles over the spices hence sizzling noodles. running a restaurant with growing popularity is no easy feat however and finding the balance between work and school can be tough PERIOD Li who is in his last year at NYU studying computer science and economics describes his days as busy but manageable PERIOD

I go to school two full days I get off at five Li said PERIOD I come back at night check the food make sure everything is okay PERIOD I go home at  or  I squeeze a little bit of time to do my homework PERIOD Its okay I only have five more classes so Im getting there. a version of this article appeared in the Monday Oct PERIOD  print edition PERIOD Email Kaitlyn Wang at emailprotected PERIOD
