Coming off a twogame losing streak and possibly without its best player the Massachusetts mens basketball team is limping into Wednesday nights game against Atlantic  bottomfeeder Fordham PERIOD

Luwane Pipkins came out of the game against Saint Josephs on Saturday early in the second half and remains daytoday with a hamstring injury for UMass   A10 PERIOD The Minutemen remain without backup point guard Tre Wood who has been dealing with a concussion for several weeks PERIOD

I wish we had a guy that could run our team and get guys shots and get in the lane and do that but thats not the case right now coach Matt McCall said PERIOD Weve still put ourselves in position to win a lot of games but we just havent been able to get over the hump. pipkins had been struggling with his shot since the start of conference play shooting just  percent from the field in A10 games but his ability to drive the ball and kick out has opened up a lot of shots for the rest of the team PERIOD Without him the Minutemen will likely rely on redshirt sophomore Keon Clergeot who took over on the ball for the end of the game against St PERIOD Joes PERIOD

Keon did a good job in the second half although its not quoteunquote his natural position McCall said PERIOD I thought he did a good job of running our team and trying to get us into offense and do some good things for us PERIOD He brought some good energy hes trying really hard out there and we need to find a way to put him into positions where hell be successful PERIOD But whos that secondary ballhandler Thats going to be one of the challenges for us tomorrow night. uMass was already foundering in the last month losing nine of the last  en route to a  record in the conference PERIOD Since a win against Rhode Island on Jan PERIOD  the Minutemen have lost two straight a loss to La Salle in a game where UMass missed  field goals and a loss to St PERIOD Joes where the Minutemen shot  percent but turned the ball over  times PERIOD

I feel like it wasnt St PERIOD Joes it was more on us sophomore Carl Pierre said of the turnovers PERIOD We just need to slow down read the floor and make the best possible decision at all times. fordham   A10 currently the only team below UMass in the A10 would seem to be an ideal bounce back opponent but the Minutemen have already lost to St PERIOD Bonaventure La Salle twice and St PERIOD Joes three teams they were expected to beat PERIOD

The Rams have three players averaging doubledigit points  Nick Honor Antwon Portley and Jalen Cobb  but their calling card is defense PERIOD

They want you shooting 17foot jump shots and its easy to take the bait because theyre wide open McCall said PERIOD But theres a reason that youre wide open PERIOD You cant take the bait PERIOD But youve got to give them a lot of credit for that style and how they play and its very tricky to play against. the one bright spot for the UMass offense in the last two games has been fifthyear senior Rashaan Holloway who recorded a doubledouble both nights PERIOD His  points against St PERIOD Joes marked a season and careerhigh PERIOD

The end is near McCall said of Holloway PERIOD Reality starts to set in the real world is right around the corner PERIOD Bills job all of that is coming and Im proud of him that hes put himself in position to get a degree PERIOD But sometimes you get a gut check there when you see that theres only  or  practices left and 30odd days PERIOD Time is ticking. for Holloway the impending end of his college career was less of a motivation than UMass struggles as a team PERIOD

Im just worried about trying to win as many games as possible trying to do the best I can and the best we can to make something successful out of our season Holloway said PERIOD The individual stuff it really dont matter to me until we win PERIOD I could score  and we lose it really would mean nothing to me PERIOD I just want to win. tipoff against Fordham is scheduled for  p.m PERIOD in the Mullins Center PERIOD
