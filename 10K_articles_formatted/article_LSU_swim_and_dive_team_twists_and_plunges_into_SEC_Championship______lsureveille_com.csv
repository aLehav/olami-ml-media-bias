Thanks to COVID19 it was up in the air if the swim and dive program would even have a season PERIOD When it was certain that the season was set in stone many of the studentathletes anxiety was lifted PERIOD The coaches are excited to see some highlevel performances from both the womens and mens teams PERIOD

Coach Dave Geyer highlighted Brooks Curry as the top male athlete PERIOD

He had his phenomenal freshman year Geyer said PERIOD There is a lot more to him this year than last year and we are excited to see what he does. coach Doug Shaffer was excited with the amazing results that the team posted in November at the Texas Diving Invitational PERIOD Shaffer explained that the athletes who will perform well at the meet will be the ones who step up to the plate PERIOD

Shaffer explained how the team is racking up their titles PERIOD

The season is a building process and we do everything in order to be prepared Shaffer said PERIOD Just be natural and in the moment and compete for the best. juan CelayaHernandez and Anne Tuxen are the top athletes for the diving team PERIOD CelayaHernandez was named SEC male diver of the week PERIOD Tuxen performed well in the womens threemeter at the last meet PERIOD Tuxen has become very successful this year and has been training hard PERIOD

This year the SEC championship has divided its meet based on gender for both swim and dive PERIOD One of the unique aspects of the SEC meet was everyone being combined PERIOD The SEC is one of the only few who combine meets PERIOD In the past it has been an extraordinarily loud and rowdy environment of  studentathletes with all the school colors jumbled together PERIOD This SEC championship will be the complete opposite with only studentathletes allowed and no spectators PERIOD

The most difficult part about this season is the athletes not being able to communicate with one another during practice because of COVID19 PERIOD There is a huge social factor that comes into play for sports and limiting that aspect is really hard for the swim and dive team PERIOD

Going into the SEC championship LSU will have advantages over other schools PERIOD The team dealt with the COVID19 restrictions correctly PERIOD As the team went through difficult times this season it allowed them to strengthen their core as a program PERIOD Other schools have struggled with this and it could be a setback for them PERIOD
