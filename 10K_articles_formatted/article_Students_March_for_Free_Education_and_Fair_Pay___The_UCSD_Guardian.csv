When UC tuition has more than tripled since  when nationwide student loan debt is . trillion when excess administrative spending is . billion when campus workers receive less than a livable salary we are forced to ask what is happening to higher education Fabella said PERIOD While demands seem extreme in the grand scheme of things students are participating in a movement to resist what is happening to higher education today. a.S PERIOD President Dominick Suvonnasupa also expressed support for the movement and said the burden of student loans needs to be addressed now more than ever PERIOD

I am extremely proud that our students are organizing to shed light on this very serious issue Suvonnasupa told the Guardian PERIOD It is time for us as students to critically examine what is going on financially in higher education PERIOD It is time for us to speak out about our lack of support and it is time for California to realize that university students are the most important investment and resource that this state has. moser commented that the UC system already strives for college affordability but the system can still improve upon its methods PERIOD

As students as the next generation of professionals and leaders we must voice our concerns even if it takes a million students Gutierrez told the Guardian PERIOD However it will take more than just a million voices it takes change in the office it takes education and a willingness to listen a willingness to let go of greed and power in order to save the education of those million PERIOD It takes a willingness to understand our struggle not by the measure of intensity but by the measure of our destiny. fabella added that the organizers decided to use the march to increase student awareness about the Black Lives Matter movement due to recent incidences of racism at the University of Missouri PERIOD

It is important not to undermine that this movement stemmed specifically from antiblack incidents and that these were struggles faced by and a fight led by black students Fabella said PERIOD We demand justice safety and solidarity for the black students in Mizzou Black Lives Matter and the prioritization of the safety and success of students of color on college campuses. students marched from the Silent Tree in front of Geisel Library down to Library Walk walked through Price Center and circled back to the Silent Tree PERIOD They chanted If education is your mission stop raising our tuition and We see students UC profits. uC StudentWorker Union San Diego Tritons for Bernie Sanders  Now San Diego Socialist Alternative at UCSD and Students for Free Tuition sponsored the rally at UCSD PERIOD Event organizers will be hosting adiscussion at Price Center next Thursday to brainstorm future rallies and steps to raise awareness PERIOD
