Updated November     pm







After a weekend of collegiate and professional football games riddled with helmettohelmet contact concussions and other head injuries the NFL has decided to take action PERIOD

The NFL announced new headprotection rules Wednesday and will hand out game suspensions for helmettohelmet contact and devastating hits starting this weekend PERIOD

This past weekend saw plenty of injuries due to helmet contact as five NFL players were treated for head injuries and one collegiate player was left paralyzed from the neck down PERIOD

The NFL has already taken action in some of the more brutal weekend hits with hefty fines handed out Tuesday PERIOD

Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson was absolutely leveled by Atlanta Falcons cornerback Dunta Robinson in Sundays matchup at Lincoln Financial Field PERIOD

The hit  a helmettohelmet collision  left both players sprawled out in pain for a few moments before both were helped off the field PERIOD Neither player returned to the game and Jackson was diagnosed with a concussion while Robinson came away with a minor head injury  and a  fine PERIOD

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison  known for his big hits and intense play  made devastating hits on Browns receivers Josh Cribbs and Mohamed Massoquoi only minutes apart from each other PERIOD

Cribbs lost consciousness for a few minutes before coming out of his cataleptic state and making his way to the sideline with help from officials and trainers PERIOD

Massoquoi was violently sent to the turf and slowly made his way off the field PERIOD

Both players would not return to action and Harrison  while not penalized on field for the hits  was fined  by the league PERIOD

Detroit Lions linebacker Zach Follett received a head injury by helmettohelmet contact while covering a kickoff in the fourth quarter of Sundays matchup against the New York Giants at New Meadowlands Stadium PERIOD

Giants defensiveend Jason PierrePaul issued the hit on Follett knocking him out of play for the remainder of the game PERIOD

In collegiate play Rutgers defensive tackle Eric LeGrand is paralyzed from the neck down after leading with his helmet on a special teams tackle PERIOD

After making initial contact LeGrand dropped to the ground seized up and was carried off the field on a stretcher PERIOD

LeGrands recovery is being monitored around the clock while he has still yet to recover from the spinal cord injury PERIOD

With pressures from the medical and scientific communities to remove helmet contact from the game and after an increase of headrelated injuries this season it has become abundantly clear to the NFL that careful yet impactful changes need to be made for the protection of players PERIOD

The NFL realizes serious psychological damages can be incurred through helmet contact now PERIOD

The league also realizes having key players removed from games due to concussions is bad for business and bad

for the entertainment value of the sport PERIOD

The NFL does not want tragedies  such as the one that occurred at Rutgers Stadium Saturday  to occur within their league PERIOD

These rules were implemented not only for the protection of players but also as a safeguard to protect the league from further scrutiny PERIOD

On the other hand the NFL is worried about the competitive nature and entertainment value of its games PERIOD

If defensive players continually take shots at gamechanging offensive playmakers  as Harrison did to Cribbs  the team who suffers the loss of said player will be at a statistical and strategic disadvantage PERIOD

The league wants to ensure its superstars are available for viewers each and every week PERIOD The NFL is a business after all and needs to continue producing the most entertaining show week in and week out PERIOD

Through rule changes and suspensions the NFL will protect its image and its players while keeping football fans on the edge of their seats PERIOD
