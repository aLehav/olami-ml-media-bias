Looking for a new way to start your day Focus on breakfast It is the most important meal of the day but eating the same thing every day can get boring quickly PERIOD Each day feels like the same as the last one in this quarantine so try to change up your diet and palate and expand into making various breakfast entrees PERIOD Each of the recipes I list will contain at the most five ingredients so it should stay in a tight budget easily and should be relatively easy to make as I am definitely not even close to someone who can cook well PERIOD



Yogurt Bark

I know this sounds a bit odd because what even is it But dont knock it till you try it For this recipe you will need the following  cups of vanilla yogurt  cup of sliced almonds  cup of fresh fruit of your choice and  cup of granola PERIOD

Youll want to grab a rimmed baking sheet and to put parchment paper on top of it PERIOD Then put the yogurt onto the pan and sprinkle in the granola and fruit PERIOD After this all you have to do is freeze it This is great for an onthego snack but can take up a good amount of room in your freezer so if you share it with your family or roommates then youll be able to finish it quickly PERIOD

Chia pudding in a mason jar

Obviously you dont have to have a mason jar to complete this recipe its just the perfect size and an easy meal to make in it

For this recipe you will need  cup of sweetened almond milk  cup chia seeds  cup of fresh fruit diced of your choosing PERIOD You can also choose to add almonds walnuts or coconut flakes to this as well but it is not required PERIOD

Take your mason jar and pour in the almond milk chia seeds and fruit and shake it all together PERIOD After allowing it to sit for  minutes youll be able to enjoy it If you want to prepare this meal as well you can mix the almond milk and chia seeds the night before and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator PERIOD Fun fact this is considered a vegan option as well PERIOD

Reeses Banana Smoothie

While this recipe doesnt include Reeses themselves it does contain chocolate and peanut butter to give you that great combination we all love PERIOD

For this recipe you will need  cup of milk of your choice can be almond oat one percent etc. tablespoons of peanut butter  tablespoons of hot cocoa mix and  cup of frozen banana sliced PERIOD

There arent many instructions to go along with this except to use a blender and to mix all of the ingredients together until blended smoothly PERIOD This is a much healthier option that can satisfy those cravings we all get for candy especially while being locked inside the house PERIOD

Peanut butter yogurt with rice cakes

I know how weird this sounds but it actually is very good PERIOD Im a super picky eater and this basic combination of a few staple breakfast foods is a great way to switch it up so youre not eating the same thing day in and day out PERIOD

For this recipe you will need  cup of vanilla greek yogurt  cup of peanut butter  cup of chocolate chips and rice cakes

All that has to be done for this recipe is to combine the ingredients PERIOD You can mix the peanut butter and yogurt all together in a bowl and then add the chocolate chips PERIOD Top each rice cake with this recipe and fill yourself up with a sweet healthy breakfast PERIOD
