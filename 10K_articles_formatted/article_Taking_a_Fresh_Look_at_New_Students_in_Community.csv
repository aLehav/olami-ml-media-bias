Somewhere between cramming my entire life into a couple of suitcases to relocate  miles away from home and the buzzing of my alarm clock this morning I grew up PERIOD I cant put my finger on the moment this personal revolution took place but it did PERIOD And it happened without any conscious effort on my part without any consent or premeditation PERIOD Maybe it was during the surreal moment when I met and hugged my new roommate for the first time or maybe it was when I was forced to actually unpack all the pieces that collectively made up my existence after almost a week of being here PERIOD Im not saying that as the most green member of the Georgetown community I already have everything about life on the Hilltop figured out but I definitely feel distinctly different PERIOD We all do PERIOD You can see it in our faces PERIOD And if you cant its just because were trying so hard to mask it PERIOD
Coming to college is more than moving shoes and photographs PERIOD Its reconfiguring to an entirely new mold PERIOD Dont get me wrong Im not claiming everyone needs to just drop everything and assimilate already but the distinctive pieces we each bring will help to make this place into the whole it is constantly becoming PERIOD So what if were all from different points of origin we all have the same destination and now we share one distinctive common existence PERIOD And if nothing else we all began from the same position were lowly newbies who just carted a whole bunch of stuff into rooms that are way too small to share with another human being PERIOD
After Mom and Dad got teary as we said goodbye fine I cried too then flew back across North America to return to everything I had left behind reality set in PERIOD And now I know that I am truly home PERIOD Albeit this isnt home in the same sense that Ive known for my  years thus far but its home all the same PERIOD Its just a change of address right So what if dude isnt a formal salutation here Assimilation of each others slang is just the beginning of the bonds yet to be formed PERIOD Hey I can learn how to flip up the collars on my polo shirts how hard can that be Its all part of the same journey that we embark upon together PERIOD And being a freshman isnt that bad  except for the freshman stigmas PERIOD Maybe someone will pull the fire alarm someone will get lost and wander into your class someone will puke Linda Blair style at a party someone will pose as an upper classman and yes someone will even sleep through convocation PERIOD I know that sometimes we might look silly like when we seem unable to enter any event without  or so of our closest friends but maybe theyre just the only people weve met so far PERIOD Realizing that you are living so far away from home and suddenly having so much freedom can be like being thrown naked into a frozen lake PERIOD I know that every upperclassman remembers that initial chill of fear that shot down their collective spines at the prospect of going out for the first time PERIOD What you mean you want to like go to a party But I am supremely confident that this too will pass PERIOD I look forward to the day when I can preside over a great many social gatherings PERIOD But until that day I think that reading for Euro Civ PERIOD and managing the many newly budding relationships will keep me plenty busy PERIOD
Here I sit poised on the cusp between mastery of the challenge of setting up a space for me in such a novel setting and the joy of finally feeling like I am beginning to have somewhere to belong here PERIOD I can feel some piece of invisible internal machinery has clicked into gear PERIOD As if I have somehow been programmed for this moment Ive stepped up PERIOD So maybe I did sleep through a class today and maybe I did almost break my neck the first time I stumbled down from the top of Village A on my way home to New South PERIOD Now I can locate the right stairs to the classrooms in White Gravenor I can scan a crowded cafeteria almost effortlessly for someone I know I can make it to class on time I can avoid the particularly belligerent squirrels that stake out Copley Lawn and most importantly I can conduct myself with poise and a sense of humor when I mess up PERIOD Hey go easy on me here  I am still learning PERIOD
