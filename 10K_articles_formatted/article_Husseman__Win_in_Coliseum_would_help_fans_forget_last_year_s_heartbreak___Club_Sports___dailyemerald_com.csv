7638,1970-01-01,"i think I have discovered the major source of rage for the Oregon football fan PERIOD

It has nothing to do with defense outofconference scheduling or the Bowl Championship Series polls PERIOD Computer rankings and Nick Aliotti can live free to see another day PERIOD They all have nothing on the subject that draws the ire of the most ardent Duck PERIOD

Last year PERIOD

Specifically losses to Boise State Stanford and Ohio State PERIOD The offseason turmoil also factors in but Oregon fans feel as though they and their favorite team are being judged  perhaps not unfairly  on those three games PERIOD A level of catharsis was achieved when the Ducks beat Stanford on Sept PERIOD  but closure wont likely be reached unless all three losses are avenged PERIOD

Boise State is the BCS No PERIOD  team and the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls No PERIOD  team Ohio State has one loss to Wisconsin but remains a threat to win the Big Ten Conference PERIOD Oregon may yet have its revenge in this season or the next PERIOD

So far the Ducks are  for the first time since   Pac10 Conference and the AP No PERIOD  team for the first time since ever PERIOD The BCS has them No PERIOD  to Auburn but the BCS also doesnt factor in until the end of the regular season PERIOD Put simply this season is remarkable for so many different reasons and the sky remains the limit PERIOD

On the other side of this weeks matchup is the ultimate spoiler  USC playing for a bowl bid it cannot accept hoping to impress coaches that cannot vote for it PERIOD The Pac10 gold standard of the last decade hopes to take a cue from Richard Pryor and tell the Ducks that it aint dead yet PERIOD

Last year Oregon defeated USC  on Halloween night in what may be one of the best games ever held at Autzen Stadium PERIOD The atmosphere was so electric it could have powered the state for a week PERIOD Most importantly the Ducks showed up as the better team and proved their worth PERIOD

Last year last year last year PERIOD This year Oregon has to go to the Coliseum ignore ESPN College GameDays presence in Los Angeles and prove it deserves its place at the head of the table PERIOD And this year it has a good chance of doing so PERIOD

This years Oregon team is better than last years PERIOD

Statistically the Ducks make a case for themselves well PERIOD They lead the nation in total offense . yards per game and scoring offense . points per game ahead of last years numbers . yards and . points per game respectively PERIOD Even the numbers for total defense . vs PERIOD . and scoring defense . vs PERIOD . are ahead from last season PERIOD

The most compelling reason as to why this team is better is not just an added year of experience and some improvement from key players like Jeff Maehl and Eddie Pleasant PERIOD Rather its the work of one man PERIOD His name is not David Paulson  though I chuckle every time at the Fight Club allusion  but Darron Thomas PERIOD

His averages this season are slightly better than Jeremiah Masolis we can still say that name in this paper right but his command of the offense somehow seems better PERIOD Thomas is a legitimate pocket presence and appears to have impressed Chip Kelly with his ability to make decisions and make his reads PERIOD He is not overly physical but seems to know when to avoid or take contact and how to do it PERIOD

Thomas has been playing smart football and expertly captaining the Oregon offense to a higher plane of efficiency PERIOD His teammates trust him and rely on him to the necessary extent PERIOD This week he was named a semifinalist for the Davey OBrien Award given to the nations top quarterback and a darkhorse Heisman Trophy contender so the national eyes are aware of his contributions PERIOD

Want a key to the USC game Thomas needs to be as ruthlessly efficient as he was against UCLA leading Oregon to scoring drives on its first six possessions PERIOD The Trojans have not seen an offense this fastpaced this season and do not have the depth to counter the Ducks reserves PERIOD USC has allowed  of its  points ceded to opponents this season in the fourth quarter more than the other three PERIOD

Wear the Trojans down early  and beat them down mentally  and Oregon should be able to win PERIOD

The  start would equal the best in school history and a date with the Washington Huskies in Autzen Stadium  one last crack at Jake Locker  is the reward PERIOD Thomas play can make last year a distant fading memory PERIOD
