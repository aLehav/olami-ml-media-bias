With one out in the bottom of the eighth inning Sundays outcome looked promising for the Michigan baseball team PERIOD Junior centerfielder Jackson Glines the Wolverines best hitter was at bat with the bases loaded PERIOD Down just  a lead was in sight PERIOD

But Glines grounded into a double play to end the inning leaving the Wolverines in disbelief PERIOD Sophomore shortstop Travis Maezes stared into the dugout PERIOD Sophomore third baseman Jacob Cronenworth squatted looking down into the turf PERIOD Freshman catcher Harrison Wenson had his hand on his hips staring up in the sky PERIOD They all knew the opportunity was there but nothing came of it PERIOD

A day after tallying  hits Michigan couldnt find enough offense on Sunday losing to Minnesota  PERIOD

Michigan  Big Ten  overall started the days scoring when junior first baseman Kyle Jusick led off the second inning with a double to rightcenter field and scored on freshman left fielder Carmen Benedettis sacrifice fly PERIOD

Minnesota   responded in odd fashion PERIOD With two outs in the third inning junior lefthander Trent Szkutnik struck out Dan Motl but a dropped third strike and a throwing error by Wenson left Motl in scoring position PERIOD He scored on the next play PERIOD

It appeared that Wenson initially tagged Motl as he reacted oddly to the umpires no call on what appeared to be a routine dropped third strike PERIOD

I didnt have a great view but I was just going off of Wensons reaction said Michigan coach Erik Bakich PERIOD I think Harrison probably got him PERIOD

Weve just got to learn from it PERIOD Weve got to be tough enough to where we can overcome that and not exacerbate the situation and give a twoout hit PERIOD Its just a free run. the Golden Gophers took their momentum to the fourth inning scoring two runs off a groundrule double and an RBI single PERIOD

Aside from Jusicks double Michigan couldnt find any timely hitting PERIOD Minnesota forced four  innings and the Wolverines failed to provide any run support PERIOD

Szkutnik entered the game  a meager record at face value PERIOD But it certainly isnt representative of how dominant he has pitched PERIOD With eight MLB scouts watching his outing the junior threw six innings on Sunday allowing just two earned runs while punching out five PERIOD

Szkutnik gave us a chance to win and we didnt get it done behind him Bakich said PERIOD

Perhaps the most impressive part of Szkutniks day was not succumbing to the pressure of scouts PERIOD

It used to make me nervous Szkutnik said PERIOD But youve got to analyze yourself PERIOD Thinking about that  will that help you win The team win It doesnt. minnesotas strong defense though proved to be too much to overcome despite Szkutniks performance PERIOD In the fifth inning senior catcher Cole Martin was thrown out by the right fielder attempting to take third on a Benedetti single PERIOD

The Golden Gophers outfield stayed consistent with Motl robbing a Maezes line drive to center in the same inning PERIOD

Michigan showed glimpses of being a Big Ten contender this weekend but it must fix its inconsistencies if it has any hope of making a splash in the conference PERIOD

What happened Friday PERIOD

Cronenworth allowed three runs in a blown save including one on a walk in the 11thinning of the Wolverines  loss to Minnesota PERIOD

We dug ourselves a pretty good hole a couple of times Bakich said PERIOD When you have a chance to win the game you win the game PERIOD Otherwise you let the other team hang around and then they take advantage of an opportunity to stay in the game and score runs. the blame though couldnt solely be pinned on Cronenworth PERIOD Senior righthander Ben Ballantine struggled to find any rhythm throwing  pitches in three innings while allowing four hits and a run PERIOD

Michigan got down early  but came back firing eventually evening the game at six to go into extra innings PERIOD

But once again the bats became anemic and Minnesota tallied three runs for the win PERIOD

What happened Saturday PERIOD

Michigan combined hot bats with nearperfect pitching to even the series with Minnesota PERIOD

The Wolverines looked to change the weekends momentum and they did just that in an  win PERIOD

Sophomore lefthander Evan Hill was the catalyst behind Michigans success throwing . scoreless innings in dominant fashion PERIOD He finished the game with four strikeouts PERIOD

Freshman outfielder Jackson Lamb gave Hill all the run support he needed hitting a tworun home run to leftcenter field  the first home run at Ray Fisher Stadium this season PERIOD
