Although Buena Vista University BVU offers a multitude of volunteering opportunities a group of University Seminar students took it upon themselves to come up with their own way to make a difference PERIOD Associate Professor of Digital Media Jamii Claiborne challenged her University Seminar class of  students to come up with a service project PERIOD

The class knew that they wanted to have some type of fundraiser that would raise money for a nonprofit organization PERIOD The students then began to generate different ideas on how they would raise money and how the money would be used PERIOD They decided that they wanted to relate their fundraising efforts to the book Left to Tell which was the summer reading for all first year students at BVU PERIOD

Immaculee Ilibagiza the author of Left to Tell has an organization called the Left to Tell Charitable Fund PERIOD This fund assists Rwandan children with educational needs by providing scholarships PERIOD These scholarships help fund school fees clothing and materials PERIOD Claibornes class chose to raise  dollars for the organization  PERIOD With this money the students would be providing one student with a scholarship PERIOD

Claibornes students decided to make spirit baskets comprised of BVU spirit wear that would be raffled off through tickets PERIOD They went around campus asking for donations to contribute to the baskets PERIOD

The students originally wanted to make one or two baskets but we ended up making three and they were stuffed Claiborne said PERIOD

They then split up into three teams a sales team marketing team and basketmaking team PERIOD The sales group was in charge of figuring out how much they would sell tickets for and where and when they would sell the tickets PERIOD The marketing group was in charge of advertising the fundraiser PERIOD They made posters and advertised in places such as BVU News PERIOD The basket making team was in charge of buying the basket making materials and putting the baskets together PERIOD Tickets were then sold during lunch and supper hours in front of the Centennial Room and through individuals in the class PERIOD The class ended up exceeding their goal of  through the generous support of many people on campus with a final total of  PERIOD

We owe a lot of thanks to the student body faculty for going out their way for the cause freshman Adam Ullerich said PERIOD

The class not only learned a lot about organization and planning but they were also able to bond with one another PERIOD

I couldnt be more proud of them Claiborne said PERIOD I was really proud of the energy and commitment they put into the project. the group is now planning a second service project that will be based more around volunteering PERIOD

This project reminded me of how much I miss volunteering and got me excited about volunteer work Freshman Chelsey Goetz said PERIOD
