NEW YORK  Before Fridays game in the Atlantic  Tournament quarterfinals at the Barclays Center Temple star Khalif Wyatt was honored  with a trophy  for being named the Conference Player of the Year in  PERIOD

Thats about as long as the celebrations lasted for him PERIOD

The senior guard who despite averaging a leaguehigh . points per game and nearly matching it Friday with  points was effectively shut down by the UMass defense as he missed shot after shot never getting into the kind of groove hes enjoyed for the better part of the season PERIOD

Scoring  points would be considered a good game by most standards but it was a different statistic for Wyatt that glowed a little bit brighter in the Owls  loss A putrid 4for19  percent from the floor including going 2for11 from 3point range with four turnovers mixed in as well PERIOD

Temple coach Fran Dunphy said he thought his star put a little too much pressure on himself to perform PERIOD

Hes a tremendous player and he did force a few things but at some point youre saying to yourself at some point hes going to get us out of it Dunphy said PERIOD He probably did try to do a little bit too much. the Minutemen made it hard on Wyatt by not just putting one defender on him but by putting together a complete group effort to make him take tough shots and force the ball out of his hands to his lessskilled teammates PERIOD

UMass guards Freddie Riley and Chaz Williams were given the majority of the responsibility to contain Wyatt but others chipped in their help too including Raphiael Putney and Maxie Esho among others who gave cameo appearances in trying to stop one of the nations best scorers PERIOD

I think they did a pretty job defending me Wyatt said PERIOD I still think I had some good looks just couldnt put it in PERIOD Theyre a pretty good defensive team PERIOD Theyre long theyre athletic theyre strong and they play hard PERIOD You just give them a lot of credit for playing pretty solid defense. riley who has made a transformation over the course of his career to put more of a priority on his defense has been tasked time after time this season to defend the opponents best scorer PERIOD In the two teams Feb PERIOD  meeting  an  Temple win at the Mullins Center  Riley and Co PERIOD did a good job in containing Wyatt in the first half but the senior imposed his will in the second half with six 3pointers en route to the win PERIOD

On Friday though that previous first half effort was duplicated in the second half PERIOD Wyatt went just 2for11 over the final  minutes and went 1for7 from behind the arc PERIOD For the game nine of his teamhigh  points came on free throws a testament to his ability to take defenses off the dribble and draw fouls but he could never quite get in his rhythm  one that has seen him score  or more points five times this season  as the UMass defense swarmed on him and consistently altered his shots PERIOD

Riley wasnt quite ready to deem the defensive performance a finishing touch of a complete transformation but one hell try to replicate it as the Minutemen continue through the postseason PERIOD

I think the finishing touch would be ending the season on a win he said PERIOD Im just going to continue to try to play defense the best I can and try to help my team be in a position to win. after UMass victory over George Washington on Thursday night in the first round Williams was asked what his keys were for beating Temple PERIOD The short answer from Williams was guard Khalif Wyatt something far easier said than done PERIOD

But on Friday night it was done thanks in large part to his and Rileys efforts but he wasnt taking any of the credit away from Riley PERIOD Williams knows just how important his defensive prowess is for a team that lost its best perimeter defender in Jesse Morgan to injury earlier this season PERIOD

Fred is a great defender Williams said PERIOD Hes a tough cookie so he was just out there playing as hard as he can and he did a great job PERIOD For Wyatt to go 4for19 I told Fred he did a great job on him. stephen Hewitt can be reached at emailprotected and followed on Twitter stevehewitt PERIOD
