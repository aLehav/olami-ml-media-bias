By  Steve DennisSeptember  

From one champion to anotherthats the story of the NIU soccer teams week PERIOD

On Wednesday the Huskies suffered a heartbreaking loss to defending national champion Indiana University PERIOD

In the  overtime loss the controversial call that appeared to be the dagger that pierced the heart of the Huskies was best described by NIU head coach Willy Roy PERIOD

I told the line judge after the game that he was the most valuable player Roy said PERIOD He is the only one to score a goal in the game. the Huskies face the defending Big Central Soccer Conference champion Quincy College Sunday  p.m. on the Huskie Soccer Field PERIOD

The game will be a good match for us mentally Roy said PERIOD Because good teams bounce back from games like that Hoosier game. quincy is bringing its team to DeKalb with a  series lead that includes  and  wins over NIU last season PERIOD

He Quincy coach Jack Mackenzie has an excellent program Roy said PERIOD Were a decent team now too. oy said that Quincy has a new team and they both have victories over Drake University PERIOD

The Huskies will be without freshman Dusty Showers who was issued a redcard in the Hoosier match and must sit out the game according to NCAA rules PERIOD

Besides the Showers incident the Huskies are up to the challenge PERIOD

The key for us is to play our game as best as we can Roy said PERIOD Im glad were at home for this one. advertisement
