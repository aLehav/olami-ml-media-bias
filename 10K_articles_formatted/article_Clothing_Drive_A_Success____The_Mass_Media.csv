1736,2023-10-30,"in honor of Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week Tamika Burton Hunger and Homelessness coordinator for UMB MassPIRG organized an essential clothing drive for Bostons less fortunate PERIOD All those huge cardboard donation boxes planted around campus filled an entire donated UHaul truck with winter coats hats gloves scarves skirts and pants PERIOD

It was an awesome success expressed Juliette Lee campus organizer for MassPIRG PERIOD Lee who helps students organize their public concerns tallied up the heaps of clothing and awarded the Haitian American Society with a  check donated by the local YMCA for collecting the most clothing PERIOD Supplying the food for the aftermath festivities along with Burton Associates was Wits End Caf PERIOD

Success would not have been so complete without the help of other UMB groups such as the Womens Center Veteran Student Union Queer Student Union Asian Student Union Casa Latina Black Student Union the Student Senate Golden Key and ARMS PERIOD

The homeless and hungry issue of Boston is an enormous problem stated Lee Its extremely important to develop more advocacy and awareness. the clothing has been dropped off and distributed at the Long Island Shelter in Quincy PERIOD The Long Island Shelter is a relief shelter for men women and children that supplies  beds for the homeless every night of the year PERIOD

This was the first time that MassPIRG applied their energy towards a clothing drive for Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week. last year they held a Trick or Treat in order to feed those unable to buy food PERIOD Lee says catching people in the season of giving is more feasible than trying to run a clothing drive all winter long PERIOD Besides she says we are extremely busy with four other campaigns this semester. lee noted that she was extremely impressed with Burtons leadership and determination and added I think all are thankful and impressed with MassPIRG and UMB in general for supporting and organizing such energy and inspiration towards important public causes and concerns. look for other MassPIRG campaigns this semester to get organic foods on campus legislation passed to protect our public lands a voter registration drive and the Neponset River cleanup with UMB WaterWatch PERIOD
