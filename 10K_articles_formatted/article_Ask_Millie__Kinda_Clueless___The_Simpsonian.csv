Dear Kinda Clueless

I know it can be a little difficult to talk about a sensitive topic like this PERIOD Im glad youre asking questions because it can make the experience more positive for you PERIOD

Feeling comfortable with your partner is a necessity for being intimate with them PERIOD Im glad to hear that you are happy with where your relationship is right now PERIOD

Of course you want to enjoy your first time I know it can be difficult when you and your partner do not have the same level of experience when it comes to physical intimacy PERIOD

Communication is going to be what helps you the most PERIOD Do not be afraid to speak up if you want to slow things down or speed things up PERIOD Intimacy should not be painful let your partner know if you are hurting PERIOD

Sex will likely not be lifechanging PERIOD It does not have to be a major life event PERIOD It can simply be a positive experience you can share with your partner PERIOD

Before you jump in with another person you might consider what sensations you like PERIOD Get to know what feels good for your body so you can guide your boyfriend with the knowledge you have of yourself PERIOD

Talk to your partner about these feelings as well PERIOD Im sure he will want to know about your thoughts and emotions leading up to this moment PERIOD He will want you to feel comfortable as well PERIOD

Lastly try not to let yourself overthink the experience PERIOD This is one of those moments in life where you become more comfortable as you let yourself relax and be in the moment PERIOD

Yours truly

Millie
