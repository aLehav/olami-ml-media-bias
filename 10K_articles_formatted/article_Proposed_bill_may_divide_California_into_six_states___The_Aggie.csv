Tim Draper a venture capitalist from Silicon Valley is collecting approximately  signatures for a bill that would divide the State of California into six separate states PERIOD

Draper said that this measure is necessary for the state to move forward as the state government has become rusted and operates as a monopoly. according to Draper the State of California is ranked fiftieth out of  as the worst managed state in the Union PERIOD

The Forward Observer a nonpartisan consulting firm that conducted an analysis of the Six Californias ballot measure reported that the measure could cause two out of three UC students to pay outofstate tuition PERIOD Notably the analysis states that  percent of UC Davis students would be required to pay outofstate tuition under this new bill PERIOD

However only the physical boundaries of these six new states have been drawn up  if the bill were to pass  people would be appointed to consult with industry leaders on the best way to proceed according to Alexandra Klun the campaign manager of Six Californias PERIOD

While those involved with getting the bill on the ballot notably Draper and Klun believe that its important to bring up these topics others feel as though lobbying for this bill highlights issues as worse than they are and harms the image of the State of California PERIOD

Specifically the topics under discussion as Californias main issues include the prison system and the water crisis among other things according to Democratic Political Consultant Steve Maviglio PERIOD

The media attention that the proposal has drawn is damaging to Californias image as a national leader according to Joe Rodota CEO of The Forward Observer PERIOD

While most political observers feel that this bill is unlikely to pass the proposal is a signal to the state and to the country that California cannot be governed Rodota said PERIOD California hasnt failed PERIOD If people feel that something needs to change it should be locally or at the state level PERIOD Its a misguided and bad idea  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD the California experiment hasnt failed. klun believes that these conversations are one of the most important things about the bill PERIOD

We havent had a political conversation like this for awhile Klun said PERIOD A more local and centralized government will bring people to the areas that theyre making decisions about. maviglio believes that there is a less than zero chance that the bill will become reality PERIOD

This is somebodys pie in the sky idea that might be on the ballot just because hes able to write a big check Maviglio said PERIOD Thats not the way that public policy should be made. while dividing the State of California into six smaller states may be a huge task Klun pointed out that similar divisions have been made in the past in the United States PERIOD

Its definitely a big change nothing like this has been done in a couple of hundred years since the 1800s Klun said PERIOD

Economically Klun said that any upfront costs that the restructuring would encounter would be offset in the long term PERIOD

Its an investment PERIOD Put in capital in the beginning to make a long term impact Klun said PERIOD Were talking millions now versus billions saved and a better structure for the future. rodota argues that money should be spent on expanding higher education in California not dividing our current system PERIOD

Splitting up California would open up a Pandoras box Rodota said PERIOD It would be extremely costly and there would be squander trying to sort and split up the assets and liabilities of the State of California. draper said that he hopes that the bill will bring more efficient streamlined state governments choice for Californians and better representation for the people of California PERIOD

In opposition Rodota said that he only sees one good thing coming out of the proposal of the bill PERIOD

Bipartisan diverse group of Californians who speak up about a misguided proposal and reaffirm upon their commitment to building upon Californias reputation as a worldwide leader Rodota said PERIOD

The proposed bill needs to collect eight percent of the number of votes that were cast for governor during the last election approximately  to be verified by the county election officials PERIOD
