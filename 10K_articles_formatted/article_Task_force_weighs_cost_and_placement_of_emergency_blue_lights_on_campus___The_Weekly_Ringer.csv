A blue emergency light found on the front side of Bushnell Hall PERIOD  Matthew Simmons The Blue  Gray Press

In response to the high cost and important role the call boxes and lights are meant to serve a blue light task force was established in the last two years to open dialogue examine data and improve the system on campus PERIOD

Around the multiple UMW Campuses there are  emergency call boxes often referred to as blue lights PERIOD These boxes spread out in places from parking lots to elevators offer direct and instant communication to campus law enforcement PERIOD

According to UMW police Chief Michael Hall even though these boxes are not cheap to operate  they retain a  operating cost  its hard to put a value on all the benefits the boxes provide for the campus community PERIOD

The task force made up of members of the public safety team Campus IT students staff and professors looked at the blue lights and call boxes on campus to determine location and necessity PERIOD

What prompted this task force was different schools across the nation were pulling them down and Im not in favor of completely abolishing them but at the same time I looked to the community to tell me how many they need outside of what we normally see and how we could better meet the needs of our community said chief of UMW Police Michael Hall PERIOD What that task force did was evaluate those areas and say hey we dont need six blue lights in the Anderson Center parking lot lets take down two of those and repurpose them at another location where we dont have any. the rule of thumb that I like to use is to be able to see a blue light if I can see a blue light then I should be good. hall recently sent the final version of the blue light task force report to President Troy Paino PERIOD

From  to  the blue lights were used  times according to Hall PERIOD Out of those only nine calls were placed due to a verified emergency situation while  were verified fake calls and others were to test the system PERIOD

You cant quantify the investment easily in mechanisms like that cameras on campus the blue lights on campus police officers walking the campus said Hall PERIOD Is a criminal more likely to come to a campus that has a vibrant community interacting and walking with heads up paying attention to whats going on with security and police officers patrolling good lighting blue light systems properly located All these factors put together create that atmosphere that says we dont want crime here PERIOD Those are the factors that are hard to measure. despite having the blue lights the number of sexual assaults on campus has not decreased according to a recent article from The Blue  Gray Press PERIOD From  to  forcible rape remained the third most common crime on campus only behind drug and alcohol violations PERIOD There were  counts of forcible rape in   in  and  in  according to the  security report PERIOD Because most of these crimes happen in residence halls the blue lights are not accessible to these survivors when they need help PERIOD

Even in cases where intimidating situations happen outside students often use other resources PERIOD When the trespassing man approached freshman Grace Sylvia outside of Willard Hall she opted to call the campus nonemergency police even though she was outside according to a recent article from The Blue  Gray Press PERIOD

While the blue lights aim to deter criminals and offer a sense of security another resource is immediately available to all members of the campus community PERIOD The RAVE Guardian app is something Hall describes as a blue light right in your hand you can have . in addition to the  a year spent on blue lights the university spends about  on the RAVE Guardian app PERIOD However less than  percent of the campus community has the app downloaded PERIOD The app functions similarly to the boxes giving a quick way to contact law enforcement but it also allows your friends to track you and ensure your safety PERIOD

While the blue light task force is working to establish a good number of call boxes in locations that make the most sense students still have mixed feelings about the necessity and purpose of the system PERIOD

Daniel Rozzel a senior business administration major questions how useful the boxes would be in an urgent situation PERIOD

To me the blue boxes do not provide any extra degree of safety for myself PERIOD I feel as though if I was in a dangerous situation hitting the blue light and waiting in that location would be more dangerous if anything said Rozzel PERIOD

While the boxes range in age from older models featuring only the button and microphone to new models with builtin security cameras the main function stays the same to keep students safe and to deter crime PERIOD

Many of the boxes are in desolate areas and may look forgotten but each box is checked for functionality and accessibility every semester to ensure that if it is needed it will function properly according to Hall PERIOD

In addition to a physical check and test of each box to ensure the light can be seen clearly and the area surrounding the box is not overgrown a system constantly monitors connections to each box PERIOD The system issues a notification if a box loses connection or goes offline so it can be repaired quickly PERIOD

While Rozzel doesnt feel as though the boxes would provide immediate aid he does believe they should stay on campus as an extra means of informing the police a crime has occurred PERIOD

I think that they are still necessary because it is still better to know a situation has occurred PERIOD I dont think they add any level of safety to a situation as it occurs but it can definitely serve as a means of informing police that something has happened he said PERIOD

Liam Kirkpatrick a junior art history major believes there should be more blue lights and call boxes in some places PERIOD

I wish they were even more prominent because theres definitely some empty spaces in the campus where I notice I go for a while without seeing a box and thats mostly around the construction area said Kirkpatrick PERIOD Im in the fencing club so I tend to walk home by myself at night and I do have a tendency to kind of walk from one box to another because in the event someone does show up I can press the box.",Task force weighs cost and placement of emergency blue lights on campus â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
