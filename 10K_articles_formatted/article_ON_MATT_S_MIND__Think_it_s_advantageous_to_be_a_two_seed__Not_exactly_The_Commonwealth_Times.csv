What a tough year to be a No PERIOD  seed
in the NCAA Tournament PERIOD Do you know
when the last time was that all four No PERIOD
 seeds failed to make the Sweet 

Never PERIOD

After the four No PERIOD 2s escaped firstround
upsets Tennessee barely survived
a scare from Butler in the East region
and Texas skated by Miami in the South
region in the second round PERIOD Duke and
Georgetown were not as fortunate in the
West and Midwest respectively PERIOD

At first glance this seems like a case
of several majorconference teams hitting
the snooze button on the alarm of the
NCAAs PERIOD

Thats not true at all though PERIOD Davidson
which knocked off Georgetown
was ranked twenty-third in the country the day
after Selection Sunday PERIOD A school usually
could expect to earn  seed in its region
maybe as low as an  with that type of
performance  but the Wildcats are the
Midwests  seed PERIOD

Playing a top25 team in the second
round was an unfortunate matchup for
Georgetown PERIOD Especially having to take on
Stephen Curry a man who became just
the sixth player in NCAA tournament
history to score at least  points in his
first three tourney games PERIOD

Curry has been playing lights out PERIOD
After falling to Maryland in the first
round last year as a freshman Curry led
Davidson past Gonzaga and Georgetown
and for trivias sake his only other
scholarship offer came from VCU PERIOD

But how many times have all four No PERIOD
 seeds advanced to the Sweet  since
the tournament expanded to  teams
Also zero PERIOD There have been plenty of
upsets in the early rounds PERIOD

Just ask Tennessee of two years ago PERIOD
The Vols fell to upsetminded Wichita
State in the second round PERIOD They avoided
the same fate this year and for my
brackets sake will play moreinspired
basketball and advance to the Final
Four PERIOD

The math would tell you that being
a No PERIOD  seed means par is a trip to the
Elite Eight but its not that easy PERIOD West
Virginia beating Duke isnt a David
vs PERIOD Goliath at all PERIOD The Mountaineers
captured the NIT championship last
year and are a play in the Big East  a
conference that is now stronger than the
ACC from top to bottom PERIOD
