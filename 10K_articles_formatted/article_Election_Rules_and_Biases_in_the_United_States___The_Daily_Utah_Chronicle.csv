397,2023-10-23,"in the current  election Navajo voters in San Juan County are having their voting rights violated PERIOD

Prior to  there were nine different polling locations all across northern Utah for Navajo voters to cast their votes PERIOD However in the year  San Juan County switched from inperson voting to mailin only voting and closed all nine polling locations PERIOD Thinking that was an easier way for Navajo voters to cast their vote it actually ended up being a violation of their voting rights PERIOD

Navajo Nation of Human Rights says switching to mailin only voting introduces a language barrier problem into the process PERIOD Not all but some Native Americans do not understand the votebymail system because all forms are sent in English PERIOD With no way of getting help from translators as they had when in person voting was available they struggle with completing their ballots PERIOD

Shortly after Navajo voters made complaints of the mailinonly voting system three polling locations were opened and translators were brought into the locations in order to help the voters PERIOD Although three polling locations were opened Navajo voters are still fighting the issue because there are still six less locations than there were in  PERIOD This means for some voters they have to travel double sometimes even triple the distance to get to a polling location PERIOD Due to lack of transportation jobs and in some cases money some Navajo voters decided to not vote at all because it was too big of a hassle to get to these locations and even more of a hassle to try and understand the in mail voting forms PERIOD

In addition to the voting violation voter ID laws are becoming more and more complicated for people PERIOD  out of the  states are currently asking voters for some sort of ID before voting PERIOD Certain states require specific IDs which can makethe process more difficult for voters who do not already have the correct ID in their possession PERIOD Due to this requirement many voters have chosen not to votedue to the difficulty cost and time commitment required to get such an ID PERIOD

ID laws have continued to decrease the voting turnout among minorities PERIOD This is a problem because currently  or the  states have a higher percentage of nonwhite people than white people PERIOD Meaning that a large percentage of these  states are not being adequately representedin their state PERIOD White voters however are the only race that stays the same and maintains the same voting turnout regardless of what ID is required PERIOD This makes nonwhite voters feel less valued threatened and unimportant in the voting polls which can cause them to not vote at all PERIOD

The last concern this current election is facing that women are underrepresented PERIOD Although the majority of voters in the U.S PERIOD are women that is not the case in positions of power PERIOD Women are recruited far less than men are PERIOD Studies have shown that the Republican Party is where the underrepresentation is the most apparent PERIOD Women comprise about  percent of the attendees but historically about  percent of elected delegates PERIOD However it is believed that parties can change this issue PERIOD If parties begin to focus on recruiting women there will be a significant increase in womens representation PERIOD
