It was one of those days when students just started to enjoy spring but they along with faculty still crammed into a stuffy lecture hall in the Engineering Lab on Thursday to see guest lecturer Richard Clarke a national security advisor with the Bush administration PERIOD

The lecture titled The Missing Pieces of the Three twenty-first Century Wars Iraq Afghanistan and Cyberspace was part of the Sidney Topol lecture series PERIOD The event was originally scheduled for October but had to be rescheduled because Clarke who left the Bush administration in  had his hands full as a member of the Obama transition team helping the administration sculpt its security policies PERIOD

In a series of guest lectures dating back to November  Clarke is arguably the most prestigious name to date PERIOD He was appointed by President Clinton as the first coordinator for security and counterterrorism in May  and continued the position with George W PERIOD Bush PERIOD He is known for his sharp criticism of the Bush Administrations approach to counterterrorism prior to the Sept PERIOD  attacks as well as the decision to go to war in Iraq which he claims is going to get worse before it gets better. after an animated introduction Clarke delved into his first topic the war in Iraq PERIOD He spoke of a creeping revisionism that has led us to become complacent with the situation because casualties are low PERIOD He again expressed the same anger and distrust that led to his widely publicized resignation from the Bush administration in  PERIOD

George Bush lied to us Clarke declared emphatically PERIOD Dont let people say it was a good idea. clarke went on to address pundits who claim that withdrawing from Iraq will negate all the progress that has been made in the area and the over  soldiers that have lost their lives will have died in vain PERIOD

Having more Americans die there is no way to honor the Americans that have already died he said PERIOD

He also rejected claims that the United States still has a vested interest in Iraq and should remain there until we are able to establish a democracy PERIOD

Our interest in Iraq is getting the hell out of Iraq Clarke said concluding his views on the issue as defiantly as he had began PERIOD

Clarke then shifted the lecture towards the war in Afghanistan emphasizing the need cooperate with the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan in the effort to weed out terrorist organizations PERIOD He praised President Obama for walking away from what he called stubborn ideologies of past administrations by saying he is willing to talk to elements of the Taliban in an effort to make peace PERIOD

Dont stick to a policy when you know its a failure Clarke told the crowd PERIOD After concluding his insights on the dilemmas the country is facing in the Middle East his words of caution were clear If in the end of the day it doesnt work we need to walk away from it. in the third and final section of the lecture Clarke changed course to discuss the daunting potential of Americas next war PERIOD The said the enemy is more deadly elusive and harder to identify than the Taliban or AlQaeda PERIOD He said it will be in cyberspace PERIOD Clarke explained that the United States overdependence on the Internet has made them the most vulnerable country in the World to a cyber attack PERIOD He metaphorically described the countrys Internet addiction like a drug addict is addicted to crack. clarke called the surge in Web dependency the I.T PERIOD revolution comparing to the industrial revolution of the early 1900s PERIOD Nowadays everything from medical records to military intelligence reports is digitalized and susceptible to hackers in the United States and around the globe PERIOD Despite all the assurances that networks are protected any network can be penetrated and toyed with  no matter how many billions of dollars a year is spent trying to protect them PERIOD

He said more than any other country in the world the United States has embraced the blessed anarchy of the Web and has become reliant on it for practically everything PERIOD Clarke cautioned that a certain level of regulation is needed to protect the country from a harmful and virtually untraceable security breech PERIOD Clarke has expressed his concerns to government officials on the matter and suggests that sensitive information such as power grids and pentagon files should be taken out of cyberspace entirely PERIOD

Speaking in the computer science wing of the engineering lab Clarke ended his lecture by telling students that the solution to the problem will be in their hands PERIOD

For those of you studying computer science you have continued employment for the rest of the twenty-first century he said followed immediately by a strong round of applause PERIOD

After he was finishing speaking Clarke fielded  minutes of questions from an eager audience and said that he was honored and a bit surprised that his message was more important than sitting out in the sun PERIOD
