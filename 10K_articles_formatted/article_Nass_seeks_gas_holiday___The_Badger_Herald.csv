2826,2005-10-24,"a Wisconsin legislator introduced a bill into the State Assembly Thursday that would temporarily lower the price of gas in the state PERIOD

State Rep PERIOD Stephen Nass RWhitewater drafted the twopart bill which would stop the annual indexing of the gas tax and would institute a minimum 30day gas tax holiday in the state pending the approval of state government PERIOD

 Nass said in a release PERIOD 

The gas tax holiday would eliminate the . cents per gallon gas excise tax for  days PERIOD If the bill is passed by the state Legislature and receives the signature of Gov PERIOD Jim Doyle the tax holiday would become effective two weeks after Doyle signs the bill into law PERIOD

The governor would also have the option of extending the holiday an additional  days PERIOD

Nass said temporarily abolishing the gas tax could save consumers more than  million over the duration of two months PERIOD

The average price of regular unleaded gas in the state Sunday was . just two cents short of the national average of . according to the Wisconsin American Automobile Association PERIOD

The second part of the bill would permanently repeal the state gas tax indexing an automatic annual increase in the state gas tax which occurs each year on April  PERIOD This move would save consumers in the state more than  million in the next two years Nass said PERIOD

The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected this years indexing to raise the gas tax from . cents to . cents in April  PERIOD

However the bill has received criticism from many in the state who feel removing the gas tax for one to two months would cause problems for an already financially stressed state Department of Transportation which receives much of its funding from the gas tax PERIOD

State Rep PERIOD Spencer Black said though he supports the repeal of gas tax indexing he feels the moratorium on the gas tax would mar the DOTs ability to serve the transportation needs of Wisconsin residents PERIOD

 Black said PERIOD 

Black said he introduced legislation earlier this year to halt the annual indexing of the gas tax but his bill has yet to be voted on in the Legislature PERIOD

If the bill had specific remedies to recover lost funding for the DOT Black said the legislation would have more integrity PERIOD

 Black said PERIOD 

Despite this Nass said the bill is crucial to consumers and cited the support of ten other state legislators who are sponsoring it PERIOD

 Nass said PERIOD
