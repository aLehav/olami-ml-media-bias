2771,2007-10-25,"david Horowitz does not speak for Muslims PERIOD Nevertheless he has taken it upon himself to decide what is good for Muslims around the world PERIOD In his appearance on campus Monday as a part of his national IslamoFascism Awareness Week Mr PERIOD Horowitz made factually incorrect statements about Islamic concepts such as Sharia Law and also attempted to assess the religiosity of Muslims even making the outrageous statement that Osama Bin Laden is a good Muslim and follows the Quran. in addition to assessing the religiosity of Muslims Mr PERIOD Horowitz said that his appearance was for the Muslims PERIOD He also put a significant amount of blame on moderate Muslims for not speaking up PERIOD Despite this Mr PERIOD Horowitz and his organization never made any attempts to reach out to the Muslim Students Association of Madison MSA about involvement with his event PERIOD Perhaps the reason Mr PERIOD Horowitz and the organizers of this event made no attempt to reach out to MSA is because Mr PERIOD Horowitz has long attempted to discredit groups such as MSA by perpetuating the myth that they are funded by Hamas PERIOD Such allegations are absurd especially on this campus and are a hindrance to the productive conversation Mr PERIOD Horowitz is claiming to promote PERIOD It goes without saying that the MSA does not have any connection to terrorist organizations PERIOD Yet those who did organize this event made three issues their primary focus women in Islam the current state of Muslim majority countries and support for Israel PERIOD However neither Hillel the main organizational Jewish group on campus nor MSA the main organizational Muslim voice on campus cosponsored his appearance PERIOD On the contrary before Islamofascism week was even announced the two aforementioned groups along with the Lutheran Campus Center were actively engaged in building interfaith ties and promoting dialogue PERIOD On Tuesday MSA LCC and Hillel cosponsored a panel discussion on contemporary Islam PERIOD Also even before IslamoFascism Awareness Weeks inception MSA recruited speaker Jamal Badawi to come and speak next Thursday Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD at  Grainger on the topic of Jihad Holy War and Terrorism PERIOD Every year the MSA has held panels and discussions revolving around important issues such as women in Islam PERIOD If Mr PERIOD Horowitz had made any sincere attempt at outreach this campus would have realized far earlier that his presence would in fact be detrimental to the productive conversation these important issues deserve PERIOD Various groups make the claim that hosting Mr PERIOD Horowitz despite his views sparks conversation and promotes a diversity of ideas PERIOD While it is true that a diversity of ideas needs to be promoted it also assumes that students on the UW campus are incapable of organically conversing about these important topics it doesnt take a multimillion dollar campaign to promote the sifting and winnowing of ideas it takes a simple email PERIOD Reaching out and working with campus groups is cheaper and exponentially more effective PERIOD Yet no outreach attempt was made by Mr PERIOD Horowitz and those who sponsored him PERIOD We ask the campus community to engage in discussion and to work together for this universitys hallowed principle of sifting and winnowing to find truth PERIOD For this reason MSA saw no use in being among the protesters at Mr PERIOD Horowitzs talk PERIOD Finally we believe that the best way to further a productive discussion is by reaching out by creating bonds by posing hard questions PERIOD We realize this student body demands of itself a higher standard than espoused by Mr PERIOD Horowitz and we can achieve it without bringing in speakers who seek to divide rather than reach out PERIOD Safi Khaleel UW Senior Journalism Muslim Student Association emailprotected Adam Sitte UW Senior Arabic Communications Chair Muslim Student Association emailprotected
