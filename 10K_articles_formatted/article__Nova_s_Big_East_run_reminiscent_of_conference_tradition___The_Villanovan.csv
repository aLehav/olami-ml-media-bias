Villanova Head Coach Jay Wright sat between a dejected Kris Jenkins and Ryan Arcidiacono in the postgame press conference at Madison Square Garden last Saturday night PERIOD The Wildcats had just come up one shot short of their second straight Big East Tournament title PERIOD Meanwhile Seton Hall was still on the floor celebrating its third tournament championship in program history after taking down Villanova at The Garden for the second time in three seasons PERIOD

The trio was fielding questions about Seton Halls Isaiah Whitehead game plan adjustments and NCAA Tournament seeding PERIOD As always Wright handled the press conference with class and gave thoughtful and honest responses despite dealing with the disappointment of a heartbreaking loss PERIOD

There were few things that could have put a genuine smile on Wrights face that night but a quick question about Big East tradition and Madison Square Garden brought a refreshing tone of enthusiasm to the coachs voice PERIOD

If youre a basketball person theres no conference that matches it anywhere Wright said as his entire body seemed to perk up and leaned forward to continue his thought PERIOD Everything we do is basketball. villanovas  run in the Big East Tournament featured three consecutive games against traditional Big East opponents PERIOD

It began by revisiting the conferences premiere postrealignment rivalry in a quarterfinal matchup with Georgetown PERIOD These two teams have a tremendous history in the regular season and NCAA Tournament but it was just the fifth time they have matched up in the Big East Tournament PERIOD

After pulling away from the Hoyas in the second half the Wildcats played a pair of tight games against two other original members of the Big East Providence and Seton Hall PERIOD

Villanova has now faced Providence in the Big East Tournament nine times more than they have faced any other current team in the league PERIOD This was the second consecutive season that the two teams battled in the semifinals with the Cats fighting to a close victory in both cases PERIOD

Villanovas quarter and semifinal games highlighted the competitive history of some of the Big East most traditional programs PERIOD But neither of those games showcased the glory of playing in the Worlds Most Famous Arena as much as the Cats thrilling contest against Seton Hall in the final PERIOD

When Villanova and six other Catholic universities were given the task of using basketball to maintain the survival of the Big East in  they made it a priority to keep their postseason tournament at Madison Square Garden PERIOD The atmosphere at Saturday nights championship game reminded everyone why it was absolutely necessary to keep the tournament in that building PERIOD

Theres nowhere you would rather coach or playyour conference tournament than in Madison Square Garden Wright said PERIOD

It seems like The Garden brings out the best in players and coaches especially during the Big East Tournament PERIOD And when you are representing a traditional Big East school the lights seem to shine just a little bit brighter PERIOD

Whitehead Seton Halls sophomore guard and Most Outstanding Player of the tournament is the perfect example PERIOD His  points on  shooting fueled the Pirates and as the crowd got louder he got better PERIOD

Whitehead was the best player in the tournament last weekend but he was not the only player to benefit from the classic Big East environment at the Garden PERIOD Villanova junior forward Kris Jenkins an AllTournament performer in his own right matched Whiteheads fire and keyed his teams second half comeback PERIOD

Jenkins who finished with  points made five of  3pointers in the game with four of them coming in the second half PERIOD Late in the game he used a screen to dribble left and nail one of his longrange shots in front of two defenders one of which draped all over him PERIOD Then with  seconds left Jenkins used his body to create space and connect on a goahead 3point bomb that caused an eruption from the Garden crowd PERIOD

It may be tempting to criticize Jenkins miss with  seconds left that would have put Villanova back in front but Nova would not have even been in that position if it werent for the play of Big Smooth down the stretch PERIOD

The VillanovaSeton Hall final was the best championship game of the new Big East era PERIOD It had everything that the conference was built on for three and a half decades  physicality passion and triumph PERIOD

And those characteristics were not just confined to the players on the court PERIOD They poured over the edges of the floor and made their way into the crowd creating an unforgettable night at Madison Square Garden PERIOD
