Alyssa DErricos only service error was enough for Penn State assistant coach Dennis Hohenshelt to pull her aside and settle the fiery sophomore down PERIOD

 DErrico said Saturday PERIOD 

Three straight blocks by Christa Harmotto humbled the Michigan State attack injecting an excitement in DErrico as she raced back to the endline to serve again PERIOD She said as soon she hit the next serve it was out PERIOD

In the first set of Saturdays match the Nittany Lions gave six of Michigan States  points on service errors alone  the Spartans took just three points in the set PERIOD Nine total service errors tarnished the Lions seemingly wholesome performance PERIOD

 head coach Russ Rose said Saturday PERIOD 

The Lions cut down their service errors to just three after the first set PERIOD And Rose said his squad is siding out over  percent of the time squandering any type of run by the other team PERIOD

Rose said he would like them to serve more conservatively sometimes just for the sake of keeping it in bounds PERIOD Every weekend the service game seems to be the glaring weakness in their performance PERIOD But Rose sees luck going in his teams favor sooner or later with the amount of time spent in practice serving PERIOD

Every practice has a time slot devoted to serving Harmotto said  giving her no excuse for missing a serve especially because she serves a simple float PERIOD

 Harmotto said PERIOD 

DErrico said its not necessary for them to change their approach PERIOD Nicole Fawcett said repetition breeds confidence  even if it means going against the coachs wishes PERIOD Sometimes Rose will signal to Fawcett to deviate from her normal jump serve and serve standing PERIOD

 Rose said PERIOD 

Ask DErrico what would happen if shes inconsistent with her jump serve and she wont even consider staying flatfooted PERIOD She has less confidence in her float than her jump serve saying if her serve is off shell turn the power down a notch PERIOD

DErrico said success practicing one of the few individual skills in volleyball doesnt necessarily translate when the referee blows his whistle giving the OK to serve in a match PERIOD

She doesnt blame it on the jittery feelings a match can give a player or on the electric environment in Rec Hall PERIOD

Instead DErrico says theres a fine line between serving aggressive and just keeping it in which sometimes gets crossed when getting caught up in the emotion of the game PERIOD She said Rose looks for the proper balance of serving aggressively and under control PERIOD
