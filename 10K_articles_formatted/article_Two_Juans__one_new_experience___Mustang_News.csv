Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

Electrical engineering senior Juan Galindo is an international transfer student from El Salvador PERIOD Electrical engineering senior Juan Avelar is an international transfer student from Colombia PERIOD

Each Juan is  each Juan left their respective Central American country on a student visa and each Juan transferred to Cal Poly from a community college in Northern California PERIOD

As much as they have in common Galindo and Avelar would likely never have become friends had they remained in their home countries PERIOD Diversity within the U.S PERIOD is one major draw for international students when deciding to study abroad PERIOD

Its America you go outside and there are restaurants from all over the world Avelar said PERIOD Even in this area there are people from all different cultures. america has long been referred to as a melting pot of diverse peoples with diverse backgrounds and cultures PERIOD Cal Polyhas been previously criticized for lack of diversity but efforts are being made to attract more international students PERIOD

Galindo and Avelar moved to California after high school with relatives and received their general education at local community colleges PERIOD Both were told about Cal Poly by their professors citing an elite engineering program with relatively low tuition PERIOD

International students must jump through several procedural hoops in order to study in America but Cal Poly offers a wealth of information and support to make the process as smooth as possible PERIOD Even so prospective students must meet with their home country liaison to obtain a student visa contingent on ties back to the country to ensure their return after graduating PERIOD

Another requirement of international students is that they demonstrate proficient English skills PERIOD

One thing Avelar has been surprised by in the classroom is the extra effort required of international students to interpret their teachers dialogue then digest the information PERIOD He realized this after taking a class last summer in his home country where he did not have to worry about misinterpreting something the teacher said PERIOD

There are still words I dont fully understand he said PERIOD

Unlike Galindo and Avelar who are fulltime students on track to receive their degree from Cal Poly landscape architecture senior Nisha Gandhi came to the university from England for a set time  three quarters  via the student exchange program PERIOD Gandhi pays tuition to her school in Leeds England while a Cal Poly student essentially swaps places with her and pays Cal Poly tuition PERIOD

Gandhi lives oncampus with American roommates who she said have been very helpful in accommodating her unfamiliarity with campus life PERIOD Gandhi said she enjoys all of her architecture classes but the experience goes far beyond education PERIOD

Being here you take your one perspective and make it so much wider she said PERIOD You get so inspired by how different people think in different countries. the International Students department is currently developing a new international program with brochures and electronic information to attract international students who have never heard of Cal Poly PERIOD Such efforts will be helpful but the most important method is still word of mouth according to Interim Director of International Education Raymond Zeuschner PERIOD

Weve got the beautiful Central Coast weve got great programs and weve got great faculty he said PERIOD That all appeals to an international student. cal Poly constantly seeks international students from diverse regions of the world especially after financial support was capped at  instate students by the State of California PERIOD The remaining  students are made up of outofstate and international students who do not take the place of California students PERIOD

The classroom presents its own challenges to international students many of whom are not as accustomed to independent coursework PERIOD

We go downtown and we always see a person whos left behind because hes drunk and his friends left him Galindo said PERIOD Everyone is looking out for themselves especially in the classroom. associate director of International Students and Scholars Judy Mitchell said international students can get more than just a textbook education while attending Cal Poly PERIOD

They get to learn what were really like not just what you see in the media Mitchellsaid PERIOD

 Comments

Interesting piece HOWEVER last time I checked my country is NOT in Central America PERIOD We are South Americans PERIOD Truthfully some people get very upset over Americans USA inability to understand our location PERIOD I for one think that we are all part of the Amricas PERIOD Nonetheless you should definitely make that change to this article

Im glad to see that recently there has been a lot of talk about increasing diversity on campus especially through encouraging students from overseas to come to Cal Poly PERIOD This article shows that international students are finally somewhat in the radar PERIOD However it is disappointing that before publishing this article the newspaper does not make a little effort to get the facts right Colombia is in South America and the names of the students and their nationalities have been swapped maybe in the whole Juan anaphora they ended up losing their identities PERIOD
