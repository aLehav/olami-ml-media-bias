While Mr PERIOD Dvorins dedication to stopping what he personally believes to be murder in Blood on their Tiny Hands  is admirable he is unfortunately falling prey to the same political manipulation for which he so adamantly condemns the prochoice contingency PERIOD Luckily for him it is not he who perhaps like Roe has become a pawn in the ongoing chess game for power PERIOD Unfortunately for myself and all American women we whose rights as citizens and humans are at stake cannot so easily make appealingly glib and sweeping generalizations about our choices and bodies PERIOD No woman faced with the gutwrenching realization that she must make a terrible choice about her body and future can simply brush it off as a temporary inconvenience. it is an incredibly difficult and complicated decision and as it does indeed carry many physical emotional and spiritual repercussions for many women it is the wrong choice PERIOD It clearly was so in the case of Roe PERIOD However it is and must remain just that a choice PERIOD

I wonder if Mr PERIOD Dvorin realized how apt his comparison to the Dred Scott decision truly was for its lesson must now ring out stronger than ever across the vast valley of decades as a reminder that once a humans control over his physical person is restricted he is no longer a citizen no longer an equal entity but a slave PERIOD

Once an entire race was oppressed in order to further the political agenda of the wealthy and powerful let us not now contribute to this bloody stain on the moral fabric of our society by repeating that mistake with an entire gender PERIOD
