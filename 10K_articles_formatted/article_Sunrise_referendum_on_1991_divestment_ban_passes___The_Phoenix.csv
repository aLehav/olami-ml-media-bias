8920,2023-03-30,"on April  a Student Government Organization referendum introduced by climate activism student group Swarthmore Sunrise passed with  approval PERIOD The referendum calls for the Board of Managers to remove a clause from its investment guidelines requiring that the Investment Committee manage the endowment so as to yield the best longterm financial results rather than to pursue other social objectives. the board has cited this guideline which was added in  following divestment from Apartheid South Africa as a reason not to divest its fossil fuel company holdings PERIOD It remains unclear how the Board will respond to the referendum though the Board has historically not made policy changes from similar student initiatives PERIOD 
In the referendum Sunrise makes two demands for the Board PERIOD First they demand that a discussion of the repeal of the  Ban must be on the agenda for the next Board Meeting set for May eleventh and twelfth. second Sunrise demands that the Ban must be replaced with a holistic investment policy that takes into account both longterm financial results and Swarthmores commitment to social responsibility. sunrise previously known as Mountain Justice also ran an SGO referendum in February  calling for partial divestment PERIOD That referendum passed with . approval though President Valerie Smith and thenBoard chair Tom Spock  swiftly released a statement affirming its  decision not to divest PERIOD
Compared to last years partial divestment referendum the turnout for this referendum was slightly lower PERIOD . of the student body voted on this most recent referendum compared to . for the  referendum PERIOD
Of those who did vote  approved of the referendum while . voted against it PERIOD . students indicated no preference. in May  following a 32day sitin in Parrish led by Mountain Justice thenBoard president Gil Kemp  released a letter reporting that the Board had decided against divestment PERIOD In the letter he made an explicit reference to the  investment guidelines as a reason why Board members chose not to divest PERIOD The Board reaffirmed this decision in  following the partial divestment referendum PERIOD 
What the school has told Sunrise for the past few years has been oh we cant divest because we have this policy in place Sunrise member Aru ShineyAjay  said PERIOD Our decision was if thats the reason were given these are the terms were going to talk about. sunrise leaders ShineyAjay Gabriel Brossy de Dios  and September Porras Payea  met with President Smith and her assistant on April  prior to publicly introducing the referendum PERIOD In this meeting Smith promised that if the referendum passed she would bring it up at the May Board meeting PERIOD
We have been in contact with her since and have confirmed that she will personally present it to the Board though perhaps not necessarily express her opinion on it Porras Payea  wrote in an email to The Phoenix PERIOD Ultimately the president of the college is hired by the Board so her influence is limited but this is a big step in comparison to past conversations and referendums sic shes been involved with. however it is unclear whether the Board will carry through with the terms of the referendum even if President Smith presents the referendum at the next meeting PERIOD The Board has a mixed track record of responding to student referenda the most recent instance it carried through with the terms of a student referendum was in  when  of students voted to fly the American flag above Parrish an action that many Board members already supported PERIOD
I think its really difficult to say the exact impact of the ban on whether the Board divests ShineyAjay said PERIOD
Vice President for Finance and Administration Greg Brown has also come out in opposition to repealing the  ban PERIOD In an oped published in The Phoenix Brown asserted that he as well as members of the Board believes that lifting the ban would be a meaningless gesture PERIOD 
The Colleges investment policy takes into account broader concerns such as climate change or changes in an investment managers stated strategy when they might materially affect the financial performance of the endowment upon which we rely to support our core mission and goals PERIOD Changing the investment policy to make a moral statement with no tangible effect could have the effect of diminishing performance and reducing funding available for critical missioncentric initiatives such as financial aid and academic programs which is why the Board believes our current policy is the right one for the College Brown wrote PERIOD 
However Brossy de Dios believes that even if the Board doesnt repeal the ban having the referendum in place will give student activists more leverage to push for fossil fuel divestment PERIOD
I worked on the campaign with Mountain Justice and was here for the referendum on partial divestment last year Brossy de Dios said PERIOD One of the things around that was that having that referendum even though they had rejected it rightoff it still laid the groundwork and put a lot of pressure on them. the guideline was established in  not long after the college had fully divested itself from Apartheid South Africa PERIOD In the November   issue of The Phoenix former College president Alfred Bloom who assumed his position in  around the time the ban was instated defended the ban as a means to protect Swarthmores educational quality PERIOD
Given the primary responsibility to use our endowment to support our educational mission there would likely be very few times when we would want to take risks with the financing of that educational purpose by using the endowments to make social statements PERIOD However joining the initiative to undercut apartheid in my opinion was one such rare moment Bloom wrote PERIOD
The endowment did lose value following South African divestment which resulted in temporary pay cuts for staff and a possible decrease in financial aid PERIOD However the actual loss of returns on the endowment as compared to peer institutions that did not divest was  which was considerably less than the  million the board allocated to cover endowment losses PERIOD 
Whether the  ban was an ethical decision was the center point of debate that SGO moderated on Monday night between representatives from Sunrise and representatives from the Swarthmore Conservative Society who argued against the referendum PERIOD Students and faculty members packed into Science Center  on Monday night to watch the debate PERIOD SGO CoPresident David Pipkin  estimates that about  people attended PERIOD SGO also livestreamed the debate on its Facebook page which was viewed by  people PERIOD
Starting with their opening statements the debaters dove into conversations about whether the  ban was ethical PERIOD Porras who debated on behalf of Sunrise argued that the ban reflects poorly on the Boards commitment to social justice PERIOD
The institution of this ban raises a really pressing question does the Board of Managers regret divesting from South African apartheid Porras said PERIOD The Board of Manager believes that investments should be solely managed for financial reasons PERIOD If they truly believe that then they dont believe that divesting from apartheid is the right decision PERIOD If they do believe that divesting is the right decision there is no logical reason for this ban to be in place  It very much does not align with our values. swarthmore Conservative Society member Matt Stein  argued that the ban is essential because it prevents the school from taking a stance on issues where the student body has heterogeneous views PERIOD He made reference to the Overton window a term describing the range of ideas considered acceptable within public discourse for politicians PERIOD
The school by divesting from fossil fuels or any other thing that has views that can be defended within the Overton Window is essentially saying that those views are antithetical to the universitys values and that students should not be advocating for those views Stein said PERIOD Thats completely the opposite of what the university is supposed to be PERIOD Its supposed to be a free marketplace of ideas. stein went on to adopt a similar line of reasoning as did Bloom and Dean Brown and argued that the Ban is a safeguard against divestment for anything but the most extreme cases PERIOD
There are clearly stances such as South African apartheid where views defending are clearly not within the Overton Window and we should divest but that doesnt necessarily mean that all divestment should be on the table Stein said PERIOD
Sunrise members pushed back against Swarthmore Conservatives argument that divestment ought only to be used in extreme cases PERIOD
 You mentioned that the Overton Window applies to things that are outside of intellectual discussion things that deal with overt racism and cited South African apartheid as dealing with that Porras said PERIOD Well climate is racist PERIOD The climate crisis is specifically targeting people of color and lowincome communities that are politically socially and culturally disenfranchised. another concern that the Swarthmore Conservative Society debaters raised was that lifting the ban would make the Board susceptible to future divestment movements PERIOD Though the colleges Board of Managers has not faced serious pressure in recent years on issues other than fossil fuel investments some Board members have expressed concern that fossil fuel divestment might lead to a slippery slope toward divestment from private prisons and from companies that support Israeli occupation PERIOD
The fact is that we open a big door by taking away this ban PERIOD We open a door to divesting from a bunch of different of things PERIOD Its basically the slippery slope argument Stein said PERIOD
However Porras feels that it is antithetical to the colleges values to have a ban on all divestment PERIOD She feels that students should have space to have discussions with the board PERIOD 
Im looking at this policy and its something specifically that goes against Swarthmores values Porras said PERIOD I also think that if there are things on this campus that students feel like looking at they realize they dont want to be invested in and its financially viable to divest from thats something students should have the pathway and be able to have that discourse with the Board without this blanket ban that none of our peer institutions hold. the debaters also sparred over whether fossil fuel divestment specifically would affect the endowment returns PERIOD
Possible financial returns on the endowment are a social good in itself in order to make sure that lowincome students have greatest opportunities to come here and to make sure that students get the highest quality education possible here so they can continue on to do good things Conservative Society President Jorge Tello  said PERIOD 
ShineyAjay argued that the partial divestment proposal they introduced with the  referendum would absorb most of the potential costs of divestment PERIOD The proposal calls for the college to divest from its fossil fuel holdings in separately managed accounts or funds that solely respond to the college PERIOD For funds managed by other organizations Sunrise would have Board request that investment managers move its holdings to fossilfree accounts which would eliminate the costs of hiring another manager PERIOD She also argued that fossilfree funds are a better longterm investment given current market trends PERIOD
Theres no reason to think that divesting from fossil fuels would significantly lower our endowment ShineyAjay said PERIOD Even if it were one the endowment has really high returns and two there are choices other than financial aid the school could choose to cut back on PERIOD Sunrise Swarthmore has said repeatedly that we wont be supporting any plan for divestment that cuts back on financial aid. susanna McGrew  who attended the debate did not know how she felt about the referendum and the ban PERIOD As of Monday night McGrew had not decided whether to vote in favor or against the referendum or whether to vote at all PERIOD
The ban I think is kind of immaterial because the ban just prevents us from making these decisions its just a stopgag in a way McGrew said PERIOD I think that its probably an okay stopgag to have because most of the time I think we dont want to divest but does the ban prevent us from considering exceptional cases Maybe it does PERIOD Theres no language about that in the ban PERIOD Should it be amended to make way for exceptional cases Probably not because I think that could get into the whole slippery slope argument. reuben Gelley Newman  felt more confident about his vote on the referendum PERIOD
Im voting yes because I think Swarthmore has to back up its professed social justice values with real action on an institutional level Gelley Newman wrote to The Phoenix PERIOD The Boards investments should obviously make financial sense but must be true to the values held by students faculty and the institution as a whole. if President Smith keeps her word the referendum will go before the Board in May whose response will determine whether or not social considerations should be taken into account for the colleges future financial decisions PERIOD

Katie  is from McLean VA majoring in economics and minoring in political science PERIOD In the little time she isnt studying going to class or working on The Phoenix you can find her listening to podcasts or rereading the same ten or so books for the millionth billionth time PERIOD She doesnt know what she wants to do after college and she wishes that people would stop asking her about it PERIOD
