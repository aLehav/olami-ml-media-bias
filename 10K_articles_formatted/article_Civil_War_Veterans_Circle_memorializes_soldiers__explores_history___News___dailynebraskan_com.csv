A connection to a family member in the Civil War has inspired a Lincoln man to share his passion with others PERIOD

Ron Rockenbach who works with the Nebraska Humanities Council came up with the idea to host the Civil War Veterans Circle a memorial event for war veterans and the public a few years ago after he became a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War a nonprofit organization for descendants of Union veterans PERIOD The event took place on Saturday at Wyuka Cemetery on thirty-fifth and O streets in Lincoln PERIOD It is designed as a pregame football pep rally and a way to reflect on and honor Civil War veterans many of whom are buried at the cemetery PERIOD

Marc Witkowski a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Omaha has taken part in many similar ceremonies around the country PERIOD He said they intend to schedule an event for each home football game for the rest of the football season PERIOD

It was an experiment Witkowski said PERIOD Wed like to do it for every game. the event which Rockenbach described as half living history and half memorial is the first of its kind held at Wyuka Cemetery according to Rockenbach PERIOD

Its just so impressive to see all of the different headstones and the story on each one of them Rockenbach said PERIOD

He said that those buried in Wyuka from the Civil War include musicians special engineering regiments and those who worked with artillery PERIOD

It can be a part of a healing process for those who are veterans those who have lost people in wars and those who have people fighting right now he said PERIOD

Rockenbach said the event will focus on honoring those who fought in the Civil War  but with a twist PERIOD Rockenbach has coordinated a group of reenactors to wear Civil War period clothing and interact with visitors PERIOD

He also said that he would like to be there the rest of the season unless the ground is too frozen to be able to set up a tent for the event PERIOD

Rockenbach was first bitten by the war history bug when he was in the fifth grade PERIOD He said that many of the other boys in his class were interested in sports books and had taken them PERIOD

All of the good books were gone so the librarian gave me a book on the Civil War he said PERIOD

Rockenbach later attended an event that had Civil War reenactors which he said fascinated him PERIOD

The event wasnt easy to plan and put together according to Rockenbach PERIOD

Not many people want to jump on board he said PERIOD

He also said that it is not easy to find Civil War reenactors who will work for free PERIOD

However he said that he felt strongly about starting the event this past weekend because of the many visitors coming from Illinois for the Homecoming game PERIOD Members of the Grand Army of the Republic are buried in Wyuka and of those members  are from Illinois according to Rockenbach PERIOD

The event will also offer food similar to food served during the Civil War PERIOD Rockenbach said there will be apple cider corn bread and whatever else the weather will allow PERIOD

He said that the true reason for putting on the event is the feeling of patriotism he gets PERIOD

We wouldnt be doing this if we didnt love it he said PERIOD

Even though Rockenbach has not served in a war himself he said that he continues to be inspired by his own reallife hero  his wife PERIOD

My wife served in the army for three years and she continues to be the real soldier of our family he said PERIOD
