Korra and Asami The Legend of Korra

By Alexa Teodoro The Daily

Earth fire air water PERIOD Only the Avatar can master all four elements in The Legend of Korra a cartoon set in a world where many people have the supernatural ability to bend the elements through a combination of spirituality and martial arts mastery PERIOD

You can imagine how epic the fight scenes are PERIOD

Over the course of the series the eponymous Avatar Korra travels the world to study the bending arts with her friends by her side throughout PERIOD Among these is Asami a fierce nonbender with whom Korra initially has a tense relationship  at one point theyre vying for the same guys attention  but grows to love and trust more deeply than any of her other friends PERIOD

As viewers watched the two develop an increasingly tight bond the fandom was abuzz with Korrasami shippers PERIOD So when the two young women walk hand in hand off into the sunset which is actually a portal into the spirit world in the series finale an Internet explosion of excitement ensued PERIOD Is Korrasami canon fans wondered PERIOD

Yes it is as confirmed by the shows creators on their personal blogs PERIOD The Legend of Korra has always pushed media boundaries to begin with but to feature a prominent samesex couple on a show distributed by Nickelodeon is no small feat PERIOD

All of the shows greatness aside my favorite thing about Korra and Asamis romance is that its based on a foundation of friendship PERIOD Baes will come and go but your true girl friends are eternal PERIOD Fortunately for this couple they have both PERIOD Korrasami forever PERIOD

Kat Stratford and Patrick Verona  Things I Hate About You

By Indigo TriggHauger The Daily

Teen movies are truly a genre unlike any other PERIOD One of the crowning jewels is  Things I Hate About You set in our very own Seattle PERIOD This film gave us the perfectly imperfect Kat and Patrick a match made in teenmovie heaven PERIOD

 Things I Hate About You is the only decent adaptation of Shakespeares The Taming of the Shrew I have ever seen PERIOD Here the incredibly misogynistic source material is turned into a feminist romance PERIOD

Heath Ledger breaks my heart and puts it back together every time I rewatch it PERIOD Hes a bad boy who terrifies the whole school and is trying to help Joseph GordonLevitt get the girl of his dreams Kats sister PERIOD Shes a Seattle riot girl on an antiprom SylviaPlathfueled rampage PERIOD

The climax where Kat Julia Stiles reads her poem in class is unmatched PERIOD The piece is the eponymous  Things I Hate About You and its both a rant and a declaration of love for Patrick PERIOD Those ugly tears streaming down her face only make it more believable PERIOD

Weve all been Kat  and after all who can blame her for falling for Patrick after their adorable paintball date in Gas Works Park and him commandeering the school PA system to serenade her

Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers Scott Pilgrim franchise

By Maria Giakoumatos The Daily

Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers first found love in the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series by Bryan Lee OMalley released between  and  PERIOD Their comedic and actionpacked relationship left fans eager for the  film Scott Pilgrim vs PERIOD the World and a video game of the same name PERIOD

Before Scott Michael Cera can officially become Ramonas Mary Elizabeth Winstead boyfriend he must defeat her seven evil exes in battle PERIOD All of Ramonas exes are freakishly strong or have superpowers creating a challenge for Scott PERIOD A challenge most potential boyfriends fail PERIOD Scott however doesnt back down PERIOD Why Because he truly loves Ramona PERIOD Scott not only wants to defeat Ramonas exes to become her boyfriend but also to free Ramona from her past relationships PERIOD

While superpowered exes are as entertaining as they are unrealistic the struggles they represent for the young lovers are very relatable PERIOD Both Scott and Ramona have exes who threaten their relationship as many people do in real life and face several reallife challenges from loyalty to finances PERIOD However they work through their problems together rather than giving up creating a believable couple for fans to root for PERIOD

Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt Parks and Recreation

By Makayla Kinsella The Daily

I love you and I like you. these are the words Leslie and Ben exchange as wedding vows only after Leslie forgets her 70page draft at home PERIOD

The two use the phrase often to express their feelings and remind us of something they have that few other fictional couples do  the ultimate friendship PERIOD The pair bond over helping one another achieve their dreams and life goals while at the same time helping each other cope with disappointment and loss PERIOD

And Leslie and Bens relationship cannot be defined by one single scene or moment PERIOD Their wedding is a moment that shows their love but Ben running Leslies political campaign shows their mutual respect and support for each others careers PERIOD

The two can be described as nothing less than soul mates PERIOD

Jesse Wallace and Cline Before Sunrise and sequels

By Jakob Ross The Daily

Before Richard Linklater famously analyzed life through the lens of a child in his  film Boyhood he did pretty much the same thing with his Before trilogy PERIOD

In  audiences got their first look at charming handsome American tourist Jesse Wallace Ethan Hawke and intelligent beautiful French college student Cline Julie Delpy PERIOD The two meet on a transnational European train headed to Vienna PERIOD They hit it off almost immediately trading philosophical ideas of romance and love PERIOD Unfortunately they have to go their separate ways the next morning PERIOD

Jesse and Clines relationship is Linklaters vision of the antiHollywood couple PERIOD Their relationship has its ups and downs and spoiler alert they dont even make their love official until the  sequel Before Sunset  though they do consummate in the previous film PERIOD This trilogy which concluded in  with Before Midnight is minimalistic in plot but rich with emotional heartfelt content PERIOD Jesse and Cline have their pointless random arguments that every couple has and it feels comforting to see genuine inward imperfection in an outwardly fairytaleperfect couple PERIOD

Joe NY152 Fox and Kathleen Shopgirl Kelly Youve Got Mail

By Joe Veyera The Daily

Theres no shortage of onscreen couples whose every interaction can make your heart melt PERIOD However theres only one pairing with a connection so strong that their bond overshadows the fact that youve just watched a twohour pseudocommercial for America Online PERIOD

The premise of Youve Got Mail is simple enough and arguably more applicable now than it was in  What happens when you hit it off with someone hidden behind a screen name

And what do you do when you realize the person youve fallen for is none other than the person youre running out of business

Its not until the final  seconds that NY152 and Shopgirl meet but the coupling of Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly is in the works long before PERIOD While the two start at odds as the owners of competing book stores  Fox of the behemoth Barnes  Nobleesque Fox Books and Kelly of the quaint Shop Around the Corner  and completely unaware of each others online personas their quick wits and personalities are magnetic as they eventually overcome the cruel realities of capitalism a pairing primed by line after line of instant messaging PERIOD

It was a match made in dialup heaven PERIOD

Nick and Amy Dunne Gone Girl

By Haylee Millikan The Daily

Lets be honest Nick and Amy Dunne are perfect for each other PERIOD Less so in the movie because the portrayal of Nick was more harmless than the book but nonetheless theyve got chemistry PERIOD

The book asks us questions all longterm couples ask themselves What does marriage do to us Are relationships simply games And maybe they are PERIOD Especially in todays world where social media has allowed us to craft our lives to shift perception so that no one can see into the dark and musty corners this proves true PERIOD

Nick and Amy Dunne are the ultimate team PERIOD Theyve crafted themselves for each other crafted this life that is so close to perfect that its bound to break somehow PERIOD And when it does it really does PERIOD

So why do they stay together after all the drama Why do they still end up together Contrary to how the movie portrays it the choice is Nicks PERIOD He wants Amy on some level PERIOD To everyone else they can still be that perfect couple PERIOD They can have a perfect life PERIOD Marriage after all is about accepting your partners flaws PERIOD

Nick and Amy Dunne have the opposite of a healthy relationship PERIOD Its unhealthy to the core PERIOD But they both feed on it and it gives them what they need attention perfection fire PERIOD Some people just like the feeling of being burned PERIOD

Commander Shepard and Garrus Vakarian Mass Effect series

By Dylan Teague McDonald The Daily

The Mass Effect series of science fiction games is famed for the wealth of story choices it offers players but fans know the most important choice is this Who do you try to romance With no limit to its colorful characters wooing a love interest is one of the series richest sources of dialogue and storytelling PERIOD

Players get to create their own character Commander Shepard and those with the wisdom to play as a female Shepard can romance several specific characters PERIOD The best of these is Garrus Vakarian the lovable alien copturnedvigilante PERIOD

Being of two different species Shepard and Garrus shows of physical affection are mostly limited to kissing foreheads PERIOD Bittersweet as this is their emotions are best conveyed through words PERIOD

The romance between Shepard and Garrus is forged in the face of eldritch horrors who threaten to harvest all sentient life in the galaxy PERIOD Staring down a situation that would rend lesser minds in twain Shepard and Garrus toss around witty flirtatious banter that always feels genuine and can be disarmingly tender at unexpected moments PERIOD

At the series end minutes away from certain death Shepard and Garrus make plans to grab drinks in the afterlife PERIOD Maybe its not for everyone but thats one ideal relationship Two people who together have taken everything the galaxy can throw and refuse to be torn apart by anything PERIOD

Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf Gossip Girl

By Elizabeth Alvarado The Daily

Im not Chuck Bass without you. the moment those six words left Chucks lips my inner teenage fan girl nearly had a heart attack PERIOD The entirety of Gossip Girls first two seasons were building up to this moment  the moment it was clear that Chuck Bass Ed Westwick truly loved his Queen B Blair Waldorf Leighton Meester PERIOD

The transformation in Chucks persona as a result of his affection for Blair is incredible to say the least PERIOD In the beginning of the series Chuck is the quintessential bad boy with his I dont care about anything attitude womanizing ways and signature smirk PERIOD To see his character suddenly enamored and putting someone elses needs before his own was immensely satisfying as a viewer PERIOD

While it took forever for them to end up together  the entire six seasons of the show  it was definitely worth the wait PERIOD Seeing them finally marry each other in the midst of being chased by police officers was the icing on the cake to their rocky sixyear romance PERIOD These two were always meant to be the king and queen of the Upper East Side PERIOD Their story is dramatic overthetop and yet completely heartfelt and awwworthy PERIOD And I wouldnt have it any other way PERIOD

Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly The Office

By Emma Sailer The Daily

Theres nothing quite like watching two people fall in love PERIOD Thats exactly what The Office gave us through its nine seasons as the love between Jim Halpert John Krasinski and Pam Beesly Jenna Fischer blossomed PERIOD

A receptionist and a paper salesman at the same company appear to be a likely couple but timing was not on their sides PERIOD The two begin as best friends pranking their coworker Dwight and navigating working under Michael Scott though its clear that the they are meant to be PERIOD When all the pieces fall into place they begin a speedy courtship that culminates in a perfectly disastrous marriage and a couple of chubby toddlers PERIOD Watching Jim and Pam finally get together will leave your cheeks sore and your heart full long past Valentines Day PERIOD

If you dont believe me that Jim and Pam are the greatest fictional couple please read this quote by Jim shed a single tear and proceed to binge watch the entire series on Netflix PERIOD You will not regret it PERIOD

Toru Watanabe and Midori Kobayashi Norwegian Wood

By Jeevika Verma The Daily

Japanese author Haruki Murakami is uniquely known for his matteroffact characters PERIOD In Norwegian Wood Toru Watanabe and Midori Kobayashis are both so selfaware and their interactions vibrate with such a simple rawness that you wonder why everyone doesnt interact the way they do PERIOD

Watanabes relationship with Midori is painted with the shades of scandal form the very beginning PERIOD His emotionally gripping dynamic with Naoko his dead best friends girlfriend is already fragile enough as a result of her fight with serious depression without the added pressures of him spending all his time with another girl PERIOD

But Watanabe and Midori are pure and so is their relationship PERIOD They are honest with each other PERIOD They talk without guilt about death porn and revolution PERIOD They dont apologize for being who they are and they dont try to impress each other PERIOD They give each other space PERIOD If theyre angry they say it PERIOD If they miss each other they say it PERIOD They continually celebrate the vibrancy of their relationship and they hold on to each other reminding each other to breathe under any strain PERIOD

Watanabe does not necessarily end up with either Naoko or Midori at the end  Murakami does not write fairy tales PERIOD But I was allowed to talk about one couple so I picked Watanabe and Midori because out of the two their love is literally the one thats more alive PERIOD And it brings you to life with it PERIOD

Annie Hall and Alvy Singer Annie Hall

By Imana Gunawan The Daily

If you think Zooey Deschanel and Joseph GordonLevitts romance in  Days of Summer is adorably quirky and wistful sit down and make way for the original quirky couple Annie Hall and Alvy Singer played by Diane Keaton and Woody Allen in Allens movie Annie Hall. the movie follows Alvy a neurotic comedian with two failed marriages as he explores the demise of his relationship with Annie PERIOD They make fun of each other as they make a meal boiling lobster together a classic scene tease each other about their past love lives and have witty conversations PERIOD

But things fall apart when she moves in with him PERIOD Alvy unconsciously sabotages the relationship and they later break up PERIOD Alvys subsequent relationships are filled with bad sex and neurosis but Annie eventually asks him to reconcile their relationship PERIOD The bad sex and neurosis continue so they decide to break up again PERIOD

Alvy tries to reconcile by proposing which Annie declines PERIOD She then moves to Los Angeles while Alvy stays in New York eventually staging a play of their relationship in which the ending shows Annie accepting his marriage proposal PERIOD In the wistful coda the pair catches up with each other and even though theyve moved on they are reminded of just how much they enjoyed being in each others company

This love story reminds me that relationships are crazy and absurd and people are simply imperfect neurotic and awkward PERIOD But inexplicably we keep going through them anyway PERIOD

For Gilmore Girls superfans there arent many topics as divisive as the love life of Rory Gilmore Alexis Bledel PERIOD In seven seasons we are introduced to Rorys three major love interests smalltown boy Dean Forester Jared Padalecki rebellious intellectual Jess Mariano Milo Ventimiglia and wealthy ladies man Logan Huntzberger Matt Czuchry PERIOD

I will always be on Team Jess for a very simple reason Jess loves Rory unconditionally and he continues to be a true friend even when they are not romantically involved PERIOD

The couple breaks up in the third season but the exes reconnect over dinner in the sixth season PERIOD Jess calls Rory out for dropping out of Yale University and dating Logan who he refers to as this jerk. this scene culminates in Jess saying I know you better than anyone PERIOD This isnt you. jess recognizes that Rory deserves to be treated better by Logan and he is not afraid to be honest when her choices reflect poor judgment PERIOD

Gilmore Girls fans constantly argue over Rorys refusal to accept Logans marriage proposal in the final season but I say there is no need for debate PERIOD It always should have been Jess PERIOD
