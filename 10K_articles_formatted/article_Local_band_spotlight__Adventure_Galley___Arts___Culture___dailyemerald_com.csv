7692,1970-01-01,"not a lot of bands can say That was when our van blew up or  when one is recounting their history  can claim one of their singles beat out over  bands in a national contest PERIOD But local Eugene band Adventure Galley can PERIOD

Formed in  by childhood friends David Mill and Aaron Johnsonhttpadventuregalleymusic.comsectionpress Adventure Galley combines punk rock with synthesizer keyboard and other indie characteristicsI thought this was New Wave or even glam rock characteristics to create their own postpunk indie sound which is influenced by bands such as The Clash The Cure Arcade Fire and MGMT PERIOD

Initially beginning with Mill and Johnson as vocalists the group has traded out and welcomed new members nearly every year since its formation adding Brock Grenfell on drums George Schultz on keys and guitar in  Jesse Suihkonen on bass in  and Forrest Grenfell on synthesizer in .httpadventuregalleymusic.comsectionpress

Its funny because almost everybody who joined the band besides Aaron and David has joined because they filled in for a gig Grenfell said PERIOD

Together the band recorded and put out their first EP The Right Place to Be in May  and then did a short tour on the West Coast that same spring PERIOD This is when the van troubles started PERIOD Although their van did not technically blow up Schultz confessed the engine caught on fire after two days of other difficulties leading them  after a second van had come and gone  to an RV as their current choice for tour transportation PERIOD

Later in  after the success of their EP they became the winners of Toyota Music Rock the Space  competition on MySpace capturing the regard of MySpace Records with their first single Addict and beating out thousands of other bands that entered PERIOD This attention  which they admit was completely unexpected according to Brock  allowed them to also receive funding for a fulllength album and to be featured on commercials for Oregon State University and the sports camera company GoPro.httpgopro.com

Most of the band members have done all of this while working and attending school PERIOD Split evenly between Eugene and Portland members usually commute from one city to the other on weekends in order to practice for their live shows which they play fairly consistently in both Eugene and Portland PERIOD

Live is less beauteous for sure but its much more invigorating to go out in front of people and go crazy Grenfell commented PERIOD Were pretty high energy live. schultz agreed PERIOD As weve learned you can screw up over and over and over again but if the singer is like standing up on top of your keyboard stand and screaming into the mic  people get into that because they come for a show and they want energy and they want action PERIOD So we definitely try to give them that. currently focusing on shows in Portland to see how they do in a big city the group is also awaiting the release of their first fulllength album which has just been mastered and sent to the band PERIOD

Hopefully people dance to it PERIOD I think thats the most important to me PERIOD I hope that people find it danceable Grenfell said of their newest album which they recorded in spring of  with producer Dave Trumfio Wilco Built to Spill.httpthisisthenewblack.commonstre.html He stated it has more of an electronic influence than their previous album PERIOD

Im not going to expect everybody to write a screenplay based on our songs but just knowing that it inspired somebody and that somebody was like I really love this song is a good thing Schultz said of what he hopes people will get out of Adventure Galleys music PERIOD I feel that way about a lot of music so if I can do something that other people feel that way about then thats epic. he continued It just feels right so were going to stick with it PERIOD No matter what happens PERIOD Because theres millions of bands out there and more often than not the best you make it is the dive bars downtown PERIOD But  I feel pretty optimistic about the future of Adventure Galley. adventure Galley tentatively hopes to release their upcoming LP sometime next spring and expects to return to Eugene to play shows at the beginning of the new year PERIOD
