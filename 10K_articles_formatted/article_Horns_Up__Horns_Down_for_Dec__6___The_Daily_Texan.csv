Horns Down Candidates refuse to release tax returns

Only  of the  candidates running for the major statewide offices of governor lieutenant governor attorney general comptroller land commissioner agriculture commissioner and railroad commissioner released their last three tax returns when requested to do so by the Texas Tribune PERIOD Though state officials are not required to disclose their tax returns to hold public office the financial reporting rules for candidates and lawmakers in Texas are fairly lax Cal Jillson a political science professor at Southern Methodist University referred to them as Swiss cheese reporting requirements. by disclosing tax returns candidates can give voters a clearer picture of any potential conflictsofinterest that could sway their lawmaking once voted in PERIOD While we respect the privacy of the candidates we feel comfortable prioritizing the openness of the political process in Texas PERIOD Rather than thank the candidates who turned over their returns  because ideally doing so would be a nobrainer  well stick with expressing our disappointment in the candidates who refused to comply with the Tribunes request PERIOD
