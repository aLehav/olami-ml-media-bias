UC Davis students can now have personal identity protection without breaking their budgets PERIOD

The university is partnering with security company Identity Finder LLC to give their Identity Finder software free to all UC Davis students PERIOD It will also be available through ucdavis.edu PERIOD

The CEO of Identity Finder LLC Todd Feinman stressed the importance of having such security on computers as a way to mitigate the higher risk of physical theft PERIOD

Today your personal information is not only your Social Security or credit card numbers but also your password to log into PayPal or your bank account Feinman said in an interview with educationnews.org PERIOD Once a hacker gets into your bank account and transfers money to another account it is extremely hard to get back. the software protects students against identity theft by scanning their computer files and Internet browsers for sensitive information PERIOD

Users then have several options PERIOD Shred is the option that deletes files scrub replaces the information on the file quarantine shreds the old file while copying a new one into a secure location and secure protects the file through password encryption PERIOD

Identity Finder LLC is already licensed by UC Davis and the UC Davis Health System to provide software for faculty use chosen for including fewer false positives and the capability to search additional file formats according to a UC Davis Information Education Technology Report PERIOD

False positives occur when the software confuses nonsensitive information such as vendor tracking numbers i.e PERIOD UPS FedEx with private data such as bank or credit card numbers PERIOD

In a test by smallbusinesscomputing.com Identity Finder did generate false positives when it confused nonsensitive information such as vendor tracking numbers with private data such as bank or credit numbers however it was able to ignore fake Social Security and credit card numbers that were placed next to real ones PERIOD

Security experts note that while having identity protection software does help it should not lead to an attitude of complacency PERIOD Adopting an attitude of vigilance preempts major problems in the long run PERIOD

I would say that it does provide assistance but I think that it shouldnt lull you into a false sense of security said Matt Cullina CEO of Identity Theft  PERIOD I think the more folks are looking at things on a daily basis the more theyre going to stop something from happening right away or possibly avoid it altogether. need for the software is apparent PERIOD According to a Privacy Rights Clearinghouse study security breaks at American universities compromised the personal data of  individuals in the first nine months of  alone PERIOD

Sensitive material included names academic records credit card numbers and Social Security numbers PERIOD

Cullina said the decentralized nature of universities created problems for security officials in charge of protection PERIOD He noted that the university is in charge of overseeing and protecting  computers some issued by the university and expressed the difficulty of that situation PERIOD

There may be a lot of sensitive information in each areas files and if there are simple ways to centralize that data and protect it in one place rather than trying to protect it in all these various areas that may be a better way to go Cullina said PERIOD

While larger issues are raised students are just happy they can get the complimentary software PERIOD

Its a brilliant idea said Larry Liu a sophomore neurobiology physiology and behavior major PERIOD Because youre being given this software for free you dont have an excuse not to use it. to obtain a copy of Identity Finder visit software.ucdavis.eduindex.cfm and look under software to receive further instruction PERIOD
