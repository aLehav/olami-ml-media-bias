Once again the University of Massachusetts has been spotlighted for its science and technology prowess among research institutions PERIOD Two separate teams of researchers have received grants from the National Science Foundation for furthering the progress and study of nanotechnology PERIOD

Nanotechnology involves the creation of new materials or devices with highly specialized properties or uses by controlling the assembly of building blocks as small as a billionth of a meter according to a UMass press release PERIOD

The two teams will be studying different aspects of this groundbreaking technology PERIOD One group will be looking at developing arrays of nanowires that could eventually lead to ultra fine resolutions on computer screens PERIOD The other will be studying the formation of materials with pores of molecular dimensions which are currently used in chemical processes such as catalysis and gas separation PERIOD

A year and a half ago people in the NSF and other federal agencies realized that theyre all sorts of neat things being invented with nanotechnology Mark Tuominen a physics professor and lead Principle Investigator for one of the teams said PERIOD The US should support more research to keep the US ahead in the world. joining Tuominen on his team are Thomas Russel from the Polymer Science department Jaques Penelle and Tom McCarthy of the science and engineering department and Vince Rotello from the Chemistry department PERIOD Six graduate students from different science fields who have yet to be chosen also will assist them PERIOD

These particular scientists have been working together for the last three years PERIOD They had a similar grant from the NSF that started the project PERIOD The new team grant allows us to take it to the next level Tuominen said PERIOD

Tuominens team will focus on nanofabricatonthe science of developing structures so small that they can only be seen with highmagnification electron microscopes PERIOD They hope to make nanostructures by selfassembly that form arrays of magnetic nanowires patterned together to make a stencil PERIOD Those stencils will then be used for many purposes such as the storage of computer data PERIOD

By using selfassembly were mimicking what nature does like how a cell membrane is put together Tuominen said PERIOD The way data is stored on a computer is magnetically PERIOD Well have an array of nanomagnets up to one trillion on every square inch which may allow more data on a disk. the arrays can be to create extremely concentrated storage of data such as the storing of  fulllength DVDquality movies on a disc the size of a quarter PERIOD The team hopes that with more development the technology will be ready within five to  years PERIOD

We use that same polymer stencil to grow wires to be used for field emission display property Tuominen said PERIOD The display will be thin as paper cheaper to make than todays laptops PERIOD Its only five to  years in the future PERIOD Were trying to invent ways to bring about production like this. the other research team is lead by Peter Monson and Michael Tsapatsis of the chemical engineering department and Scott Auerbach of the chemistry department PERIOD They are working in conjunction with Dionisios Vlachos and Raul Lobo from the University of Delaware PERIOD Other UMass team members include Efrosini Kokkoli and Jorn Sherman of chemical engineering and Murugappan Muthukumar of polymer science and engineering PERIOD

This group will rely on laboratory experiments and theory to study nonporous solids according to the press release PERIOD Nanoporous solids are materials with regular perfectly sized pores that serve as precise filters allowing some molecules to pass through while screening others out PERIOD The team plans to explore how tiny building blocks assemble to form crystalline solids and they can be used to form new materials with advanced properties PERIOD

This technology holds the potential for future development of extremely precise lasers sensitive sensors and smallscale optical and electronic devices PERIOD It also has possible implications in the petrochemical industry which relies on nanoporous solids for catalysis and separation PERIOD

The two grants will give approximately  to the teams PERIOD Tuominens team will receive  over five years whereas Monsons team will receive  million over four years PERIOD Many schools vied for the NSFs attention but it was the science going on at UMass that finally brought the money in PERIOD

Many other groups tried but our university got the grants Tuominen said PERIOD That says a lot about the work thats going on here at UMass Amherst. every other week the Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team NIRT meets to discuss the progress and learn about what the other departments do PERIOD According to Tuominen having team members from different science departments in the university brings experiences and perspectives to the project that help everyone learn more about it PERIOD

You basically need all these things to be integrated to be able to make it Tuominen said PERIOD It makes sense its exactly what goes on in a companybring people together to solve problems as a system PERIOD Its essential to bring people together. both projects not only bring together faculty from diverse backgrounds they also have substantial educational components PERIOD They create new graduate courses industrial internships for graduate and postdoctoral students and engaging undergraduates in the research process PERIOD

Were trying to go further to create useful things Tuominen said PERIOD Invent stuff here at UMass and then teach other about it so it can really be used PERIOD

Theres a lot of learning going on but thats what research is all about. cancel reply
