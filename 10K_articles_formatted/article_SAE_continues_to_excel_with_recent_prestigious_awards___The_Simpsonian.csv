INDIANOLA Iowa  Simpson College Iowa Sigma chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon SAE fraternity had a repeat performance of summer success at their national conference by earning the Outstanding Chapter in the Province award for the third straight year PERIOD

In addition to winning the John O PERIOD Moseley Zeal award naming them the best SAE chapter theyve proven themselves to be outstanding in individual aspects as well PERIOD

At the  national ritual institute the chapter earned the Noble Leslie DeVotie Ritual Award PERIOD

Senior Blake Brown SAE vice president said theyve sent a lot of people to the ritual institute in recent history PERIOD Members also took part in Iowa Betas recolonizing at the University of Iowa and initiated them into their colony status PERIOD

Nate Sams the current president of SAE said they hold all the ceremonies included in the ritual book including graduation ceremony and exchanging of officers PERIOD He said they like to go above and beyond the basic requirements of ritual within their fraternity PERIOD

We are a group of guys who come together and our ritual is our set of principles and ideals and our ritual helps us to follow those ideals hold each other accountable and make sure we are the best we can be Brown said PERIOD

Competing for national chapter awards motivates SAE to stay humble and improve the chapter PERIOD

Pierce Carey the newly elected president of the Iowa Sigma chapter said he knows other chapters will not stay complacent and it motivates the new executive committee to constantly better the chapter PERIOD

I was really happy that we have a young executive team with a lot of new ideas to hopefully promote our chapter and the wellbeing of it Carey said PERIOD

The awards have contributed to a culture of success and achievement that will help in recruitment as noted by sophomore Daniel Goldsmith PERIOD

As a sophomore these awards are setting a precedent for our younger members and motivates us to keep moving in this direction Goldsmith said PERIOD

Awards may not be a determining factor in potential new member decisions to join a house but it shows the values of the house and is a substantial representation of those qualities Sams said PERIOD

In the future SAE will work to have better alumni relations increased community service hours and philanthropic dollars raised PERIOD

Consistency has been an overwhelming attribute of this chapter as they have won Outstanding Chapter GPA in their province since  PERIOD In the past two years they have consecutively won the Gordon A PERIOD Timpany Award for Member Education and Outstanding Scholarship Programming PERIOD

Academics are key to this chapter even beyond the rest of their goals PERIOD

Its really important to us as men and striving to be true gentlemen Brown said PERIOD

SAE competes with larger schools with larger membership but SAE has proven membership size doesnt matter PERIOD

Winning Zeal at the national level and then outstanding chapter at the province level shows that just because we are a small fraternity of just under  guys doesnt mean that we cant do outstanding things Carey said PERIOD When we go up against chapters at big state schools it shows that Simpson is small and can have a very effective and efficient chapter on campus. multimedia Journalism Professor Lisa Carponelli is adding a new job to her weekly todo list the Saturday evening anchor at WHO  PERIOD This marks.. PERIOD
