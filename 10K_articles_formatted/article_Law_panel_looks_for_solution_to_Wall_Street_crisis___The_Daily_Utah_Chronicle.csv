As the Dow dropped below  for the first time in four years Monday the Quinney College of Law hosted a panel of experts reviewing the recent meltdown on Wall Street PERIOD

Law professor Christopher Peterson a scholar on subprime and predatory lending said as many as  million families are facing home foreclosure8212roughly three times the population of Utah PERIOD As those numbers continue to rise the country is faced with finding a solution PERIOD

Peterson said the rapid breakdown of the financial system happened largely because of dishonesty from the lenders to the borrowers PERIOD

We have become tolerant of commercial fictions and outright deception Peterson said PERIOD

As lenders sought borrowers they deceptively pushed them into mortgages that were beyond the borrowers financial means he said PERIOD

Peterson suggested the financial situation in the United States needs comprehensive changes PERIOD Among many necessary reforms the financial sector needs to require all mortgages to be suitable to the borrowers needs PERIOD

Regulation is also a key component in financial reform he said PERIOD

Its time for the country to realize we have lost the thrift mode of our ancestors Peterson said PERIOD We need a comprehensive bill that regulates the financial industry. law professor Christian Johnson an expert on markets banking and derivatives followed Peterson to help explain the governments solution to the crisis PERIOD

After attempting to halt the plummeting economy by lowering interest rates and lending to banks from the Federal Reserve Congress passed the recent  billion financial bailout PERIOD The 442page bill created a type of financial bureaucracy overseen by Congress to essentially fix Wall Street Johnson said PERIOD

The whole program is going to be run by Wall Street Johnson said PERIOD Theyre the only ones who understand how this complicated process works. the premise of this  billion solution is to curb financial losses and restore confidence in the economic world PERIOD

Although  billion is a large number it is less than  percent of the United States  trillion national debt Johnson said PERIOD

Now that the bill has been passed the question lingers of whether it will work PERIOD

I think the risks are so great of doing nothing that even though it is an enormous amount of money it pales in comparison to the economic effects if things keep deteriorating Johnson said PERIOD

Although this financial crisis is rooted in Wall Street it reaches the homes of U students he said PERIOD As the economic world continues to deteriorate students will find their financial situations becoming more and more stressful PERIOD Student loans home loans and basic credit will all be harder to obtain PERIOD

Johnson also said he fears the impact a failing economy would have on graduating students PERIOD

Were all afraid that if this continues well see business unable to expand and do the hiring they want to do Johnson said PERIOD Its very important we attack this and get the economy moving again PERIOD If we dont fix this mess its going to be more difficult for students to do the things they want to do in the long term. community members packed the Moot Court Room at the law school but not many students attended the event PERIOD
