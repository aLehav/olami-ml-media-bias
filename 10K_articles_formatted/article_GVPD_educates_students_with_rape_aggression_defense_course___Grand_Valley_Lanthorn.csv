Oftentimes theyre pretty good looking people Athletic looking PERIOD Sometimes they can be pretty charming They arent just trolls under the bridge. these words are from Grand Valley State University Sergeant Nate Dornbos during a Rape Aggression Defense R.A.D. class held on Monday Nov PERIOD  as he explained the difficulties of trying to profile sexual assault attackers PERIOD According to Dornbos there are no true physical profiles to serve as warnings and only potential behaviors to look out for PERIOD Additionally in approximately  percent of sexual assault incidents the victim knows their attacker  whether from a class party or other association PERIOD

Exclusive only to female participants the introductory R.A.D PERIOD class was a threehourlong seminar that provided knowledge on sexual assault crimes and basic selfdefense training to women PERIOD The Grand Valley Police Department said that the intent of the program was to empower women through selfawareness and discussions about basic fundamentals of prevention and selfdefense. firstyear student Marissa Morey said that she wanted to attend the seminar to learn more about the subject PERIOD

I just think its really important to have these conversations and recent events have made me want to educate myself on this subject more Morey said PERIOD

Data from the Office on Womens Health of the U.S PERIOD Department of Health and Human Services estimates that one out of every five women in college will experience some form of sexual assault PERIOD However of these cases about  percent are unreported PERIOD Dornbos attributed this to multiple factors including the victims desire to avoid negative publicity and confrontation feelings of guilt over their own behaviors such as if alcohol was involved and general distrust of the police PERIOD In addition if the attacker was an acquaintance the victim may feel hesitant to report the crime brushing the incident off as just a mistake. a  sociological report titled I Didnt Want to be That Girl The Social Risks of Labeling Telling and Reporting Sexual Assault also identified interpersonal risks of reporting as a major deterrent of why so many victims opted to not go to authorities PERIOD The social scientists from Columbia University provided one example of a college student who was sexually assaulted by a friend of her roommate and did not report what had happened because she was worried that if her roommate found out it would lead to conflict between her and the roommate. the R.A.D PERIOD seminar focused largely on types of survival strategies including verbal strategies like yelling in order to draw attention to the situation avoidance strategies such as keeping distance from suspicious activity and avoiding isolation while at parties and compliant resistance strategies such as vomiting or telling your attacker you have a sexually transmitted disease PERIOD

The R.A.D PERIOD Continuum of Survival Codes is colorbased and has three distinct levels ranging from yellow based on awareness of surroundings to orange where avoidance measures are necessary to red where defensive measures are necessary PERIOD

In addition to educating R.A.D PERIOD seminar participants on these strategies and as to where they can get help or report any incidents officers instructed them in some selfdefense skills PERIOD Participants practiced defensive stances kicks and punches PERIOD Officers also demonstrated tactics to get out of choke holds PERIOD
