For a long time now Ive been uneasy about the rebuke to mind ones own business. of course if someone asks us for some personal information and we have misgivings about what it will be used for then we might be justified in telling them that wed rather not say PERIOD The salient question raised by it is what exactly is my business

Certainly some things can be the business of many individuals PERIOD It seems that the things that comprise my business are those that affect me or might affect me or those that might affect anyone whose wellbeing would affect me PERIOD I dont think the idea of people having their own business distinct from the business of others is tenable PERIOD

It is especially difficult for people to see why one should care what another person believes in the privacy of their own minds PERIOD However once we realize that what people believe determines how they will behave we can see how ones behavior invariably affects the wellbeing of others PERIOD

I am concerned about the beliefs of others because I genuinely care about the people affected PERIOD If someone believes that something is causing them to endure any variety or intensity of suffering for no perceivable good reason then I would like to know more about why they behave that way in the hope of changing my mind or theirs PERIOD

An irreligious person might question the beliefs of a pious acquaintance or even stranger knowing that if they are right about the claims of their faith the questioner is wrong with respect to their understanding of the universe and their place in it PERIOD Too often I fear these conversations are ended because the person being questioned is too quick to take offence and too entitled to respect others beliefs PERIOD

Insofar as one feels that another is causing harm or not realizing potential wellbeing through their behavior then one is justified in questioning that person PERIOD At any rate it seems blameless for a particularly compassionate person to take interest in the lifestyle  or relationship even  of a person if it comes from a place of genuine concern for their wellbeing PERIOD If a stranger reveals themself to be toiling under the burden of their ignorance misinformation or bad ideas I see no reason why weshouldntoffer compassionate words of advice even if they didnt ask for them PERIOD

I believe minding ones business is simply a symptom of the fact that people dont like being criticized PERIOD Part of the reason that people dont like being criticized is because those doing the criticizing are usually less than kind and because we are often not able to defend our behavior as well as we might like PERIOD We are constrained by liberal notions of tolerance and political correctness towards the ideas beliefs and behaviors we find unethical or at least unreasonable and we are told not to butt in PERIOD

We should be constructive and compassionate when broaching touchy subjects and we should withhold information when we can see no good results from divulging it PERIOD

However this saying is a problem considering how much of what people do can negatively affect others and is therefore worth criticizing PERIOD It is also a problem because people neglect to inquire about things that interest or puzzle them for fear of offending PERIOD When these beliefs affect how people vote raise their children or treat others which they inevitably do then I am that much more concerned PERIOD Our beliefs affect each other PERIOD

To tell someone to mind their own business is to fail to meet their criticism with any defense PERIOD It is to shy away from a conversation that could benefit both parties PERIOD The next time you feel the urge to say it ask yourself what you are afraid of and remember never to be afraid of being wrong PERIOD
