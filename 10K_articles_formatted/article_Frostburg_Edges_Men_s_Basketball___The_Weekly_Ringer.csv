Despite trailing for most of the game last Saturday the University of Mary Washington mens basketball team took the lead with less than a minute to play when sophomore E.J PERIOD Willis drained a 3pointer to give the Eagles a  advantage PERIOD
It was the first lead for UMW since the  mark of the first half but the Eagles didnt get to savor it for long as late free throws ended up sinking head coach Rod Woods team PERIOD UMW sophomore Walt Smith missed a pair of foul shots with  seconds remaining that would have extended the Eagles lead and the Bobcats Bradley Nunn connected on two from the charity stripe with under  seconds to play to help Frostburg State edge the Capital Athletic Conferences CAC top team  PERIOD
I missed some key free throws some big free throws man Smith said PERIOD Its real frustrating PERIOD Im in the gym everyday practicing free throws PERIOD I just feel like I let my team down PERIOD I could have put us up threeand I really took that hard PERIOD I told the team thats on me. smith wasnt the only Eagle to struggle from the foul line as Mary Washington was just  for the game and they shoot just  percent from the stripe as a team on the season PERIOD
I think its more of a head problem then a repetition or a skill problem Wood said of his teams free throw shooting struggles PERIOD
The 15year coach also added that he thought his highoctane style of play wears down his team as well as their opponent and makes them susceptible to those problems at the foul line PERIOD Despite Nunns two clutch free throws to seal the win the Bobcats were just  on free throws in the game PERIOD
The loss was the first conference blemish for the Eagles   who remain a game up on St PERIOD Marys College for first place in the CAC PERIOD The victory for Frostburg State   moved them into a tie for third in the conference PERIOD Senior Henry Brisibe was Mary Washingtons top performer contributing a doubledouble with his 13point 11rebound effort in the loss PERIOD

Meanwhile for the Bobcats Troy Dockett led the way with a gamehigh  points while also adding seven rebounds to help FSU pull off the upset PERIOD
The Eagles other big struggle this past weekend was on the glass where Frostburg State outrebounded UMW  and Woods team surrendered  offensive rebounds that led to numerous second chance points for the Bobcats PERIOD
I was more perturbed with how many offensive rebounds the other team got than our foul shooting and thats a toughness issue Wood said PERIOD We cant give up second shots because if were taking the ball out of the net then we cant get our fast break out and then we cant control the tempo. while a loss never sits well Smith said that he thinks the team has been grounded by the defeat which could benefit the Eagles in the long run PERIOD
I think the loss kind of helped us because I feel like its made us more hungry Smith said PERIOD We know everybody is coming for us now PERIOD Its humbled us PERIOD We were 80but at this point records dont matter PERIOD Any team on any given night can be beat. wood emphasized that now that his team is going through the conference a second time they will need to make some adjustments if they want to keep winning games PERIOD He stressed that he needs more out of his post players in terms of scoring in the paint and creating second chance opportunities with offense rebounds PERIOD

Wood the current frontrunner for Conference Coach of the Year also said that his players need to tighten up as a unit in their half court defense as he believes teams will likely try to slow the Eagles down in the coming weeks to get them out of their game PERIOD But while Wood believes those tweaks need to be made they arent as paramount as what he said soonafter PERIOD
We need to be tougher and we need to be more physical Wood said PERIOD If were able to do that and maintain the rest of our game were as good as anybody and better than most in our conference. the Eagles will be back on the court Saturday afternoon as UMW hosts St PERIOD Marys College at  p.m PERIOD in the Anderson Center in a game that has significant conference implications PERIOD",Frostburg Edges Men's Basketball â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
