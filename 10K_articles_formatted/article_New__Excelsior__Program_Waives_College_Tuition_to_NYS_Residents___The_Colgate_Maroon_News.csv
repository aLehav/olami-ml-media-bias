Former SUNY Chancellor D PERIOD Bruce Johnstone expressed his skepticism PERIOD

If youre really concerned about students who are not attending because of the reality or the perception of unaffordability this is not the way to help them Johnstone said PERIOD

Johnstone along with other skeptics views the program as exclusive and economically irresponsible PERIOD On the other side of the spectrum many advocates of Excelsior believe that the scholarship will further the conversation regarding eligibility and affordability expansion PERIOD

While a large part of the Excelsiors function is to support middleincome students it will also establish New York as the first state in the country to make tuition free for not only fouryear public universities but also for twoyear community colleges PERIOD Now that Cuomo has set the precedent for other states and has gotten that headline according to E.J PERIOD McMahon the founder and Research Director of the Empire Center for Public Policy Cuomo and his team must now consider details and confront the possible consequences. the rationale is clear The Excelsior scholarship at its core seeks to create a culture that strives to combine education with job and business creation Cuomo said PERIOD It provides middleclass students with the opportunity to go to college for free and then guides them to use their experience to benefit the state that generously made that education possible. while the state will pay out of pocket for tuition costs the goal of instituting this scholarship is to eventually put those dollars back in the states wallet when the Excelsior graduates become business people and taxpayers PERIOD This jobdriven program however comes with some serious drawbacks by the scholarships third year of action it is projected to cost  million and despite the broadened accessibility to education it is still possible that many graduates will continue to be unemployed PERIOD The state should relish in its accomplishment while remaining wary of the scholarships economic and selective limitations PERIOD

Cuomos perspective on the Excelsior program is well summed up in his statement on the New York State website PERIOD

In New York State every child will have the opportunity that education provides. lectures
