Jacob Allgeier studies a reef in the waters of Abaco Island Bahamas in  PERIOD

Coral reefs are among the most productiveand imperiledecosystems in the world PERIOD One of the many threats they face is pollution from runoff and poorly treated wastewater which upsets the delicate balance of nutrients they require PERIOD

Recent research led by University of Georgia ecologists sheds new light on the natural nutrient dynamics of coral reefs particularly the often overlooked but critical role of fish PERIOD Their findings published in Global Change Biology could help inform future research and coral conservation efforts PERIOD

Coral reefs occur in tropical and subtropical coastal waters that are naturally low in nitrogen and phosphorus PERIOD A certain amount of these nutrients is essential for coral growth but too much can increase the likelihood of coral disease and death PERIOD Lead author Jacob Allgeier who conducted his research while at UGA and received his doctorate from the Odum School of Ecology in  has spent years studying coral reefs in the Caribbean PERIOD He suspected the fishes that gather on reefs had a role to play in regulating nutrient levels and set out to determine ifand howthey did so PERIOD

Allgeier now a postdoctoral research associate at North Carolina State University and his colleagues established study sites at healthy reefs in the Caribbean dominated by four different types of corals as well as nearby mangrove forests and sea grass beds for the sake of comparison PERIOD

First they surveyed the fish communities present at each site documenting fish numbers species and sizes at each location finding more than  individual fishes from  species PERIOD

Allgeier used field measurements and modeling techniques to estimate how much nitrogen and phosphorus fishes from  of those  species were storing in their bodies and how much they were introducing to their environment through excretion PERIOD Their estimates accounted for more than  percent of the total body mass of fishes at all sites PERIOD They incorporated these data into mathematical models to determine how much nitrogen and phosphorus entire fish communities were storing and introducing at each site PERIOD

They found first that fish did indeed provide a substantial amount of nitrogen and phosphorus at levels that were largely determined by the structure of the fish community PERIOD The fish communities that stored and supplied the most nutrients tended to have high levels of species diversity but were often dominated by just a few species especially largebodied ones PERIOD

A key finding was that although the overall amounts of nutrients supplied by the fish communities differed substantially across sites the ratio at which they occurred was typically very similarapproximately  parts nitrogen to one part phosphorusat all four coral reefs but importantly not at the mangrove or seagrass bed sites PERIOD

Our results suggest that the consistent ratio at which fishes cycle nutrients on these reefs may provide important insight as to the demands for nutrients by coral Allgeier said PERIOD

He and his colleagues reviewed the coral literature and found that previous experimental studies have shown that corals thrive when nutrients occur at almost exactly the proportions provided by fish in the study and tend to decline in health or die when nutrient proportions deviate from this range PERIOD

Allgeier said that the teams findings could eventually provide important guidance for managing nutrient inputs into coral reef ecosystems informing pollution control measures and fishing regulations for instance PERIOD

The crux of the story is that changing the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus may have negative consequences for coral reefs Allgeier said PERIOD Its important to incorporate fish nutrient dynamics into the conservation of these ecosystems PERIOD Fish are clearly playing an important role we now just need to better understand exactly what this role is. the studys coauthors were associate professor Amy Rosemond of the UGA Odum School Craig A PERIOD Layman of Florida International University and Peter J PERIOD Mumby of the University of Queensland PERIOD The research was supported by the U.S PERIOD Environmental Protection Agency the National Science Foundation the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Australian Research Council PERIOD The paper is available online at httponlinelibrary.wiley.comdoi10.1111gcb.12566full
