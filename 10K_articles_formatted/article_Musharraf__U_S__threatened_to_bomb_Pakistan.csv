WASHINGTON AP  President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan says the United States threatened to bomb his country back to the Stone Age after the  attacks if he did not help Americas war on terror PERIOD

Musharraf says the threat was delivered by Richard Armitage then the deputy secretary of state to Musharrafs intelligence director the Pakistani leader told CBSTVs  Minutes PERIOD

The intelligence director told me that Armitage said Be prepared to be bombed PERIOD Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age Musharraf said in the interview to be shown Sunday on the CBS television network PERIOD

It was insulting Musharraf said PERIOD I think it was a very rude remark he told reporter Steve Kroft PERIOD

But Musharraf said he reacted responsibly PERIOD One has to think and take actions in the interests of the nation and that is what I did he said PERIOD

According to  Minutes Armitage disputed the language attributed to him but did not deny the message was a strong one PERIOD The former deputy secretary of state could not be reached immediately by the Associated Press at his home or his office PERIOD

In a speech in January  four months after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon Musharraf gave a speech in which he clearly came down on the side of reform at home and opposition to Islamic fundamentalism PERIOD

Pakistan to this day is considered a close ally of the United States in the struggle with militant groups PERIOD Sometimes however Pakistan appears reluctant to go after Taliban which controlled neighboring Afghanistan until  and has intensified its insurgency in the southern part of the country in recent months PERIOD

He is scheduled to meet today at the White House with President Bush and then see Bush again next week in a threeway meeting with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan PERIOD
