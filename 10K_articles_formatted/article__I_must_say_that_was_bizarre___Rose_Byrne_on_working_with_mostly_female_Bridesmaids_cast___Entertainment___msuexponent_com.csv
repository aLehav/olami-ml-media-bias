Rose Byrne found it  working with mostly all women on Bridesmaids PERIOD

The 44yearold Australian actress starred as the snooty and overthetop bridesmaid Helen Harris III in the  romcom classic alongside Kristen Wiig Maya Rudolph Melissa McCarthy Wendi McLendonCovey Ellie Kemper Rebel Wilson and more PERIOD

And it was one of few productions that was femaledominated of its time PERIOD

Speaking on the SmartLess podcast she said It was weird acting with that many women I must say that was bizarre like the big days where we had all those set pieces and it was just like eight women or all of the girls together it was weird because that was really unusual because usually if youre in a film its not often youre the only woman or youre doing a scene opposite a guy or its very rare to have that PERIOD



Roses comment on working with a mostlyfemale cast in the maledominated movie business comes after she revealed she teaches her sons about equality and female empowerment PERIOD

Rose has two young sons Rocco and Rafa with partner Bobby Cannavale and has said she wants to make sure her children are aware of the importance of gender equality especially when it comes to raising a family PERIOD

She told Marie Claire Australia For a start I teach them about womens rights by being a working parent PERIOD Were an example of a household that balances both parents going out to work PERIOD But I also totally respect mothers who stay home PERIOD Its really hard work PERIOD Why is raising a family not working What goes on in the home is the most beneficial contribution to children and society. rose starred as Gloria Steinem in the  series Mrs PERIOD America and said she thought she knew about feminism before taking on the role but learned so much about the movement while playing the journalist PERIOD

Gloria became nationally recognised as a leader and a spokeswoman for the American feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was involved in the ultimately unsuccessful fight in the 1970s to pass the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution which is what Mrs PERIOD America was based on PERIOD

Rose added I thought I knew about feminist history before that PERIOD Id read The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan and The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf so I thought I knew PERIOD And then I realised I know nothing PERIOD

Its a fascinating era thats largely undiscussed and undocumented PERIOD Events like the womens conference in Houston in  had a huge influence on politics and administrations PERIOD The fact the Equal Rights Amendment was never ratified meaning its actually not in the US constitution that women have equal rights as men PERIOD Whats so scary about being equal Whys that such a dangerous and terrifying thing for people to embrace
