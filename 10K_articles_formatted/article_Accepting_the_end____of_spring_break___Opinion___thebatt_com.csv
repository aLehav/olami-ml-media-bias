Economics sophomore and news editor Luke Henkhaus shares tips on getting back into a school mindset after the break PERIOD

Another spring break has come and gone and as much as we hate to admit it its time to shake off the sand cover up that embarrassing new tattoo and return to reality PERIOD If youre like me a solid week off can make you forget you were ever even enrolled in school so coming back to class can be severely disorienting to say the least PERIOD Luckily there are a few useful things you can do to make the adjustment just a little bit easier PERIOD

 PERIOD Take a walk around campus

Even if your brain understands that spring break is over it can be tough to get the rest of your body to cooperate PERIOD Taking a nice stroll through some familiar campus locations can help you readjust to your surroundings and start rebuilding your academic routine PERIOD If youve been away for a while its also a great chance to experience iconic campus landmarks from a fresh perspective PERIOD Why not walk through the cool shade of Military Walks noble oak trees examine the intricate metal designs on the doors of the Administration Building or go to Heldenfels and see some  bricks I guess

 PERIOD Reorganize your room

If you had to tear apart your entire bedroom to find that other flipflop now is a great time to tidy things up PERIOD Naturally this means different things for different people so if being able to see your floor is an accomplishment for you then go ahead and take pride in that PERIOD Taking control of your living space by cleaning and organizing can help you feel more at home and connected with your surroundings PERIOD Its also a great opportunity to listen to music podcasts or audiobooks PERIOD If youre feeling extra redass the Fightin Texas Aggie Band has a pretty cool album on Spotify PERIOD

 PERIOD Start a healthy sleep schedule

Random naps and spontaneous allnighters can be awesome when youre on spring break but with the return of your usual school schedule it really helps to get on some kind of solid sleep routine PERIOD You probably know what works best for you based on how your body handles sleep and when your classes are but the most important thing to keep in mind for everyone is consistency PERIOD You might think sticking to a bedtime makes you seem too much like a kid or a senior citizen but your body and your grades will thank you later PERIOD

 PERIOD Get started on that thing

You know the one PERIOD That thing youve been putting off Maybe you said youd work on it over the break but its probably safe to say that didnt work out PERIOD Whether its that colossal research project the paper thats worth  percent of your grade or maybe just your FAFSA the time is now PERIOD The day is today PERIOD Well .. PERIOD maybe not today today 

 PERIOD See the light at the end of the semester

As if there werent already enough things to love about spring break it also serves as a convenient halfway point for the semester PERIOD If you feel good about what youve done so far just keep it up and finish strong PERIOD If youre less than pleased with that first half take this opportunity to leave the past behind and make the changes you need to salvage the semester PERIOD March is more than halfway over and April is going to fly right by too PERIOD So take comfort in the fact that its all downhill from here PERIOD

Steepness and method of travel down the hill may vary based on habits major employment and any number of other factors PERIOD Good luck PERIOD
