Working diligently to fill open positions PERIOD

Stanford Dining faces the same significant recruiting challenges as other employers in the Bay Area and is pursuing several avenues to recruit and retain skilled workers including seeking referrals from employees and the Union to identify qualified candidates PERIOD We also regularly participate in job fairs and work with local colleges trade and high schools and community organizations to recruit talented staff PERIOD

We rely on casual and temporary employees to fill vacancies and encourage them to apply for regular positions which are posted in the dining halls and online PERIOD Indeed a significant number of our current regular employees initially worked at the University as casual employees PERIOD We also encourage students to apply for positions to supplement staff in our dining halls PERIOD

Compensation set by Union contract PERIOD

The University has negotiated a contract with SEIU Local  that covers the frontline staff of Stanford Dining including wages benefits and other terms of their employment PERIOD Under that contract Dining staff receive comprehensive health insurance retirement benefits and wages consistent with Stanfords living wage program with a builtin increase each year PERIOD

We are proud of the compensation provided to our valued employees PERIOD It is important to note that our dining program is funded from meal plan purchases by students faculty and staff and not by the University endowment PERIOD

Dining workers have opportunities for training and promotion PERIOD

Our employees have many opportunities to learn develop and be promoted. for example

These are just a few of the training and development programs offered by Stanford Dining to our staff to provide opportunities for them to advance in their careers PERIOD

Working conditions

Stanford Dining is committed to provide a safe and respectful workplace for our employees and as issues arise in the workplace to investigate concerns raised and take all appropriate remedial measures PERIOD We are deeply concerned about allegations made in the Daily about unfair treatment of our workers PERIOD Unfortunately many of these concerns have not been raised with Stanford Dining either formally through the grievance procedure or informally through our discussions with the Union PERIOD

Under both our agreement with the Union and University policy the Union or employees may directly raise concerns of unfair treatment at work PERIOD The Union may also raise concerns about workplace issues during our monthly summits between Stanford Dining and the Union this is the agreed upon process PERIOD We encourage the Union to raise any concerns directly with Stanford Dining so that they can be addressed PERIOD We also want to reassure our employees that they may raise concerns without fear of retaliation PERIOD

The way forward

The entire Stanford Dining team cares about the students we serve and we appreciate the interest and concern that students have raised PERIOD

We encourage you to get to know the staff in your dining halls  frontline workers managers and Dining Ambassadors  to gain a complete perspective on their work PERIOD We also encourage the ASSU Senate and the Graduate Student Council to engage in a process that ensures thorough research in this case hearing from employers like Stanford Dining before drawing conclusions and recommending action PERIOD

Our goal is always to enhance the work environment for our staff PERIOD We want to answer your questions and we welcome your ideas about how to recruit more talented staff regular and student positions PERIOD A number of our most successful programs began as ideas brought to us by students PERIOD

On behalf of the entire Stanford Dining team thank you for your support. we look forward to continuing to provide a supportive workplace for our staff and to serving you and the entire Stanford community PERIOD
