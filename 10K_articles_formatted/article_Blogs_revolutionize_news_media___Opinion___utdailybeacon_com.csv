Over the past few years a new strange sounding word has entered into our vocabulary PERIOD You wont find it in any dictionary save for the most recent one PERIOD Not even Microsoft Word recognizes it PERIOD Yet it is fast becoming a household word PERIOD This new word is blog. the word blog is short for Web log and it what its name implies an online diary or journal that is updated frequently PERIOD There are millions of blogs on the Web today and the topics they cover are just as diverse as the bloggers who run them PERIOD Some cover politics PERIOD Some cover religion PERIOD Some cover their owners private life PERIOD Some are humorous PERIOD But they are all in their own way influencing our culture in ways most of us do not fully appreciate PERIOD

If not for blogs Trent Lott would probably still be Senate Majority Leader PERIOD It was bloggers who first pounced on his controversial comments at Strom Thurmonds birthday party PERIOD If not for bloggers Dan Rather would probably also still be hosting the CBS Evening News as it was bloggers who exposed the Bush National Guard files as forgeries PERIOD

As one surfs the Net you can find blogs to cover just about any interest PERIOD The most famous of all blogs is Instapundit httpwww.instapundit.com run by UT law professor Glenn Reynolds PERIOD Talk show host Hugh Hewitts blog httpwww.hughhewitt.com is likely the most popular rightwing blog PERIOD The Daily Kos httpwww.dailykos.com leads the pack among leftwing blogs PERIOD These blogs receive over a hundred thousand hits per day but there are many other blogs who get far fewer hits that are also worthy of attention PERIOD Among them are countless UT students who post their thoughts every day PERIOD

What has caused this massive surge in blogging Part of it stems from disenchantment with the mainstream media PERIOD For years conservatives have complained that the mainstream media has a liberal bias PERIOD With the rise of talk radio and FOX News some liberals are now also getting into the act arguing that the media in fact has a conservative bias instead PERIOD Then of course there are libertarians Greens socialists and others who rarely even get mentioned in the newspapers or on television PERIOD As a result these malcontents from all over the political spectrum have taken matters into their own hands and have begun posting the news they see fit to print PERIOD Then there are countless blogs dedicated to reporting on a single topic like a political campaign  httpbloggingforbryant.blogspot.com or on regions of the globe that are often overlooked on the nightly news like Africa  httpafricapundit.blogspot.com PERIOD

That blogs are numerous and influential is not in question PERIOD But whether or not they are a positive influence is PERIOD It has been said that the best and worst thing about blogs is that they have no editor PERIOD Anyone is free to publish anything they want  regardless of whether it is accurate PERIOD On the one hand you get pure unfiltered news and thoughts PERIOD But with this comes the possibility that what you are reading is untrue or exaggerated PERIOD How can you tell the difference

Fortunately it is not that difficult PERIOD First of all blogs with a political agenda are easy to spot PERIOD Most are very upfront about their political leanings PERIOD And having a political agenda does not make one dishonest provided they are honest about their biases PERIOD

Of course publishing news that one knows is untrue is dishonest PERIOD This certainly happens and is why one must be careful PERIOD Finding reliable news sources in blogosphere takes time and effort PERIOD Trust must be built between the blogger and his or her audience PERIOD But this is true of all news sources PERIOD The hosts of the nightly news programs on ABC NBC and CBS have built trust with their audience which they are slowly losing or not so slowly as is the case with Dan Rather PERIOD Reading a wide range of blogs from across the political field will also give one a chance to check their stories against each other PERIOD

As blogs become more popular many mainstream media sources are beginning to utilize them as well PERIOD In fact the Knoxville News Sentinel now has a blog httpblogs.knoxnews.comknxsilence maintained by reporter Michael Silence PERIOD

Those interesting in Tennessee blogs should check out the Rocky Top Brigade httpsouthknoxbubba.netrockytopbrigade.htm led by prominent Knoxville blogger South Knox Bubba httpwww.southknoxbubba.netskblog PERIOD Among Tennessees best blogs and by this I do mean my favorites are the aforementioned Instapundit Michael Silence and South Knox Bubba Bill Hobbs httpwww.billhobbs.com AlphaPatriot httpwww.alphapatriot.comhomeindex.php Lance in Iraq httpiraq.billhobbs.com Simply I httpadamgroves.netblog Nashville Files httpwww.nashvillefiles.comblog Nashville Truth httpnashvilletruth.blogspot.com and South End Grounds httpwww.southendgrounds.com PERIOD

Then there is my blog you knew Id get it in somewhere at httpjohnnorrisbrown.comblog which I feel is worth a look
