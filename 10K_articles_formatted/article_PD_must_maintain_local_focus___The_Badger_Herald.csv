2801,2009-04-15,"this most recent election cycle was not a positive one for principled progressives PERIOD The representation of Madisons local leftist party Progressive Dane on the Common Council was cleanly chopped in half its number of seats dropping from 6to3 PERIOD While the moderate Democratic establishment will now be happy to push aside a broader social agenda in favor of basic services anyone who casually follows local politics knows what this really means Advocacy for marginalized groups  people of color poor people working people tenants the homeless students  will weaken and Madisons progressive reputation will become even more undeserved PERIOD

To take but one example the recent bus fare increase loudly championed by Mayor Dave Cieslewicz would have been impossible had more progressives  i.e PERIOD supporters of public transportation  sat on the council PERIOD The 50cent or  percent increase is now widely acknowledged as having been unnecessary given the falling gas prices and the Metros unexpected multimillion dollar surplus PERIOD It will likely end up counterproductive as well as the increase in prices will decrease ridership and eventually revenue as well PERIOD But most importantly the monumental increase will disenfranchise poor people and undocumented immigrants  who can no longer obtain a drivers license in Wisconsin  forcing them to choose between getting to work and basic necessities PERIOD

The last council vote on the increase was a close one with  voting in favor and eight against PERIOD The opposition was exclusively comprised of the Councils diminishing progressive bloc including the six members of the PD caucus and two allies  including student alder Eli Judge District  PERIOD The mayors behavior in pushing for the increase is now infamous among local political insiders  even threatening the positions of the Transportation and Parking Commission for disagreeing with him and repeatedly spreading misinformation about the Metros financial situation PERIOD Regardless the increase happened because there simply werent enough allies of public transportation and economically disadvantaged people on the Council PERIOD Now that the number of progressives has even further decreased we can expect such attacks on public services to intensify to the detriment of the disenfranchised PERIOD

As astute observers have noted the strength of the left  as opposed to the moderates  in Madison is always cyclical so the political scenery will undoubtedly reconstruct itself in the coming years right alongside the development in the downtown area PERIOD Still this time around stalwart progressives underwent a setback at least partially due to an unexpectedly vociferous backlash from what must be called the citys establishment PERIOD Nowhere was this clearer than in the District  alder race in which incumbent Brenda Konkel was narrowly defeated by political newcomer Bridget Maniaci PERIOD

The District  alder race unambiguously had less to do with Maniaci  whose political credentials consist of her oneyear internship at the Mayors office and membership in Hoofers  than with Konkels eightyear record on the Council PERIOD An unabashed ally of the homeless tenants and transparent government Konkel was targeted for defeat by the citys powerful interests  most notably the Mayor landlords and the Police Union who spent thousands of dollars attacking her in student newspapers on billboards and through slanderous campaign literature PERIOD In the end the moderates and reactionaries achieved victory PERIOD Maniaci who identifies as a pragmatic progressive whatever that means must be feeling proud for allowing herself to be used by the cops and business interests to unseat one of the councils most distinguished proponents of social justice PERIOD

Local politics offers a wider opening for progressives to advocate for their issues which is precisely why an independent grassroots party like Progressive Dane is able to sustain a presence in Madison and the surrounding community PERIOD The focus for the left must be local PERIOD Antiwar demonstrations and protests against the corporate bailouts certainly have their value but in absence of any mass social movement something which cannot be manufactured even by the most intelligent and committed activists such actions will not have any immediate tangible affect PERIOD

The local political scene especially with an infrastructure like PD enables the possibility of measurable progressive change  even if on a smaller scale PERIOD PD and other progressives have been successful on issues as diverse as increasing the Madison minimum wage to creating a sistercounty relationship with Andrs Eloy Blanco Venezuela PERIOD Keeping the focus local allows even a small group of dedicated people to fight for appealing ideals of equality and justice while still partaking in the relevant political debate  something which is exponentially harder to do on a state and especially national level PERIOD

The impetus for UW and Madison progressiveactivists to focus on university and citycounty politics is in light of the recent conservative backlash now greater than ever PERIOD The cops and landlords will be relentless in pushing their agenda in the city and it is now especially crucial that progressives be at least as aggressive in advocating theirs PERIOD
