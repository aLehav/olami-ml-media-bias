There was little doubt in the mind of Michigan basketball coach Tommy Amaker that freshman swingman Lester Abram would play an important role for the Wolverines this year PERIOD

But with a bevy of players stocked up at the shooting guard and small forward positions it was unclear how soon Abram would earn significant minutes PERIOD

Following his performances in Michigans two exhibition games the youngster has made it difficult to keep him out of the lineup PERIOD

In the first start of his career Abram poured in  points in  minutes  the most on the team  last Friday in Michigans  victory over Nike Elite PERIOD That came on the heels of an impressive 13point sevenrebound showing in the Wolverines first exhibition win against Wayne State on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

I think hes shown to be a pretty effective player this far for a young kid Amaker said PERIOD I dont talk about him and thats a good thing I can count on PERIOD Thats a very comforting thing to say but its a little unnerving because hes a freshman and freshmen will be up and down PERIOD

But hes been fairly consistent. that evergrowing consistency looks like it will make it increasingly difficult for sophomore Dommanic Ingerson and senior tricaptain Gavin Groninger to find minutes at the shooting guard spot PERIOD

Ingerson has played just five minutes in the Wolverines two contests while Groninger played  minutes against Wayne State but dropped to  against Nike Elite PERIOD

It was just how we played it for our exhibition Amaker said PERIOD We have competition and have depth and I like that PERIOD What were trying to find are the guys that complement our key guys  thats what were doing were looking at complements PERIOD

Its a long horse race PERIOD Just because getting a lot of minutes may not happen today or tomorrow who knows whos going to be injured or sick or in foul trouble PERIOD You have to be sure when opportunity knocks for you that youre ready. despite the number of minutes Amaker has played Abram so far  and how impressed he claims he has been with the freshmans play  the Michigan coach insists that just because Abram might see the court a lot doesnt necessarily mean that Groninger and Ingerson will be relegated to the bench PERIOD

In football youll have a depth chart at positions but for us we dont coach that way Amaker said PERIOD We have a style and a system where different guys can play together in combinations depending on our opponents PERIOD

We have post guys and perimeter guys and we mix and match accordingly. hoping to heal The Wolverines are crossing their collective fingers in hopes that the warm Virgin Islands climate will help heal the teams wounds when Michigan heads down there for the seasonopening Paradise Jam this weekend PERIOD

Graham Brown who played just six minutes against Nike Elite continued to be bothered by a lower back injury PERIOD But had the injuries stopped there Amaker might consider himself lucky PERIOD

Instead Brown was joined on the list of the Wolverines walking wounded by center Chris Hunter and forwards LaVell Blanchard and Bernard Robinson PERIOD

Amaker said that Hunter had been sick on Monday and that his status for practice this week was up in the air PERIOD

Blanchard meanwhile continues to struggle with his ankle problems while Robinsons foot was bothering him and Abram was dealing with an unspecified injury PERIOD

Im going to try and find out whos available and then well go accordingly Amaker said PERIOD Were a little banged up. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
