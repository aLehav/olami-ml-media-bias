Two hundred people packed Connelly Center to participate in a One Day University event on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD This is the second year the University has hosted the event PERIOD

One Day University selects the best professors from  schools to speak at events PERIOD One Day considers awards and student recommendations to determine candidates according to One Day University CoFounder Steven Schragis PERIOD

Schragis compared the speakers of One Day to an allstar team PERIOD He also highlighted their diverse range of subjects and teaching styles as a key element in satisfying audiences PERIOD

The different speakers each brought something different to the table ensuring there was be something for everyone according to Schragis PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Nancy Kelley initially contacted One Day about hosting an event at Villanova PERIOD At that time there was no One Day in the Philadelphia area PERIOD Villanova became the seventh site out of now  cities hosting One Day events according to Schragis PERIOD

Kelley said One Day usually draws former college students ranging from their 40s to 70s PERIOD The attendees are largely local residents PERIOD They attend because they are seeking intellectual stimulation as they experienced during college PERIOD

Both Kelley and Schragis identified the event as a service to the area and local residents PERIOD There is a large demand among graduates to once again be part of a stimulating college experience which was evident by the soldout event PERIOD

Schragis also pointed to attendees shifting priorities to explain enthusiasm for One Day events PERIOD

For many their children are grown and out of the house and less time is devoted to their careers PERIOD

Their focuses shift and they are interested in learning for learnings sake PERIOD Kelley said that although a fair number of alumni were present they do not form a majority of the audience PERIOD One Day University increases interaction between Villanova and the people living in the surrounding areas according to Kelley PERIOD
