UWIRE AMHERST Mass PERIOD  On Sunday Nov PERIOD  I returned to my
dorm after a long weekend to find the bulletin boards filled with
holiday announcements PERIOD

The Office of Jewish Affairs had many posters displaying
holidays that are sometimes drowned out by the ChristianCorporate
Christmas hoopla PERIOD I looked at all the posters PERIOD Each offered
information on a different holidaymost alien to Americansfrom the
WiccanPagan Yule celebration to the African Kwanzaa
festivities PERIOD

The posters were not  to sway young and
impressionable college students to abandon their religions PERIOD They
were not devaluing Christianity or even America but when I passed
by the bulletin board later on in the evening someone had spit on
a poster displaying the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and scrawled
the words  across it PERIOD

That my friends is a hate crime PERIOD

I know that some rightwing readers and other misinformed
individuals are shouting  Well for those of you who
have not examined your freedom of speech lets discuss it PERIOD In this
country you may say whatever you want you may voice your opinion
no matter how foolish narrow minded inaccurate or outdated it
may be The KKK Aryan Nation and the Christian Right are living
proof of this PERIOD

However your freedom ends when you endanger the safety of
someone else PERIOD For example you cannot go into an airport and even
joke about having a bomb in your carry on bag because of the past
and present security breaches that have endangered civilians PERIOD You
cannot stand up in your biology lecture and threaten to kill
someone because you are then endangering their safety and you
cannot use racial slurs whether spoken or written against someone
of a different ethnicity gender religion or sexual orientation
because you endanger that persons well being PERIOD Case closed PERIOD

I looked at the other posters which were not altered in any
way and I suddenly understood the motive behind this crime PERIOD
American patriotism is rising in direct proportion with
antiIslamicArab sentiments due to the Sept PERIOD  attacks PERIOD

The reaction of Americans to ArabIslamic peoples can be taken
straight from the  We see the face of Osama bin Laden on every newspaper
magazine and television screen most depicting bin Laden
surrounded by a gun targeting graphic PERIOD When we see this face every
day connected to such a largescale murder and ensuing rage anger
and sadness his features begin to blur into an image that is not
the face of bin Laden the individual but of every Islamic person
male and female adult and childit is sickening PERIOD Americans are
ushering in an old era of racism reminiscent of World War II and
justifying it based on the deaths of people on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

I believe the person who defaced the poster did so with the same
hatred that people have displayed all over the country and all over
campus PERIOD Suddenly if you arent wearing your American flag cape you
are antiAmerican PERIOD If you are not white or if you appear to be God
help you of Arab descent you are the enemy of all red white and
blueblooded Americans PERIOD This is wrong PERIOD

Some readers may think that this is an isolated incident or not
directed specifically at Islamic people but I will ask of these
readers and of the perpetrators assuming they read this why not
deface all of the posters Why was the Ramadan poster the only one
targeted

I think that the present climate of the United States answers
that question PERIOD We want to justify our hatred based on the deaths of
thousands of people PERIOD We want to get even with the dead suicide
bombers so we choose to generalize people that are from the same
area of the world PERIOD We throw around words like  and 
to describe our attackers when in the same breath we are just as
cowardly and evil as those who have killed our people when we write
racial slurs on a university poster in black pen PERIOD

The Resident Director of my building took down the poster to
report the incident PERIOD I must express compassion for Resident
Directors everywhere who must bear the burden of removing posters
and writing reports the burden being the sight of stupid racism or
inappropriateness PERIOD

I guess that is the route of action reporting incidents PERIOD That
defaced poster was on the board for all to see for at least 
hours PERIOD No one reported it to an R.A. no one even took it down
because they were offended PERIOD Maybe no one was offended except me PERIOD
The nation needs to assess the racism that has erupted after the
attacks PERIOD

We as students must be informed so that we dont harbor biased
opinions or decide to take it upon ourselves to flex our patriotic
muscle by writing stupid things on religious posters PERIOD We also must
continue to report hate crimes to the authorities so that the
legislators and the public can see the evil that exists in our
minds and hearts PERIOD Seeing that defaced poster made me think of
America and its pledge of allegiance in the post Sept PERIOD 
world
