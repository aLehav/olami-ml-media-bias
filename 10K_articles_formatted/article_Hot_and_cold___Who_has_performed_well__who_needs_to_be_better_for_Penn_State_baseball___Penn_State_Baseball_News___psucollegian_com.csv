Nearly halfway through its season Penn State has seen its fair share of ups and downs from its roster as it currently sits at eleventh in the Big Ten at  PERIOD

The Nittany Lions first series was a solid display that ended in a split but it would take five weekends until they clinched their first series win against Rutgers PERIOD

Coach Rob Coopers squad has seen inconsistency from both its offense and defense but each component of the team helped the blue and white put together its most complete performances in its past two series against the Scarlet Knights and Michigan PERIOD

Seventeen games in heres a look at who has exceeded expectations and who needs to step up his game PERIOD

Conor Larkin has undoubtedly been the best pitcher on Coopers staff thus far PERIOD He leads the teams usual trio of starters with a . eRA PERIOD

Larkin has been suffocating to hitters only allowing a . batting average to his opponents in his outings PERIOD He also leads the team with  strikeouts on the year PERIOD

Despite his strong start to the campaign Larkins record sits at a relatively poor  mark PERIOD Still he has given the Nittany Lions every opportunity to hang in the games he started PERIOD

Penn State is hardly a stranger to the big dance PERIOD

Cole Bartels played hero in Penn States upset of thenNo PERIOD  Michigan with a walkoff slap bunt that skipped just out of the reach of the Wolverines third baseman PERIOD

However Bartels season hasnt consisted of many fairytale endings like that one PERIOD

He has taken control of the everyday first baseman role but his . batting average and . oPS rank last among Nittany Lion batters with  of games played and three plate appearances per game PERIOD

Cooper tried to experiment with Bartels batting leadoff for a few games but it wasnt enough to get the redshirt junior going PERIOD

First base is a position typically known for its plethora of power hitters and RBI machines PERIOD

At this juncture in the season Bartels hasnt been either but he could be a key piece to help the Nittany Lions turn their season around PERIOD

After a 2for12 weekend in the season opener against Northwestern Justin Williams buckled down at the plate and now leads Penn State with a . batting average PERIOD

Williams has provided solid power and production to Coopers squad from the threehole for most of the season PERIOD

Penn State is getting ready for its regular season finale with one word on its mind  humility PERIOD

Cooper said Tyler Shingledeckers  numbers were videogamelike. that hasnt quite been the case so far in  PERIOD

Against Michigan Shingledecker put together a shutout performance to help Penn State to the upset in Game  but he blew up in Game  by issuing three walks in an outing that only lasted four batters PERIOD

Shingledeckers ERA sits at . and he has given up nine earned runs in just  innings of work PERIOD

Coopers bullpen has been one of the rockier areas of the teams performance so far but its clear Cooper still trusts Shingledecker with the ball in tight situations PERIOD He will need his lefty setup man to figure it out in order to propel the blue and white to a few more tight wins PERIOD

Like Williams Johnny Piacentino had a bit of a slow start to the season PERIOD He went just 1for4 in the first game against Northwestern but shined in the final game of the series with three home runs PERIOD

Piacentino has been arguably the most consistent source of production for Penn States offense as he leads the team in home runs  RBIs  OPS . and runs scored  PERIOD

He and Williams have been an elite onetwo punch for Cooper at the top of the order so far this season PERIOD Piacentino is also sporting a perfect . fielding percentage with the most putouts on the team PERIOD
