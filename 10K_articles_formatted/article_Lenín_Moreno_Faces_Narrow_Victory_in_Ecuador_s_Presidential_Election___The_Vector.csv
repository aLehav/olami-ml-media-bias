7283,2023-11-04,"leftist candidate Lenn Moreno won a narrow victory in Ecuadors most recent presidential race over his opponent Guillermo Lasso PERIOD Moreno the former vice president of Rafael Correa current president of Ecuador overall led  percent over Lassos  percent PERIOD Lassos supporters insist the election process was fraudulent on multiple levels to ensure the victory of Moreno PERIOD Clashes broke out in several cities including the capital Quito where protestors on the streets demanded another recount PERIOD

Prior to his victory Moreno did not seal his win in the first round only receiving roughly  percent of the vote PERIOD In order to win a candidate must either win  percent of the vote or take  percent of the vote and be at least  percent ahead of the runner up PERIOD

This election cycle has marked deep divisions in Ecuadors society PERIOD Lenn Moreno represents the leftist current that swept over South America within the last decade PERIOD Lasso on the other hand offered a message of change and tapped into voters frustrations about the countrys declining economy and the governments corruption PERIOD Lasso also offered to open Ecuadors economy to the free market PERIOD In South America a new political wave has surged in which free market candidates have won recent elections in countries such as Argentina and Peru PERIOD Morenos victory in a way defies Latin Americas shift to right PERIOD

The election was subject to worldwide attention especially due to the power Ecuadors new President would have on the future of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange PERIOD Assange took refuge at Ecuadors embassy in London in  PERIOD The opposing candidate Lasso said he would evict Assange from the embassy within  days PERIOD Moreno has said he will let Assange stay PERIOD Julian Assange is wanted by Swedish authorities and possibly will face extradition to the US on espionage charges PERIOD

Ecuadors economic situation has worsened and there are serious questions about the government corruption PERIOD The voters that stuck with the leftist Moreno recognized the governments high investment in education health care and infrastructure in recent years by leftist candidates PERIOD The narrow results only suggest that Moreno would face fierce challenges in governing in an increasingly volatile and divided country PERIOD
