Davis students offer their perspectives on the effectiveness of the tradition

By CLARA FISCHER  artstheaggie.org

As a new year dawns before us there is one certainty it brings with it  the onset of a slew of resolutions made in good faith by people seeking to better some aspect of their life PERIOD

The tradition of making New Years resolutions dates back to Babylonian times and has evolved from the making of religious promises to a secular practice of selfimprovement PERIOD

This tradition seems harmless enough and it can even be argued that there is some benefit to a majority of the population seeking to improve something about themselves PERIOD

However statistics have shown that only  of those who make resolutions actually stick to them after  days and a mere  of those who declare resolutions actually end up accomplishing them PERIOD

Ive found that when I attempted to make New Years resolutions Id just be disappointed that I hadnt done them said Elizabeth Woodhall a secondyear English and psychology double major via Facebook Messenger PERIOD

So how do people get started on and more importantly stay committed to this journey of selfimprovement

There needs to be some other motivating factor behind a change in your lifestyle said Kiara Kunnes a thirdyear international relations major PERIOD People are able to make changes without that but the most successful lasting transformations do have an underlying cause. she may be right  New Years resolutions are notoriously easy to give up on PERIOD According to The New York Times resolutions tend to fall through due to their being too vague being made for the wrong reasons i.e PERIOD what society wants the resolutionmaker to do rather than what the individual themselves wants to do or being too unrealistic PERIOD

But can there really be harm in setting a positive goal for yourself with the onset of a fresh new year Connie Wang a secondyear political science major doesnt think so PERIOD

I think New Years resolutions let people reflect on any improvements they want to see in their life which is always good Wang said PERIOD

While it may be true that resolutions provide a convenient opportunity for many to reflect on what in their lives may need improvement the general consensus seems to be that longlasting change is not likely to come from them PERIOD

I dont typically make New Years resolutions Kunnes said PERIOD I dont see a need to  Im generally a person that will make a change at the moment that I want to make it. reagan Campbell a secondyear English major had a different take on the matter PERIOD

Overall I believe that New Years resolutions can start your year off on a positive note  however its more about whether or not you have the willpower to actually follow through with them Campbell said PERIOD

Her viewpoint succinctly summarizes it Anyone can make a resolution but it will only be beneficial to those who actually set realistic goals and are willing to put in the necessary work to see them through PERIOD

That being said even just setting a goal for yourself can be considered a win and after these past two years every victory however large or small deserves to be celebrated PERIOD
