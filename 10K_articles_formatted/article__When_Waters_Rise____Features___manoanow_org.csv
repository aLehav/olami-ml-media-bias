In  Hurricane Harvey was the first highcategory storm to hit the U.S PERIOD since  PERIOD According to the nonprofit organization World Vision an estimated  million people were affected and  homes were damaged or destroyed PERIOD The ensuing hurricane Irma was classified as a Category  hurricane leaving many Caribbean Islands and southern U.S PERIOD states without power or homes PERIOD As these devastating events took place Professor Mary Babcocks Fall Woven Structure ART 237students turned to weaving as a peaceful way to encourage discussion regarding global warmings contributions to sea level rise PERIOD Their work was then displayed at UH Mnoas February art gallery titled When Waters Rise. instead of thinking of boundaries as political boundaries that tend to highlight our separateness and divisions we highlighted something that we all share which is the need for water PERIOD But what happens when water goes the other way too said Babcock PERIOD

The process of weaving over a loom is slow and gradual allowing the students to absorb an issue for a long period of time and get lost in its emotional process PERIOD Professor Babcock wanted her students to explore various areas of the world where an excess or inadequate amount of water has not been publicized to emphasize that sea level rise is threatening the livelihood of many around the world PERIOD

The students chose music that would allow them to connect with people living in areas affected by water and understand how these natural disasters are impacting their daily lives PERIOD Babcock stated that the melody of the music chosen was a sort of translation of one art form of music into another weaving PERIOD

Professor Babcock disclosed that the title of the art gallery When Waters Riseis presented as a question to motivate the audience to have an open discussion pertaining to the rising sea level and ways to combat global warming PERIOD



I think there is a preventative measure that can be taken towards global warming PERIOD Although it wouldnt pay off as easily as a beach clean up .. PERIOD its something that has to be taken into account everywhere like the whole burning of trash and the way we dispose of it said student Catherina Guerero PERIOD

If you would like to see more of UH Mnoas art galleries visit The Extended Hawaiian Body where students portray the metaphorical extension of the collective Hawaiian body and its response to colonialism PERIOD The Extended Hawaiian Body will be on display at the John Young Museum of Art from March  to May  Monday to Friday from    p.m PERIOD
