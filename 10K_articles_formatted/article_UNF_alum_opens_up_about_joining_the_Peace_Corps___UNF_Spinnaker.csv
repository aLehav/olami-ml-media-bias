Daniel Woodhouse a founder of the Kappa Gamma Chapter of Theta Chi graduated from UNF last year PERIOD In June  he joined the Peace Corps and by September he was sent overseas PERIOD Today he teaches English to high school students at a vocational school in Antsirabe the third largest city on the island of Madagascar PERIOD

Spinnaker talked to Woodhouse over Skype to find out more about working on the other side of the world PERIOD

Spinnaker What is it that you do with the Peace Corps

Woodhouse I am in the Education Branch of the Peace Corps PERIOD My primary project is to teach technical English to high school students PERIOD Anything else I want to do is considered a secondary project PERIOD I also volunteer at a local Norwegian Missionary center where I teach English PERIOD I also have another project I am currently working on which is to help other teachers at my school learn English as well PERIOD I work in the fourth poorest country in the world PERIOD Theres not a lot of opportunity but theres a lot of potential PERIOD A lot of my students are very smart and very motivated PERIOD I love hearing their stories. spinnaker How did you get involved in the Peace Corps

Woodhouse Initially when I graduated in  I wanted to join the Navy because I come from a military family PERIOD I also had a long history of public service PERIOD I sent my resume to Americorps the Red Cross and several other organizations PERIOD I got accepted into both Americorps and the Peace Corps but I ultimately decided to do the Peace Corps because I believe in serving my country and I wanted to get away for a little bit longer I wanted to do something different with my life. spinnaker How did you know that this was something right for you

Woodhouse When youre applying to something like this you really dont know if it is right for you PERIOD The Peace Corps is something where most people getting involved in it are fresh college graduates and dont really know much about the world PERIOD Personally I knew nothing about Madagascar before I came here PERIOD So for me it was not so much that I was prepared it was really that I wanted to challenge myself PERIOD I saw an opportunity. spinnaker What are your favorite parts about what you do

Woodhouse The thing I like about teaching the most is the fact that Im introducing something new into their lives PERIOD My favorite part of the day is when I can bring a smile to these kids faces I love being able to inspire them and make them laugh. spinnaker What are some challenges that you have face going into the Peace Corps

Woodhouse Once you pass the interview the legal clearance and the medical clearance theyre looking for potential and opportunity PERIOD That first three months is the PreService Training and thats the makeorbreak period PERIOD The most challenging part really is adjusting to a new environment PERIOD An environment where a lot of times there is no running water no electricity and no clean water at times PERIOD There might be high amounts disease You have to learn to live with less. spinnaker From the perspective of a former UNF student what do you think about the fact that UNF now offers a Peace Corps Prep Program

Woodhouse I support any effort that encourages young people like myself to serve their country in some capacity like the Peace Corps Americorps or the Red Cross PERIOD I also believe that organizations like the Peace Corps offer a great opportunity for people who are just coming out of college and dont have a lot of direction or dont know what job they want to do PERIOD The Peace Corps gives them an opportunity and can open a lot of doors for you if you complete the service. spinnaker Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in joining the Peace Corps

Woodhouse Before you do it you need to know that what youre making is a once in a lifetime opportunity but its also something that you need to prepare yourself for both mentally and physically PERIOD It is like joining the military because not only are you taking on a great humanitarian responsibility but you are representing the United States of America PERIOD Whether you know it or not your actions do have significant consequences PERIOD If you are interested do your research and talk to former volunteers PERIOD The Peace Corps is one of those opportunities that if youre looking to do something great not just for yourself but for your country Id say you should really look into it. the UNF Peace Corps Prep Program was offered for the first time at UNF this fall semester PERIOD Interested students may contact Dr PERIOD Tim Robinson the Peace Corps Prep advisor PERIOD
