You walk down Pedestrian Walkway listening to your iPod with the sun shining on your face and a cool breeze lightly patting you on the back PERIOD

The weather is near perfect you could walk outside in shorts and feel comfortable PERIOD

Youve had a long day but you managed to miraculously pull yourself through it PERIOD Seeing your friends throughout the day helped to put you into a happy mood though for the moment it seems as if everything is at peace PERIOD

However that peace is soon disrupted PERIOD Whether its someone who irritated you with a misplaced comment or an unexpected situation suddenly coming up you soon find your positive mood disrupted PERIOD

Brimming with anger or straddled by sadness youre overcome by your emotions PERIOD

We all have those moments in our lives when were happily enjoying life only to have it rudely thrown into chaos by unforeseen circumstances PERIOD Though we try to get past such problems we are still gripped by our emotions feeling mad sad and everything in between PERIOD When we do get past such mood swings it may take days or even weeks for us to get over them PERIOD

Our moods and emotions are influenced by multiple factors in our environment PERIOD Generally people feel more energetic and positive in sunny or calm weather PERIOD Depending on your personality and the people that you surround yourself with it may make it easier or harder for you to get control over your moods and thinking PERIOD

Your emotions are directly linked with your mind so if something is or has been bugging you for an extended period of time the higher the chance that youll continue to think about it until you take action on it PERIOD Ive found myself trying to avoid or ignore problems hoping they would go away PERIOD

Unfortunately by not doing anything my mind continually kept thinking back to it  by forcibly trying to hide the problems I actually continued to think about them and as a result the thoughts and the resultant bad moods kept occurring PERIOD

I was talking with several friends of mine about video games and an idea came up into my mind  what if we could make a save file of ourselves

We could  the current mood that were in and  into it later on when needed PERIOD When youre having a bad day you could simply search for a previous mood and instantly youd be happy again PERIOD

Of course reality is never as simple or convenient as that PERIOD

We shouldnt let our emotions rule us PERIOD Sure we enjoy having them but that doesnt mean that we should let it completely dictate how we act PERIOD We need to learn how to keep them under control PERIOD If we dont not only can it be embarrassing but it displays a lack of selfcontrol PERIOD

The focus is not necessarily what other people may think of you but how you may act in stressful and difficult situations PERIOD

How can you become successful in your future occupations if you cant stay calm Not all situations can be solved with brute force and verbal beatings  some require you to stay calm and collected and think beforehand PERIOD

Training yourself to keep your mind and attitude in check requires practice PERIOD Professional athletes take this to heart every day constantly honing their physical and mental strength PERIOD

Performing under pressure theyve learned how to break past negative emotions focusing solely on what they must do instead of what might be PERIOD

For those of us that arent them there are things that we can still do to train our mental and emotional fortitude PERIOD

Changing the types of people that you are around to ones with more positive and happier outlooks would doubtlessly help to give you some control on your moods PERIOD Taking time out of the day to tell yourself to  sounds a bit cheesy but it can help a lot in the long run PERIOD

Since each and every person is different however there are different methods of selfmotivation PERIOD

In the end though the point is there  dont let emotions control you PERIOD You control you nothing else PERIOD
