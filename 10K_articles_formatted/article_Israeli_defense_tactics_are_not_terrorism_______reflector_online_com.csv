Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I am writing to express my concern over Nathan Aldays Sept PERIOD  opinion piece concerning the ongoing struggle in the Middle East PERIOD

I feel that he has an obligation to represent at least some truth in his writing particularly given the potential to influence the students of this great university PERIOD

His piece as I saw it asserted two concepts

 PERIOD Israels response to terrorism is morally equivalent to the terrorist actions it is trying to combat PERIOD

 PERIOD Israel is inciting more violence through its commitment to target leaders of Hamas an organization known to plan and execute acts of terror PERIOD

Unlike Hamas Israel attempts to avoid the bloodshed of innocents PERIOD The strikes that are carried out target specific individuals that are known to belong to Hamas PERIOD These strikes do not target buses of women and children on their way to work and school PERIOD

There is no denying that many of the Israeli strikes have incurred an unacceptable amount of collateral damage but Hamas has killed far more innocents than Israel PERIOD

Aldays suggestion that targets of Israels most recent strikes might be innocent is absolute nonsense PERIOD Those targeted were known members of Hamas the same organization that routinely takes credit for attacks on Israeli citizens PERIOD

Regardless of what  of the organization the targets claimed to represent they were still members of a terrorist organization and could therefore never be classified as innocent PERIOD

The alternatives he offers to Israels current policy are unacceptable PERIOD Attempting to apprehend Hamas leaders would mean sending Israeli forces into Palestinian neighborhoods that would likely offer heavy resistance PERIOD This strategy would simply lead to more deaths of noncombatants caught in the crossfire of an unnecessary street war PERIOD

Furthermore his suggestion that Israel has an obligation to protect the rights of these Hamas leaders is indefensible given the total disregard Hamas displays toward the Geneva Convention PERIOD

If Israel were to extend the rights of combatants outlined in Geneva to an organization that makes no effort to follow its provisions then what reason would any group of combatants have to follow its provisions in the future Geneva was meant to protect soldiers fighting under the banner of a given country and abiding by the rules of combat not to extend rights to terrorists who recognize no rule of law PERIOD

Hamas committed hundreds of murders before Israel ever started its current round of targeted strikes PERIOD Hamas stated objective is the elimination of Israel as we know it and its leadership will not stop the cycle of terror until this goal is reached PERIOD

Israels only hope for survival is to root out those that orchestrate terror PERIOD

Israels new policy is simply a response to Abbas and Arafats unwillingness to fulfill the Palestinians obligation detailed in the Roadmap to Peace PERIOD

I do not suggest that Israel is in anyway perfect or that I even support the totality of its foreign policy PERIOD However I do feel strongly that the truth must be told PERIOD

It is my sincere hope and prayer that the new Palestinian leadership will show a greater degree of willingness to combat the terrorist infrastructure including Hamas and that a true and lasting peace might be reached PERIOD

In the meantime we should avoid equating Israels defense policy with terrorism PERIOD
