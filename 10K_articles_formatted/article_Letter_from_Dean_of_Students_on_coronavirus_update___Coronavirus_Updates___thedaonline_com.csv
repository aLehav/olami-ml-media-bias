WVU Dean of Students Corey Farris

Dear Mountaineer

I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your personal safety health and wellbeing PERIOD We are facing a public health crisis worldwide nationwide and here in West Virginia PERIOD

On behalf of the University and larger community I am asking for your help PERIOD If you are in Morgantown we ask that you return home and if you are at home please remain there and be ready to begin online classes on Monday March  PERIOD Courses that were fully online at the beginning of the semester should continue to follow the original syllabus PERIOD We recognize a small number of students may need to be in Morgantown due to unavoidable circumstances and we will continue to provide them support PERIOD We are strongly advising and requesting that students do not return to campus PERIOD

We are especially concerned right now if you are out and about PERIOD There are significant dangers posed by COVID19 PERIOD While you may not become sick or suffer only mild symptoms if you contract COVID19 you could infect those most atrisk who could become acutely ill PERIOD Please take steps to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus

Dr PERIOD Kathryn Moffett a WVU expert on infectious diseases discusses the importance of social distancing in this video PERIOD

We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to online instruction not only based on the health and welfare of you and your fellow students but also because we want to ensure that WVU Medicine is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months PERIOD Alleviating a population stress point will be better for our health system and thus for the health and welfare of everyone in the region PERIOD More than half of West Virginias population is considered most at risk and so anything we can do to protect our fellow citizens is of the utmost importance PERIOD

You will be hearing more from your professors and instructors soon about the transition to virtual classes PERIOD We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition PERIOD However faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible and you will have support from the University PERIOD

Thank you to each of you for your cooperation help and understanding PERIOD We know for many of our students this will cause an unexpected disruption and yet it is one step you can take to help keep yourself and your family safe PERIOD No matter where you reside our staff is available to help please dont hesitate to contact us PERIOD

In my  years working in higher education I have faced many crises yet none like this PERIOD This global pandemic is unlike anything previously seen by any of us PERIOD We know that Mountaineers come together to achieve great things and it is vital we unite around this crisis PERIOD The COVID19 pandemic is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes PERIOD In the end however it is not about us PERIOD Its about our responsibility to our fellow human beings PERIOD Thank you for all you are doing during this difficult time PERIOD

Finally please continue to check our coronavirus website which is being updated continually with new information coronavirus.wvu.edu or email coronavirusmail.wvu.edu PERIOD

Sincerely

G PERIOD Corey Farris Dean of Students
