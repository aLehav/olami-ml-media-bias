A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version







Last December the
Supreme Court decided it would include two cases on the  docket that would
have major implications on the status of samesex marriage in the United
States PERIOD The cases chosenUnited States v PERIOD Windsor and Hollingsworth v PERIOD Perrychallenge
the  Defense of Marriage Act DOMA and Californias Proposition 
respectively PERIOD

DOMA is a federal
law passed in  which defines marriage as between a man and a woman PERIOD
Proposition  is a California law which precludes samesex marriages PERIOD

According to the Petition
for Writ of Certiorari the formal request calling for a Supreme Court review
the Hollingsworth v PERIOD Perry case poses the question of whether the Equal
Protection Clause of the fourteenth Amendment prohibits the State of California from
defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. similarly the
petition in United States v PERIOD Windsor asks whether section  of DOMA violates
the Fifth Amendments guarantee of equal protection of the laws as applied to
persons of the same sex who are legally married under the laws of their state. the hearings began
on March  for Hollingsworth v PERIOD Perry and on March  for the United States v PERIOD
Windsor case PERIOD

Fiftyeight
percent of Americans think it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to
get married according to a Washington PostABC News poll conducted this month PERIOD
Among younger Americansthose ages  percent say they support gay
marriage according to the poll PERIOD

Reuters Ltd. a
British news agency reported that Chief Justice John Roberts alluded to the
evolving positions on the issue during oral arguments on Wednesday in one of
the cases citing political support for samesex marriage as evidence that gays
and lesbians were not a vulnerable group requiring special protections. as far as I
can tell political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of
the case Roberts said to Roberta Kaplan the lawyer representing Edith
Windsor a lesbian widow seeking federal benefits in one of the cases PERIOD

Charles Cooper
presented the argument on behalf of California PERIOD The concern is that redefining
marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its
historic traditional procreative purposes and it will refocusrefocus the
purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of
children and to the emotional needs and desires of adults Cooper said PERIOD

Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg pointed out that somebody who is locked up in prison and who is not
going to get out has a right to marry has a fundamental right to marry no
possibility of procreation so why not gay couples

Justice Ginsburg
also stated in the United States v PERIOD Windsor hearing that DOMA by denying
samesex couples federal benefits reduces samesex marriage to a sort of skim
milk marriage. although the justices
appeared likely to strike down the samesex marriage bans Reuters reported
that based on the arguments however a partial victory for gay rights
activists seems more likely than the sweeping declaration of samesex marriage
rights they had hoped for. the report notes
that while justices have expressed that they are not interested in impeding the
states from embracing samesex marriage they have also made it clear that they
will not be paving the way to marriage equality PERIOD

If the justices
decide to strike down DOMA legally married samesex couples would become
eligible for federal benefits that were previously denied PERIOD This denial of
benefits is what required Edith Windsor to pay  in
federal estate taxes which would not have been imposed if Windsors marriage
had been federally recognized PERIOD

According
to Reuters Justices gave a strong indication they might resolve the
Proposition  case on procedural grounds. if this happens samesex marriages
would likely resume in California PERIOD This rulings procedural grounds would have
no effect on the marriage laws of any other state PERIOD

While none of the justices definitively
said how they planned to rule Politico reported that if the court issues an
opinion in the case it likely would not come before June PERIOD
