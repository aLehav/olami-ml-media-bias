2309,2023-10-26,"illinois head basketball coach Bruce Weber used the phrase positive season to get things rolling at Tuesdays seasonending press conference PERIOD

His team goals of  wins and an NCAA Tournament appearance accomplished the national coach of the year finalist reflected on a  record after finishing  one season before PERIOD

I think you ask kids to make improvement Weber said PERIOD And we did that. not many people saw an NCAA Tournamentcaliber team in Illinois at the beginning of the season and not until it defeated Purdue  on the road in overtime did many start believing PERIOD This years success due in large part to senior leadership from Trent Meacham Chester Frazier and Calvin Brock was a far cry from dysfunction that ran amok at the Ubben Basketball Complex in  PERIOD Weber used a recipe for success built around solid defense and enthusiastic team play to turn things around PERIOD

A firstround exit in the NCAA Tournament is never a good thing but here are a few highlights from the season and thoughts from the head coach as the Illini face seven months before they play another meaningful game PERIOD



Most Improved

Weber had a hard time naming a mostimproved player saying the candidates for that award go five six players deep. although Weber didnt zero in on anyone one could make a great argument for Mike Davis and his . points and eight rebounds per game PERIOD One stat stands out nine doubledoubles after having none last season PERIOD

Biggest DifferenceMaker

Weber had no hesitations in labeling Frazier the biggest reason for the teams turnaround PERIOD The defensive stoppers importance was obvious when he was sidelined for the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA Tournament contest against Western Kentucky PERIOD Weber said Frazier should be able to return as a student assistant coach next season PERIOD

I think Chester has the respect of the guys Weber said PERIOD Still he cant be on the court PERIOD When you start playing pickup games and all that thats where its going to take somebody to take over that leadership role. best Game

It would be an easy call to go with the win at Purdue in late December but the teams comefrombehind  victory at Northwestern in February which should have been an easy win was fun to watch PERIOD Illinois trailed by  with a little more than  minutes left to play and guard Demetri McCamey led the comeback with  points including the gamewinning bank shot with . seconds left PERIOD

Best offthecourt moment

A bizarre press conference after a  win over Hawaii was the first glimpse of Dominique Keller really getting comfortable PERIOD

The fiery forward who would many more times run a marathon with his mouth sat at a table with Frazier and McCamey while animating his displeasure of how Frazier was perceived publicly as not having an offensive game PERIOD

I dont think its funny when people try to come at Chester and give him a hard time for missing shots he said PERIOD If it wasnt for Chester we wouldnt have won half the games weve played already. watching it all unfold was more confusing than anything else PERIOD While Frazier and McCamey held back laughs the whole time Keller sounded like he was almost in tears and at one point McCamey asked for a TV timeout PERIOD It was weird but hilarious PERIOD

Hypothetical

Who will have the bigger impact next season  Alex Legion Bill Cole or Stan Simpson A little background info for you Simpson redshirted this year Legion never really got on track after transferring from Kentucky and Cole found playing time late in the season PERIOD The floor is open for discussion PERIOD

Outlook for Next Year

The incoming freshmen are talented enough to replace the oncourt production Illinois loses from its departing seniors even if theyll lack the leadership PERIOD If Mike Davis and Mike Tisdale improve anywhere near as much as they did last summer the Illini will have an inside presence thats tough to match up against PERIOD In all Illinois should have enough role players to get the little things done while developing talent for the next several years PERIOD It should be interesting to watch PERIOD",Season in review: The 2008-09 basketball season - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
