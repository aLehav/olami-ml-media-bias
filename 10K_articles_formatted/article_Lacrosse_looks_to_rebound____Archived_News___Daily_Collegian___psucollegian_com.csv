Cornell dominated Canisius in their last outing in a  rout PERIOD They won  of  faceoffs against Canisius which set up their game PERIOD This statistic could be especially important considering the Lions were beat in faceoffs  against Georgetown PERIOD

 Thiel said PERIOD 

To reach the NCAA tournament the Lions will most likely need to win the ECAC but for any chance of receiving an atlarge bid the players know every high profile nonconference game like this one will count PERIOD

 senior Sean Droogan said PERIOD 

A player on each team is coming into the contest on a hot streak as Cornell sophomore Andrew Collins has eight goals in his last two games as does Penn State attacker Will Driscoll PERIOD

Cornell plays a similar style to the Lions as they also prefer to push the pace of the game PERIOD That is something that senior Tim Emmick felt that the Lions didnt do as well against Georgetown PERIOD

 Emmick said PERIOD
