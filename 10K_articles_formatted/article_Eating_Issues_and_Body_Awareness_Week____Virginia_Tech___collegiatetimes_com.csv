Eating disorders are frequently swept under the carpet and there is a stigma attached to having them she said PERIOD

According to Katherine Cruise Director of Communications and Marketing at Screening for Mental Health Inc. almost  of college students have eating disorders and nearly three quarters of those affected have never received treatment. eating disorders also have the highest mortality rate of all mental health victims. many affected also deal with depression anxiety and substance abuse at the same time PERIOD

The events planned for this week are aimed to combat these statistics PERIOD

The past couple of years Tech has been doing a lot more than they have in previous years during this national week of observance PERIOD

Our numbers have really increased and we are definitely raising awareness said Davis PERIOD

Events will begin Monday with Dying to be Barbie PERIOD A drawing of Barbie with her body dimensions will be displayed in the lobby of McComas PERIOD Students can view it to see that they are dimensions that no one can live up to PERIOD

Operation beautiful an annual event will also be occurring all week PERIOD People will be able to write positive notes about themselves and about their bodies PERIOD

Wednesday will have an eating issues and body image screening conducted by the Cook Counseling Center PERIOD

We used to call it Eating Disorders Screening but that really scares people off said Davis PERIOD Now people see it as something more general and they are not going to shy away from the screening. the name of the screening is now called Gauge your Eating Attitude. wednesday will also have an expo where students will have a wide variety of resources to help them deal with any body image or food issues they might have PERIOD Doctors dieticians mental health experts and representatives from rec sports will all be on hand to answer questions and provide counseling PERIOD Davis hopes these events will open up a dialogue about body issues PERIOD

We dont have to be quiet about this if someone has a friend they can find out ways to get that friend help PERIOD There is help and we need to be aware that it is a serious and life threatening problem she said PERIOD

The Keynote address is an event that has been completely filled in the past exclaimed Davis. bringing in these speakers that have recovered really brings a message of hope. kathleen MacDonald a previous keynote address speaker will be returning to speak as well PERIOD

MacDonald is a member of the F.R.E.E.D PERIOD For Recovery and Elimination of Eating Disorders and is a lobbyist and survivor working in Washington D.C PERIOD to get insurance companies to cover costs for patients with eating disorders when they need hospitalization of inpatient care PERIOD

Also many sororities and members of Resident Life will be in attendance at the event receiving credit for an educational event PERIOD

There is exceptional stress on college students to achieve in the classroom as well as have the perfect body PERIOD Living in close proximity to others of the same age also facilitates the growth of this stress PERIOD

According to Davis eating disorders are a manifestation of students coping with pressures PERIOD

College is a place where students can really erupt with eating disorders lamented Davis PERIOD Among other things the gym and people exercising in close proximity to others and trying to obtain this ideal body makes a lot of pressure just like the academic pressure PERIOD The social pressure from eating in the dining halls in such proximity to others triggers so many food choices and thats really difficult to decide what to eat and how to eat PERIOD

As part of the National Eating Disorders Awareness Week the company Screening for Mental Health began its first annual National Eating Disorders Screening Program public service announcement contest PERIOD

Freshman Lauren Webb a Studio Arts major here at Tech won third place with her entry to the PSA contest PERIOD
