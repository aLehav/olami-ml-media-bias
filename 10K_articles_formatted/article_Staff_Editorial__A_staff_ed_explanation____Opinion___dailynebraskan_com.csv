Staff editorials are tricky things PERIOD At their best they allow newspapers to rise above the sum of their parts and attain a stronger collective voice that can speak prophetically to power PERIOD

At their worst they became a laborious and tedious project dreaded by both the editorial board members who write them and the readers who quickly grow bored with them PERIOD

Obviously our hope for the year is that our editorials will more closely resemble the first option PERIOD Before we can even begin to achieve that though it will be helpful to lay out what a staff editorial is and what it is not PERIOD

To begin with the obvious staff editorials are unsigned PERIOD Though one member of our editorial board  all of whom are listed above  writes the editorial its contents are discussed and agreed upon by all members of the editorial board prior to its being written PERIOD Because these editorials represent collective opinions rather than individuals this changes what we can and cannot do in this space PERIOD

For starters it means no one persons agenda can dictate the content of the editorial PERIOD

This leads to greater diversity at least theoretically in what we can discuss PERIOD If a free press protects free society  as many wiser than any of us have already said  then editorial boards can protect the free press by serving as a check against one person becoming too dominant in the newsroom PERIOD

But sometimes it also will mean that we cannot offer the same kind of precise solutions to issues that you might find in a signed column PERIOD There are seven of us so even if we agree on a problem its doubtful well agree on every detail of the solution PERIOD

At times the disagreement will be sharp enough that we wont publish on an issue PERIOD For example last spring we wanted to write an editorial discussing Lincoln senator Tony Fultons bill requiring providers of abortion to show women an ultrasound before carrying out the procedure PERIOD But the staff was split and found that there was nothing we could agree on regarding Fultons controversial bill PERIOD

Thankfully such cases are the minority PERIOD Generally were all able to agree on some basic level in making a criticism and then offer some equallybasic ideas for how to address the issue PERIOD

Finally there are two other fundamental differences between what youll see here versus the rest of the opinion section PERIOD

First since this is a daily feature well be able to discuss many more events and issues PERIOD Our columnists write at the most on a weekly basis PERIOD This means they get four shots a month to say something PERIOD Well get about  PERIOD So if youre looking for commentary on a particular bill in the unicameral it might get addressed by a columnist but it will  assuming its controversial enough  almost certainly be addressed in a staff ed PERIOD

Second we have about half as much space as typical columns PERIOD This is both a blessing and a curse because it forces us to state our point succinctly but it also can inhibit our ability to do justice to the complexity of the issue were addressing PERIOD In those cases our comments will necessarily be more general PERIOD

So with that said look for our first editorial on Monday PERIOD
