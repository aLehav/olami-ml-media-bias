Updated November     pm



As finals week inches closer stress levels are at an alltime high PERIOD Rather than selfcombust under a mountain of homework and studying take a few minutes to enjoy Thundercats Friend Zone off his fantastic new album Drunk. friend Zone can best be described as the ultimate mashup of funky basslines and glitzy synth melodies PERIOD Thundercat laments about being stuck in the friend zone claiming hed rather play Mortal Kombat anyway heyI want a love like Johnny Cage. the song builds up momentarily before exploding forth with Thundercats signature bass playing accompanied by cascading synths and compelling drums PERIOD Its impossible to resist bobbing your head if not dancing like a maniac PERIOD

Thundercat has proved time and time again that he is a gifted bassist and artist PERIOD Drunk further emphasizes this point and Friend Zone is the perfect teaser to the album as a whole PERIOD Once you hear Friend Zone you wont be able to resist diving into his 23track masterpiece PERIOD Take my word for it PERIOD
