More than a few people have called the American Civil Liberties Union a passe irrelevant organization PERIOD



They claim that the civil struggles they take on are unimportant and accuse them of siding with criminals lunatics and other undesirables exclusively PERIOD





But aside from the fact that enrollment in the ACLU has dramatically increased since Sept PERIOD  the main case for defending their efforts is their watchfulness of John Ashcroft and the USA Patriots Act PERIOD Dont get me wrong I sometimes wonder what the ACLU is thinking when they pick their battles PERIOD But there can be no higher calling for a civil rights organization than the defense of liberty PERIOD





For those of you who are unfamiliar with the act it was adopted in an effort to combat terrorism PERIOD It calls for expanded law enforcement powers to  the American people particularly immigrants legal or otherwise PERIOD





Thanks to the act the feds have increased access to your personal life PERIOD





They can read emails listen into your phone calls do  searches without informing you track your Internet use or even find out what library books or DVDs youve been renting from Blockbuster PERIOD Theres precious little room for privacy in John Ashcrofts America PERIOD





For those of you who dont know John Ashcroft hes the guy who lost his seat in Congress to a dead guy PERIOD





After the ACLUs initial attack on the USA Patriots Act they also focused their efforts on a grassroots campaign to stop a second Patriot Act from being adopted PERIOD And they werent the only ones PERIOD





Even a few Bushbacking Republicans have said that Ashcroft goes too far PERIOD Also about  local governments across the country have filed their official protests of the USA Patriots Act PERIOD





Thanks to the initial watchfulness of the ACLU and other freedomloving Americans Ashcroft and company may not be able to pass an  on the original Patriots Act which was passed in the days after Sept PERIOD  without even being read by many congresspeople PERIOD





A  which would have expanded the powers of the original act to include every American was in the works but it now appears that it will never get off the ground PERIOD In fact Ashcroft now appears to be fighting to hold on to the original one PERIOD





Hes launched a media blitz and speech tour in an effort to shore up support for the embattled piece of legislature PERIOD This wouldnt have been necessary without the efforts of the ACLU and other watchdogs PERIOD





Hes touring states like Iowa Pennsylvania Ohio and Michigan PERIOD If this pattern sounds familiar its because Bush will be touring them soon to create momentum for his reselection effort PERIOD In these key states hes been making some strange claims PERIOD





For one thing the attorney general credits the Patriot Act as having prevented another Sept PERIOD  style attack PERIOD



Well Ive got some leftovers in the back of my fridge that have probably been there since Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Maybe its them that have prevented another attack PERIOD That makes about as much sense as Ashcrofts specious reasoning PERIOD



What stuns me is that the act is largely supported by conservatives PERIOD How does a desire for smaller government jibe with the concept of an omnipresent police state with every right to poke and prod your private life





Ashcroft doesnt want smaller government PERIOD He wants a bigger one PERIOD





He wants one where hes free to look in on anyone he disapproves of whether theyre suspected of being brownskinned or guilty of trying to buy a plastic hookah from a Web site PERIOD He goes after both with equal gusto PERIOD





Now you may read this and justifiably say  I guess it all depends on how much you trust your government PERIOD If you dont mind them checking up on you without you knowing from time to time then you shouldnt worry PERIOD



But like a holocaust survivor once said they came for one group and I said nothing they came for another group and I still said nothing and by the time they came for me no one was left to say anything PERIOD





So if you want this kind of nation then give Ashcroft your support by all means PERIOD





And if you want a country where people mysteriously disappear to be tried by military tribunals then keep quiet and support the status quo PERIOD





You can even support George Dubya if you want to PERIOD Maybe hes giving you that tax cut youve been itching for but remember that a vote for Bush is also a vote for Ashcroft PERIOD
