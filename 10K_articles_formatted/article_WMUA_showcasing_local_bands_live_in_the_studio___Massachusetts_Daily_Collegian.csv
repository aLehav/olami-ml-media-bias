University of Massachusetts students Declan Murphy and Randy Kovac had an idea but a bit of a problem PERIOD With their radio show on the campus station WMUA . fM the pair wanted to showcase local music PERIOD The exposure would be invited by the band and would offer area listeners to see what the local scene could produce  a break from the daily grind of the Backstreet Boys and Third Eye Blinds of the world PERIOD 
The problem The duo didnt really have a lot of local music to showcase PERIOD The solution 
I just sat down one night and emailed  or  bands said Murphy noting he got the addresses from Internet searches among other places PERIOD The next night Randy did the same thing PERIOD I just sent out a note saying that we have a radio show and were looking for local music to play and asked if they could send us any PERIOD The response was overwhelming. it wasnt too long before Murphy  who goes by D PERIOD Murph on the air  and Kovac  Tha Mad Samoan  started getting CDs in the mail from all over New England PERIOD And more CDs and more CDs and more CDs PERIOD The radio show The Rejected Jedis had music PERIOD 
Massachusetts bands like Junction  and Garrison both of which will be featured at Boston rock staple WBCNs Battle of the Bands in May have responded to the students plea PERIOD UMass or Pioneer Valleybased bands like Traveling Matt Joint Custody  West and Sgt PERIOD Scagnetti also get regular turns on the airwaves PERIOD 
The Rejected Jedis werent rejected at all fortunately.We got  or  CDs said Murphy PERIOD It gives bands a way to get their music out there PERIOD Weve played just about every band that weve gotten stuff from. added Kovac We listen to the CDs they send us and we figure out which songs are the best for airplay PERIOD Weve played a song from every CD thats come in. of the bands a local listener might discover on the show will be groups that will be lending their talent to Southwest Residential Area Battle of the Bands PERIOD For one  West can be seen live at the Skybox on April  in addition to the aforementioned Battle PERIOD 
Yesterday the Amherst band Fire Engine Red granted The Rejected Jedis a live performance which aired from  p.m PERIOD to  a.m PERIOD  the shows weekly allotted time at WMUA PERIOD 
Its the first time weve been able to bring a band into the studio to play because we didnt have the wiring and engineering worked out previously said Murphy PERIOD But we have had other offers. perhaps if the Fire Engine Red performance goes off without too much of a hitch the Jedis will bring on future local bands for live performances PERIOD 
In the meantime Kovac and Murphy will do a bit of scouting work on their own keeping an eye on events like the Battle of the Bands to get new ideas and new music to play PERIOD
