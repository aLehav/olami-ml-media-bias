A chemistry professor at App State developed a new green energy angle that has taken his work to Nature Chemistry a highly rated chemistry journal PERIOD

During Christian Wallens postdoctoral research at University of WisconsinMadison Wallen spent over three years exploring the possibility of combining ammonia and oxygen without additional energy making nitrogen and water which produces energy PERIOD

While at UWMadison Wallen worked closely with his postdoctoral research advisor John Berry and graduate student Michael Trenerry PERIOD They were not the first to come up with the idea of using this tactic to create energy but the first to discover it was possible PERIOD

When it came time for him to look for a postdoc advisor he asked me if I would be willing to take him on as a postdoc Berry said PERIOD I didnt really have to think about it because he is really fantastic and I knew he was really fantastic. part of the paper discusses the concept of using nitrogenbased fuels in what is called the nitrogen economy Wallen said PERIOD The U.S PERIOD currently has a carbon economy meaning that most energy is centered around carbonbased fuel PERIOD

The other part of the article is not solving exactly how the nitrogen energy will be made and used but taking a big step toward making nitrogenbased energy and discovering how it is possible Wallen said PERIOD

After his research was finished he applied and received the position as an assistant chemistry professor at App State PERIOD Wallen teaches an inorganic chemistry lab introduction to chemistry II and its accompanying lab class PERIOD

What I want my students to see is that even though we dont have milliondollar instruments it doesnt matter PERIOD Because when we need to do something we cant do theres other scientists in the field that also care about the same problem we do and there is a community we can use Wallen said PERIOD

Wallen along with his wife Rebecca Wallen who also teaches at the university in the App States English Language Studies institute moved to the area in summer of  PERIOD

Just being there with him to encourage him during the discouraging times because science is full of discouraging times even getting to celebrate with him too is neat Rebecca Wallen said PERIOD I would just say that our marriage and our relationship is a strong foundation for working together and supporting each other. after publishing the article in Nature Chemistry Christian Wallen and Berry said people were crawling out of the woodwork to talk with them about the research PERIOD They have obtained a patent for their idea putting legal rights to their research under each persons name PERIOD

No other paper I have published has there been this kind of response Berry said PERIOD The interest in this is really quite strong PERIOD I think its just the right research topic at the right time I think everyone is really concerned about what do we do about dying down fossil fuels. christian Wallen and his team are hoping to have a fuel cell to test by the end of the spring semester PERIOD In order to put their research to work on a global scale they will need a commercial partner Berry said PERIOD

At the end of the day what we really need is not just more money and more chemicals and more grants Christian Wallen said PERIOD What we really need is more creative thinking and that is something we can supply regardless of what institution we are at. ellen Cowan professor in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences boarded a scientific drill ship called the JOIDES Resolution to res..
