Spending quality time with my friends from abroad generally involves conversations about the trivial subjects that everyone discusses PERIOD Relationships weekend plans and reminders to repay bar tabs are among the usual highlights but recently politics had entered the fray PERIOD



However rather than discussions about PM Singhs revitalization of Indias economy or the new property rights in United Arab Emirates the U.S PERIOD presidential race was a dominant topic PERIOD



I suppose that this shouldnt come as a surprise especially with the bombardment of campaign advertisements and news coverage on American television PERIOD Whats amazing is the global speculation that it received PERIOD As other countries have always had some degree of awareness about our national politics never before has the interest from abroad been quite like  PERIOD



From Russias Putin praising President Bush reelection to the hated Bin Laden referencing  citizens of other countries were also on edge PERIOD I was impressed by how much my old roommate who now works in China knew about the current situation in the States PERIOD He received ample information detailing poll numbers and recent statistics that many try to ignore PERIOD



Conversely how many Americans honestly know who the prime minister of Japan is Unless your major is international studies or youre into political anime flicks youve probably never given much thought to politics on the land of the rising sun PERIOD



On the other hand some foreign media outlets go out of their way to make their enthusiasts aware of U.S PERIOD politics PERIOD One global information agency took a poll of the residents of other countries as if they could vote for the U.S PERIOD president PERIOD Most chose Sen PERIOD Kerry but the prevalent issue on their minds was the war in Iraq not comprehensive of any domestic concerns PERIOD



The Guardian a liberal publication from Great Britain encouraged readers to write to swing voters in Ohio urging them to oust President Bush PERIOD This obviously peeved some Ohio residents who wanted foreigners to mind their own business PERIOD



But not all Americans want to ignore international opinion when making the decision to vote PERIOD President Bush makes it a point to remind everyone that the Polish leadership has him in their best interests PERIOD Senator Kerry mentioned anonymous world leaders who had supposedly told him that they are hoping for his victory PERIOD



Since the world is becoming closer together economically and culturally its expected that the careful selection of the most powerful person on Earth would generate such a large international curiosity PERIOD There are numerous corporations and political powers that have much to gain or lose depending on who takes over the executive branch of the United States PERIOD There was a proKerry march including educators and schoolchildren in Islamabad Pakistan while a little farther west an Iranian official proclaimed that he wanted President Bush to remain in office PERIOD Who would imagine  coming from such places



Another reason that foreigners were glued to U.S PERIOD election coverage is leisure related PERIOD For those of our generation who have grown up watching  listening to the Notorious B.I.G PERIOD and eating at KFC all from the comfort of foreign nations there is much interest in the land that these popculture icons come from PERIOD



While the war in Iraq has angered masses of foreign Generation Xers the vast majority of them are confused PERIOD The question of why the country of milk shakes drivein theaters and unlimited freedom chose to destroy a country that did not seem to be much of a threat to most of the world Why did the United States the utopia that many nations could only hope to emulate flex its muscles and make an example out of a pathetic enemy Why has the land of opportunity free education secular cooperation and peaceful citizens sacrificed worldwide respect



But like domestic media the news from beyond our borders is also guilty of bias PERIOD Outsiders didnt have to put up with the barrage of campaign advertisements and brutal personal attacks that Americans had the privilege of receiving PERIOD Forget that they arent citizens they are not qualified to vote because they cant make an educated choice due to lack of exposure to good oldfashioned allAmerican mudslinging PERIOD



On behalf of those who were ineligible but still largely interested in this election I hope that the citizens got out there filled out that ballot and most importantly showed an international student who is boss by shoving a  sticker and complementary lollipop in his face PERIOD
