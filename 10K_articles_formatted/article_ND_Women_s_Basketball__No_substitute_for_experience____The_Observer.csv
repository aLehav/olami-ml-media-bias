Laura Myers  Thursday November  

After Notre Dame fell  to Minnesota in a shocking first round playoff game in March  players left the Joyce Center stunned and disappointed PERIOD

They will enter a different arena but the  players are the same and theyre ready to forget the ugly end to the  season PERIOD

Its a new season I think were starting fresh coach Muffet McGraw said PERIOD We have great leadership and good energy. the No PERIOD  Irish did not lose a single player to graduation after last season and now return a squad of seasoned upperclassman PERIOD

The experience level is something that is so nice to have come tournament time senior captain Melissa Lechlitner said PERIOD Weve been there everyone has been through it PERIOD So many people can help the freshmen through things PERIOD Weve all been there done that. lechlitner and fellow senior captains Ashley Barlow and Erica Williamson bring even more experience to the table  all three were captains in their junior year PERIOD The team elected the three to helm the squad again for the  season PERIOD

I think we have great leadership McGraw said PERIOD I think theyre doing a remarkable job PERIOD I think theyre working well together and I think they complement each other really well PERIOD They have different strengths and theyre each doing what they do well. barlow said the consistency in leadership helps the captains and the team PERIOD

We know how they react to what we say and what were doing she said PERIOD Its easier for us to be able to lead by example lead them by showing them and by what we say. while the team is dominated by upperclassmen the younger players will not be cast aside McGraw said PERIOD In fact in Tuesdays  exhibition win over Indianapolis the top three scorers were underclassmen who came off of the bench PERIOD Freshman forward Skylar Diggins and sophomore guard Erica Solomon each scored  points and sophomore guard Natalie Novosel added  PERIOD

Were expecting everybody to contribute McGraw said PERIOD We dont look at it as seniors have to do this many things and freshman have to do this PERIOD Its going to be a team effort and different people will have to step up on different nights and play well. i think everybody wants to win PERIOD I dont think anybody cares whos hot on a particular night theyll just try to get them the ball. while the offense drew attention in the win the captains said the team spends a lot of time in practice working on defense PERIOD

Weve picked up the intensity a lot on the defensive end and I think that was the main focus in preseason as well Barlow said PERIOD The defensive intensity has picked up dramatically. after all the team does not want to see a repeat of last year when they once again host the first two rounds of NCAA regional play in March  PERIOD Though the team is just beginning a long season Notre Dame has the playoffs in the back of its mind PERIOD

We want to be playing our best basketball in March McGraw said PERIOD We feel like weve got a lot to accomplish. lechlitner said the team is able to prove itself and to reach those accomplishments PERIOD

Our first goal is just to play to our potential she said PERIOD Weve got a lot of talented players on our team and a lot of good things can happen PERIOD If we have the right chemistry and everyone does what she needs to do our teams success is really just going to skyrocket from there. share This Story

Notre Dame will play in its final exhibition game of the season when its.. PERIOD
