Most of us at Northeastern are in our twenties yet we are still fascinatedwith Halloween  but for all the wrong reasons PERIOD Its not that dressing up as firefighters cowboys Indians and superheroes is obsolete PERIOD Its just now these supposed costumes come with a disclaimer you must be an adult version once you hit a certain age PERIOD And that doesnt mean more mature like you would assume or that youre aspiring to be one of these things in your everyday life PERIOD It simply means that your costume consists of less than  inches of material  and you probably paid  for it at Dorothys Boutique PERIOD

Stop wasting money and dignity PERIOD A sense of humor is just as sexy as a halfnaked nurse and nowhere near as expensive or trashy PERIOD This Halloween I would encourage those looking for Halloween inspiration to turn away from the strip club and look instead to the ridiculousness of pop culture and a thrift store PERIOD Especially you freshmen PERIOD If youre really the most competitive class to enter this school like weve been reminded on a daily basis grace us upperclassmen with your innovation and get creative PERIOD

Because I know most of our dedicated students are too busy studying and drinking to plan a Halloween costume further in advance then the day of here are some helpful costume suggestions Ive thought of to ensure you wont be confused for a streetwalker come this years All Hallows Eve PERIOD

The NBA lockout Don a basketball jersey and wrap yourself in chains PERIOD This is witty cheap and easy PERIOD Comfort is debatable but its got to be better than rocking sixinchheels all night long PERIOD

Rebecca Black The girl everyone loves to hate PERIOD Take a white TShirt and write Its Friday Friday Friday with magic marker PERIOD There will be no mistaking who you are especially if you belt out tunes and proclaim youre having fun fun fun fun. if youre getting a ride to your destination on Halloween be sure to contemplate long and hard about which seat in the
car to take PERIOD

Princess Beatrice of York Also known as the woman who wore that absurd bow hat at the Royal Wedding PERIOD Use cardboard to create a large circle and mockbow and paint it beige PERIOD Or go as sisterofthemoment Pippa Middleton PERIOD All you need is a conservative dress a silly hat butt pads for that coveted booty and someone to pose as your sexy Euroboy toy PERIOD

The Nyan Cat One of Youtubes most popular cat sensations PERIOD Paint your face and put on some cat ears PERIOD Wear a pink polkadotted Tshirt with a rainbow flag attached to your back PERIOD Instead of walking I highly suggest running from party to party to guarantee the fulleffect PERIOD

Dress as a song Last year two of my friends were Deadmau5s Ghosts  Stuff. one of them dressed as a ghost nothing more than a sheet with two eye cutouts and the other one was stuff. she wore a plain dress and glued random items yoyos cards bottle caps etc. to it PERIOD Try Party in the USA by Miley Cyrus VideoPhone by Lady GaGa  Beyonce or Creep by Radiohead PERIOD

Occupy Boston If you participated in the rally you dont have to do anything except bring your I am the  sign PERIOD But you cant be a protest alone PERIOD Get your friends to make signs and tshirts and travel in a pack PERIOD For bonus creativity points dont shower for the week leading up to Halloween PERIOD
Feel free to wear your oldest rattiest clothes and eat granola PERIOD

Anthony Weiner Enough said PERIOD

If all else fails and you feel like buying a costume is absolutely necessary I would only ask one thing dont ever stoop as low as the Anna Rexia costume on www.supermodelboutique.com PERIOD It comes complete with a skeleton dress tape measure and boneshaped hairbow PERIOD Next years musthave costume Boo Limia PERIOD
