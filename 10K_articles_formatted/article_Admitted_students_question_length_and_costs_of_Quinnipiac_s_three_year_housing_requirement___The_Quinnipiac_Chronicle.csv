While some Quinnipiac University admitted students think the new threeyear housing requirement is beneficial they are not sure if three years will be too long and if the expenses will add to their financial burden PERIOD

Quinnipiac will require all incoming students beginning in the fall  semester to live on campus for at least six academic semesters according to its 10year master facilities plan PERIOD

The reason for the mandate is to provide students with the full residential experience and maximize their personal and professional development PERIOD

Annie Patwell of East Greenbush New York who was admitted to the athletic training and physical therapy programs said she agrees with the requirement PERIOD

It helps me lean more toward QU because I know I have guaranteed housing Patwell said PERIOD It will just be easier to be on a campus since I probably will not have a car. melissa Robles of Brooklyn New York who already committed to the university said she did not know about the new requirement before but she thought it might be the right move considering COVID19 and other safety reasons PERIOD

It was definitely shocking but I loved QU so much that this requirement didnt affect my decision Robles said PERIOD All the pros to this school outweighed this rule. living on campus is an important aspect of college life for high schoolers Robles said PERIOD However she thought three years might be too long PERIOD

As cheesy as it might sound living in a dorm its a onceinalifetime experience Robles said PERIOD Its all about the experience but after freshman year you lived that experience and should be able to have the choice of where you want to live. alex Robinson of New York City was admitted to the psychology program PERIOD She said she is in favor of the requirement but not with the threeyear length PERIOD

I personally like the requirement because I want to work in CT and it feels like a good option but I would have preferred it to maybe be a twoyear commitment not three Robinson said PERIOD In junior year most of us will be  if not older. robinson could not say for sure whether she wants to live on campus for three years as she does not know a lot of information about the dorms PERIOD She also thinks living off campus during the last two years of college is important to start her life journey as an adult PERIOD

For admitted students from Connecticut like Cailyn Zanesky of Trumbull the requirement drove them away from committing to Quinnipiac PERIOD Zanesky is also considering going to Mitchell College in New London PERIOD

I dont agree with the oncampus required housing Zanesky said PERIOD I was about to make the deposit until I saw that housing was required and that set me back. quinnipiac made an exception to this requirement for students who live within a 25mile drive of campus at their permanent legal residence PERIOD

Zanesky said she is not ready to live on campus yet PERIOD

I think living at home would allow me to be able to perform better Zanesky said PERIOD On top of this I dont feel comfortable living on campus as were going through a global pandemic. financial burden was also a concern among students PERIOD Some said it is expensive considering the lifestyle they will be living which they said it is not even the nicest PERIOD

I wish I had the option to not pay as much for the dorms in the last two years considering its required and I could probably find something cheaper outside of campus Robinson said PERIOD

Students also said that housing is not the only expense students have to think about since there are other costs like their student loan debts PERIOD

Yes if living off campus is less expensive then why wouldnt that be a choice when so many of us are in college debt Robles said PERIOD Its definitely very concerning. according to Quinnipiacs website room and board fees for incoming firstyear students is  per year PERIOD
