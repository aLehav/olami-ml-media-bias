Students who think Kerrytown is too far of a walk to buy fresh produce will have to travel no further than the Michigan Union PERIOD

In the courtyard of the Michigan Union yesterday the Michigan Student Assembly hosted its first MFarmers Market which offered local produce and plants for purchase as well as live demonstrations and instructions for food preparation PERIOD MSAs new initiative which many other University divisions also contributed to raise awareness about locally grown food PERIOD

LSA senior Monica Sangal the MSA Health Issues Commission chair said she came up with the idea for an oncampus farmers market because she wants fresh produce to be available for students PERIOD

We really wanted to promote healthy eating on campus Sangal said PERIOD Normally the Farmers Market in Kerrytown is a little too far away for getting food. sangal teamed up with Keith Soster the food service director at the Michigan Union to brainstorm the idea for the market PERIOD A variety of campus divisions collaborated on the project including representatives from MHealthy University Housing the Student Sustainability Initiative Planet Blue University Catering University Arts and Programs University Health Services and the Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute PERIOD

Soster said he hopes the farmers market will educate the University community about what the broader Ann Arbor community has to offer PERIOD

That is ultimately our goal  to educate the community as to what is available out there Soster said PERIOD This is a great time of the year because harvest time is approaching so well have lots of great varieties. mSA also approached the University Unions with the project because the assembly had heard from students who were interested in having more local and fresh items available on campus said Laura Seagram marketing communications specialist for the University Unions PERIOD

The University already stocks locally grown products in University dining halls and retail locations such as Beansters Caf University Club Caf and Ugos PERIOD However Seagram said she believes the farmers market will be an opportunity for students to get to know more about local produce PERIOD

This is a handy way to have the farmers get a little bit more exposure and have direct contact with the students Seagram said PERIOD

At yesterdays market two chefs from Residential Dining Services and the Michigan Union led a cooking demonstration focused on healthy eating and preparing easy affordable meals that students can make at home PERIOD

Tina Todosciuk  a farmer from Howell Mich PERIOD had a table at the market and sold sweet corn melon eggplant tomatoes and peppers PERIOD Todosciuk said she hopes the market encourages students to get more interested in locally grown food PERIOD

The great thing about local food is that you know where its coming from you know how its raised she said PERIOD You know what chemicals are in it or not in it and its more nutritional. sangal wrote in an email interview that the MFarmers Market  scheduled next for Oct PERIOD   offered a variety of produce including apples squash plums tomatoes sweet corn eggplant peppers melons and watermelon PERIOD

Law School student Mary Fee said she appreciated the markets selection especially considering it was the first run PERIOD

Its great she said PERIOD Its small but it seems to have as much variety as a farmers market usually does. lSA junior Stacy Kim said she decided to check out the market after receiving an invite to its debut on Facebook PERIOD Kim praised the market calling it cute and adorable. but the market could benefit from a change of location Kim said PERIOD

It was kind of hard to understand where the Union patio was she said PERIOD Maybe if they could have it in a more recognizable location it would be nice. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
