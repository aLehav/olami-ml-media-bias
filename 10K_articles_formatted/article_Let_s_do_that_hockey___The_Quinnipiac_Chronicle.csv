In an email released to the student body Quinnipiac increased the number of tickets for the student section due to high student demand especially with a guaranteed sell out PERIOD

Student tickets normally sell out in around  seconds DeVito said PERIOD Getting tickets for the game in my opinion is harder than registering for classes. the day of the game creates a new atmosphere for the students on campus PERIOD There is a different sort of energy and excitement PERIOD

Last Fridays game was evidence of that nature as students waited outside the Peoples United Center as early as  a.m according to the Quinnipiac mens ice hockey Twitter account PERIOD

As the day continued more people began to show up and line up outside PERIOD Some students skipped their  p.m PERIOD classes to get in line in pure hope of getting a good seat PERIOD

Quinnipiac head coach Rand Pecknold noticed the student bodys dedication to the game and the team PERIOD He headed outside the arena with boxes of pizza and gave it out to the waiting students PERIOD

Out in the bitter cold students formed a line that began to circle the arena PERIOD To keep the fans entertained while the arena was being set up for the game both the pep band and the Teletubbies Quinnipiacs spirit group did everything they could to fire them up PERIOD

Athletics did a great job getting the students more excited than ever DeVito said PERIOD Coach Pecknold bringing out the pizza the band getting everyone rowdy or the Teletubbies hyping up the crowd there were a lot more elements than normal. mediacredit id2199 alignalignright width300mediacreditThe moment the clock struck  p.m. the enthusiastic but bitterly cold fans stormed through ticket entry leading to a mad frenzy to find highquality seating PERIOD

There was a constant buzz amongst the crowd especially the student section leading up to warmups PERIOD The tradition of Quinnipiac students turning on their flashlights when the lights come down is energizing PERIOD

Sgt PERIOD Dan Clark The Singing Trooper galvanized the already exhilarated crowd with his emphatic rendition of the national anthem PERIOD

Quinnipiac brought its A game and it showed from the start as it fired shot after shot on net registering  shots in the first five minutes PERIOD Each shot attempt drew a louder reaction from the crowd PERIOD

Quinnipiacs senior forward Nick Jermain chipped the puck into the back of the net during the first period after a sequence of loose puck attempts in the front of the net PERIOD The crowd was deafening during the celebration PERIOD

The iconic Seven Nation Army chant ensued after Quinnipiacs goal which led to nonstop chants throughout the remainder of the period PERIOD

It was a euphoric wave of Bobcat nation Alec Williams freshman class president and firstyear PA major from Syracuse New York said PERIOD Thats the loudest Ive ever heard the Frank this year. quinnipiac sustained its level of competitiveness in the second period leading to two more goals PERIOD

Absolute domination by Quinnipiac this game enticed the fans to dig in a little more with some random chirps specifically when the game became chippy PERIOD

Im a very verbal fan at the Quinnipiac games I like to throw anything that comes to mind out there and get a laugh or two Will DeBlis a firstyear public relations major from Milburn New Jersey said PERIOD I love when our team throws the body makes the rest of the crowd more animated. the third period was more of the same for Quinnipiac as it added a fourth goal PERIOD The celebration by freshman forward Michael Lombardi right in front of the student section capped off the night for the crowd as Quinnipiac would go on to shutout Yale  PERIOD

This win continued the unbeaten streak at home for Quinnipiac against its rivals since the teams loss to Yale in the national championship in  PERIOD This also gives the team a sense of pride most notably for players such as senior defensemen Chase Priskie and Luke Shiplo PERIOD

Before the game when we were standing in line when they were doing the anthem and stuff I looked over to Priskie and was like hey this is our last go Shiplo said PERIOD We know we have the firefighter hat and we havent lost that since weve been here PERIOD Its just unbelievable playing in the Yale game. the excitement of returning students motivates the newer ones to become part of such an enriched and emotional contest PERIOD
