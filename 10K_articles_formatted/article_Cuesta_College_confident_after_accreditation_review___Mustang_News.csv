Cuesta Colleges long struggle to maintain the community colleges accredited status drew to a close last month during the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges ACCJC visit this October PERIOD

The local community college has been at risk of losing its accredited status since January  when it was placed on a warning status PERIOD In  Cuesta was given a probation status before it was told it would have until this October to show cause as to why Cuesta should maintain an accredited status according to the schools Web page on the accreditation process PERIOD

Members of ACCJC visited the college for two days and spoke with  people to review the schools progress before an exit interview that left Cuesta College administration hopeful interim Cuesta College Vice President for Academic Affairs Deborah Wulff said PERIOD

It was a very positive exit interview Wulff said PERIOD

Cuesta College will find out how positive the visit was in late January or early February of  when ACCJC returns its official report on the community college PERIOD

Cuesta Colleges accreditation renewal with ACCJC was hindered over the past several years by the schools lack of longterm strategic planning Wulff said PERIOD

That problem has now been remedied and Cuesta College is confident in its new strategic plan which was implemented last spring Wulff said PERIOD

We have all the components in place Wulff said PERIOD Its just that we have not gone through a full cycle of planning. cuesta Colleges only weakness during the ACCJC October visit was the fact that the plan has not been in place for a full year yet Wulff said PERIOD Wulff said while the committee was satisfied with the plan and will not revoke the schools accreditation Cuesta College will probably remain on sanctions until the integrated planning has been tested for at least a year PERIOD

We will stay on sanctions and we should be very very happy Wulff said PERIOD Thats a win for us. cuesta Colleges battle to maintain its accredited status began three years ago during a perfect storm of challenges said former Cuesta College lead journalism instructor and current Cal Poly journalism lecturer Patrick Howe PERIOD

While administrators were leaving the school and Cuesta College was working to fill leadership positions the Western Association of Schools and Colleges WASC which runs ACCJC was tightening its standards Howe said PERIOD

Cuesta found themselves in the worst place at the worst time Howe said PERIOD

Cuesta College officials worked to satisfy ACCJC concerns before the commissions visit last year but failed to meet all of the criteria Howe said PERIOD Among these criteria was the need to complete the integrated planning PERIOD

Though Cuesta College was making progress it was placed on the Show Cause status and given a last chance to save its accredited status PERIOD

A lot of people were just pulling out their hair Howe said PERIOD

Howe is confident however that Cuesta has proven itself this time around PERIOD

If I had to look at my crystal ball I think theyre going to be fine Howe said PERIOD

At Cuesta students arent too worried about the accreditation either student Nate Holben said PERIOD

For Holben getting the right classes and dealing with budget cuts are more important than visiting accreditation committees he said PERIOD

I just feel that time could be spent a lot more effectively Holben said PERIOD

Cuesta College had to create a contingency plan in case the school closed when it was placed on the Show Cause status but Holben doesnt think the plan will be necessary PERIOD The chances that the community college actually closes its doors are slim Holben said PERIOD

We have a hard time buying that theyre actually going to do it Holben said PERIOD Youre just going to put yourselves and however many students out in the cold
