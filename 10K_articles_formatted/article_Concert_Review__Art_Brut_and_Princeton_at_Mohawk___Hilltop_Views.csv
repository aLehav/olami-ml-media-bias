Londons Art Brut brought their blend of punklike energy and lead singer Eddie Argos witty lyrics about modern art and English life to the Mohawk with outstanding results PERIOD

After a great opening set on Oct PERIOD  from the Los Angeles group Princeton the crowds excitement grew as Art Brut was set to take the stage PERIOD

The band has developed a loyal fan base and there was a healthy amount of them present at the show PERIOD

Argos who talks into the microphone more than he sings was celebrating his birthday and started things off by admitting to the crowd that he was a little drunk PERIOD

The band then proceeded to play Formed a Band their calling card off their debut album Bang Bang Rock  Roll. the band also played many cuts from 2007s Its A Bit Complicated and this years Art Brut vs PERIOD Satan. the recurring motif in the majority of the songs was Argos adding on to his already hilarious lyrics PERIOD For example on Formed A Band after stating that Were going to be the band that writes the song that makes Israel and Palestine get along he added and then America and Scotland easy peasy. moments like these occurred throughout their set and didnt fail to bring a smile to concert goers faces PERIOD

While Argos worked his magic on the microphone the other four members of Art Brut played with a contagious amount of energy PERIOD Most of their songs are fast and filled with instrumental hooks and each member played as though being chased by a train PERIOD

Guitarists Ian Catskilkin and Jasper Future played their instruments with a sort of cheeky swagger and bassist Frederica Feedback and drummer Mikey Breyer who played his kit standing up provided a strong rhythm section that pulled everything together PERIOD

Art Brut has a way of connecting with their audience that makes them feel like they are a part of something and the sheer manic energy that can be found their records is only magnified when they play to a crowd PERIOD They are a truly one of a kind act and they ably proved that with their Mohawk performance PERIOD
