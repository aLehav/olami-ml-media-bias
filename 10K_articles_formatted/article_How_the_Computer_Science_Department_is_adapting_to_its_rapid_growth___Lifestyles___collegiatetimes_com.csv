Exterior view of McBryde Hall April   PERIOD

Undergraduate computer science programs have been growing at impressive rates at many colleges since the turn of the century PERIOD With the rapid advancement of technology in recent years its no surprise that the number of bachelors degrees awarded by undergraduate computer science programs in the United States and Canada rose by74 between  and  PERIOD Virginia Techs computer science department is no exception to this rule PERIOD

Seven or eight years ago we were probably graduating  to  bachelors students per year PERIOD This year we graduated about  said Cal Ribbens head of the Department of Computer Science PERIOD

This rapid growth has provided many opportunities for the department but it has also presented several pitfalls PERIOD The rapidly increasing class sizes have created novel problems for both students and staff PERIOD

Its pushing  students each semester for these courses Im working on said Margaret Ellis an associate professor of practice in Virginia Techs computer science program PERIOD

Professor Ellis oversees organizing Introduction to Problem Solving in Computer Science and Software Design and Data Structures two integral computer science classes for sophomores in the department PERIOD The growing size of these classes can make it harder for students to get help from professors in these formative classes PERIOD

Teaching assistants have become increasingly popular resources for students because of the scale of classes PERIOD Both graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants are hired each semester to help with organizing assignments grading and directly answering student questions PERIOD However a flurry of questions can become too much for even the teaching assistants at points PERIOD

However this faculty growth has caused some issues for the department in recent years PERIOD The Computer Science Department has grown out of its original home in McBryde Hall and has had to relocate about half of its staff and graduate students to the Corporate Research Center CRC off campus PERIOD This split has made some professors office hours notoriously hard to access for oncampus students and has even caused some logistics issues within the faculty PERIOD

While the rapid growth of the department has been a challenge it has worked hard to adapt PERIOD Instead of introducing a cap or something along those lines the department has instead embraced this challenge and taken the opportunity to grow and serve more students and faculty PERIOD

This program seems to be successful in drawing new qualified candidates PERIOD The number of staff continues to grow to accommodate more classes PERIOD

We hope to be hiring five to  professors per year for the next six years Ribbens said PERIOD

Although the department has had to change how it operates a bit to account for this growth it has also brought some positives PERIOD The newfound scale of the Computer Science Department has provided it with some unique advantages PERIOD

Good things come from scale too PERIOD We can offer all kinds of classes employers love us and come here to the career fairs like crazy and we hire some amazing faculty who do really cool things Ribbens said PERIOD

As the department has grown it has also become more diverse PERIOD

The percentage of women in Virginia Techs Computer Science Department has risen from  to  since  Ellis said PERIOD

The department has plans to make some major changes moving forward to further accommodate its growth PERIOD These plans are a series of expansions including new buildings as well as finding new room in existing buildings on campus PERIOD

The first major expansion the department is undertaking is its move to Torgersen Hall PERIOD

Torgerson will house a new undergraduate learning center a tutoring center and offices and research labs for approximately  tenuretrack faculty and at least  instructional faculty Ribbens said on a website detailing the expansion plans PERIOD This website is not public yet as some details are still being finalized PERIOD

Having a more central space on campus will help instill a more uniform sense of community within the Computer Science Department as well PERIOD The size of the department as well as the split between the CRC and McBryde made this almost impossible to achieve in the past PERIOD

I think students will have a better sense of community and more access to other students resources and faculty because they will know where to find us Ellis said PERIOD

The next building that the department intends to expand into is a new construction on Gilbert Street PERIOD The final building that the department will expand into has been dubbed the Data and Decision Science building PERIOD

Overall the growth of the department has been both exciting and challenging for students and faculty PERIOD While some might falter in the face of this challenge students and staff alike keep a positive mindset moving forward PERIOD

The department embraces these new minds and with its newfound resources hopes to craft a new generation of talented engineers PERIOD If anything this scale issue is just another interesting problem for this department of engineers to solve in their unique style PERIOD
