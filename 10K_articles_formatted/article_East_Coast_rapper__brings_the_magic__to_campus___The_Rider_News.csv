Rider has many traditions Midnight Breakfast Eggscellent Egg Hunt Cranberry Fest and more PERIOD While all these traditions made a return after COVID19 pandemic restrictions were lifted one tradition that has yet to make its way back is the Student Entertainment Council SEC Concert PERIOD

The tradition invites a musical celebrity to perform in a Rider studentexclusive concert and has been a student favorite since its inception PERIOD The last time a concert took place was in September  when artist A Boogie wit da Hoodie performed PERIOD When the pandemic swept the world big music events all over the world were kept from taking place including at the university PERIOD Even when it was deemed safe for schools to reopen the event did not return PERIOD

Many students who had been attending Rider when the pandemic hit reminisced about the concerts telling their younger friends and fellow peers about the A Boogie wit da Hoodie concert PERIOD

However the  concert will soon just be another good memory PERIOD March  sees the return of the SEC Concert with Nardo Wick and special guest Gloss Up PERIOD

Students like Lianne Litchfield a sophomore film and television major had heard about the experience from her friends and peers that had been at Rider prepandemic PERIOD

I know theyve talked about these experiences a lot PERIOD Now Im finally gonna get to experience that myself and thats pretty fun said Litchfield PERIOD

Wick is famous for songs such as Who Want Smoke and Me or Sum which features rappers Future and Lil Baby PERIOD The rapper has been featured on  Duggs song Opp Pack and on rapper Katana 10400s She Want Me Dead For lovers of East Coast rap Wick is a welcomed surprise and for all of Rider students the concert is one of the missing puzzle pieces in their university experience PERIOD

Nick Barbati associate dean of campus life works with SEC and was excited to help bring the event back to campus PERIOD

I think the concert was important PERIOD One of the things that since COVID weve been hearing constantly is When is the Student Entertainment Council going to bring back the concert And it has been a wonderful tradition over the years said Barbati PERIOD Rider has had some really wonderful artists PERIOD I think at this point the timing felt safe and it felt right to allow students to celebrate with a largescale concert that theyve been asking for. junior dance major Marissa Stellato expressed her happiness that the concert would bring a new feeling of life to campus PERIOD

We havent really had a big event yet this semester PERIOD I think its something everyone will enjoy said Stellato PERIOD

Members of the Rider community were notified about the event on March  and excited students rushed to sign up for their tickets PERIOD The concert is exclusively for Rider students who must wear wrist bands distributed on the day of the concert in the Student Recreation Center SRC from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD On March  the Rider community was informed that Wick would have a special guest Gloss Up PERIOD Gloss Up is originally from Tennessee and like Wick appeared on the rap scene just a few years ago PERIOD

As March  approaches anticipation fills the air as excited students ask their friends if they got their tickets yet PERIOD Rider is alive with tradition and the community is ready for it PERIOD",East Coast rapper ‘brings the magic’ to campus – The Rider News,Rider University
