Senior Otaro Alaka has played a piviotal role in the Aggies rushing defense which allows only . yards per game PERIOD

The Texas AM football team is coming home after three consecutive SEC road games where the Aggies went  against South Carolina Mississippi State and Auburn PERIOD

Now the Aggies set their sights on Ole Miss as the  Rebels come to Kyle Field on Saturday for an SEC West showdown PERIOD Though Ole Miss has also lost two straight games the Rebel offense presents serious challenges for the AM defense PERIOD

In last weeks  loss to South Carolina Rebel quarterback Jordan Taamu pushed his season passing yard total past  putting him at fourth in the nation PERIOD Taamus  passing yards put him at fourth in the nation PERIOD

The AM defense has proven it can stop the run but its still far from proving it can stop the pass PERIOD The Aggies have the nations secondbest run defense but the 83rdranked pass defense PERIOD A matchup with a quarterback like Taamu is the last thing the AM defense wanted to see PERIOD

With their quarterback and the good receivers they have its going to be a good challenge junior linebacker Tyrel Dodson said PERIOD We need to go out there and say no ones going to catch the ball no ones going to run on us PERIOD Its just about having a mindset and going about your business. taamu is a dominant quarterback but his performance is strongly dependent on his group of receivers PERIOD Junior AJ Brown sophomore DK Metcalf and senior DaMarkus Lodge are top five in the SEC for receiving yards PERIOD Brown has hauled in  receptions for  yards and five touchdowns PERIOD His  yards put him sixth in the nation in that category PERIOD Lodge has caught  passes for  yards and two touchdowns and Metcalf has caught  passes for  yards and five touchdowns PERIOD

Their receivers can all hit home runs AM head coach Jimbo Fisher said PERIOD Their back is a very good back PERIOD Their quarterback is athletic he can run and can make throws PERIOD .. PERIOD Youre on pins and needles every play because whoever touches it can make a play. the AM front seven is led by senior Kingsley Keke who has  tackles . for loss and six sacks on the year PERIOD The duo of Otaro Alaka and Dodson in the linebacker corps has been lethal all year as well PERIOD Alaka leads the team with  tackles and . tackles for loss PERIOD Dodson is third on the team with  tackles including three tackles for loss PERIOD The secondary is led by senior safety Donovan Wilson who is second on the team in tackles with  and leads the team with one interception PERIOD

Its a very very tough place to play Ole Miss head coach Matt Luke said PERIOD Theyre very physical on defense and very tough to run against but well have to find a way to get the run game going where its not all on Taamu and the receivers. running back Scottie Phillips sits behind Williams on the SEC rushing list with  yards on the season and  rushing touchdowns PERIOD The AM front seven has shut down every running back the Aggies have faced this year including Clemsons Travis Etienne and Kentuckys Benny Snell and its unlikely that Phillips will be immune PERIOD

AM will host Ole Miss on Nov PERIOD  looking to earn its tenth straight bowl appearance PERIOD Kickoff is set for  a.m PERIOD and the game will be televised on CBS PERIOD
