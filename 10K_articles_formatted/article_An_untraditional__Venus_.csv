Theres no simple way to describe Venus a play put on by The Rude Mechanicals premiering this weekend at the Mendelssohn Theatre PERIOD

Theres the story of a South African woman taken from her country and brought into Europe for the sole purpose of exploitation PERIOD Theres the notion that what is termed exoticism is often a euphemism for aberration. and theres the recognition that certain cruelties from the past are not so far removed from the present PERIOD

Venus is Pulitzer Prizewinning playwright Suzie Lorie Parkss dramatic interpretation of the life of South African woman Saartjie Baartman PERIOD  During the nineteenth century Baartman was showcased around Europe as a purported freak show and ultimately dissected because of the publics fascination with her large rear end PERIOD  Baartmans story would be laughable if it was simply a creation of the playwrights wit and not a verifiable part of history PERIOD

The Rude Mechanicals a studentrun theater group for nonTheater School students chose the rather obscure Venus as its winter production because of its unconventional subject matter said producer and Engineering senior Lauren Michniacki PERIOD

Were for people who do theater because they love it Michniacki said PERIOD The majority of us arent theater majors. lSA sophomore Queencilia Onyebuchi who plays the title role of Hottentot Venus prepared to taking on such a daunting character by researching Baartmans doomed existence PERIOD

Her life was actually a tragedy Onyebuchi said PERIOD I dont think enough light is shed upon her as a person in history. lSA senior and director Hyatt Michaels aided the plays unconventional topic with an avantgarde stage aesthetic and offbeat costumes and makeup PERIOD The actors dressed solely in black red and white have painted faces to resemble mimes an idea Michaels drew from the Surrealist movement PERIOD The stage also primarily black with slight splashes of white and red was conceived with a desire for discreetness PERIOD

I wanted people to focus on Venus Michaels said PERIOD I concentrated on just a few colors because I wanted the attention to be on the story and not things like the costumes. the story of the Hottentot Venus  Venus referring to the Greek goddess admired for her unrivaled beauty and Hottentot being the name of a group of South African peoples  is an example of blatant inhumanity PERIOD The play is uncomfortable at times because it addresses this inhumanity something that Michaels wanted to stress PERIOD

I took a lot of inspiration from the Dada movement Michaels said referring to the early twentieth century cultural movement that was characterized by its use of art as protest PERIOD

If the notion of Baartmans backside being poked and prodded in the name of science doesnt push buttons Michaelss song selection might just speed the process along PERIOD  Although the plays topics are generally unnerving giddy 70s tunes such as The Hustle make their way into some of the scenes PERIOD

I used a lot of funk and disco Michaels said PERIOD Such playful sounds going along with darker elements of the play pushes buttons by the use of clashing elements. rC senior Luke Randall who plays Barron Docteur the anatomist who falls in love with Venus but spends much of the play exploiting her sees the timeless resonance in his characters perspective PERIOD

Its the ageold internal conflict the societal pressure versus what the heart wants Randall said PERIOD

Although Venus bluntly tackles issues of race and female objectification Michaelss take on the production isnt so black and white PERIOD

One of the things thats annoyed me is that the first thing people ask me about the play is thats a play about race right Michaels asked PERIOD But its not only a play about race its not only a play about black women its a play about people PERIOD I think you could have anyone from any exotic background in Venuss place  its about how we treat each other. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
