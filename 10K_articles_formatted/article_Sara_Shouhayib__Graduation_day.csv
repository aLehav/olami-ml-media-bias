Graduation day  the day we all look forward to our whole lives PERIOD After all its the time we finally receive our golden ticket that gets us into the workforce PERIOD I should be jumping for joy  no more exams allnighters and endless pages of reading to do that make me want to gouge my eyes out PERIOD Im about to graduate from one of the most amazing universities in the world PERIOD I mean I should be happy right  The truth is Ive never been more scared in my life PERIOD

But before I get into all of that I want to rewind back to the day that I got accepted as a transfer student from Grand Valley State University PERIOD  I was on vacation in Florida with my friend Alex in March  when my Mom called me PERIOD When I saw her name pop up on my caller ID I was positive she was calling just to fulfill her parental duty and make sure I was doing all right PERIOD But when I answered she said something that caught me off guard PERIOD Hello Miss Wolverine she said PERIOD I thought she was getting me confused with my sister for a second  she also went to school here PERIOD Once I realized she really did mean to call me I went screaming and running around like I had just won the lottery PERIOD I remember thinking it was the best day of my life PERIOD And in hindsight it still kind of is PERIOD

Being a transfer student as a sophomore was tough though PERIOD Everyone had already made their friends as freshman and I felt like a fish out of water PERIOD I joined club volleyball WOLVTV and the Lebanese Student Association PERIOD I quickly made friends and I started to feel a little more integrated into University life PERIOD

However I wasnt the typical college student  and with only a week left I dont think I ever will be PERIOD I didnt go to my graduation ceremony for any of my departments or walk in May with my class PERIOD I wasnt a big partier I hated going to football games and I went home a lot to see my family PERIOD I consistently complained about classes being stressful and always said things like Ugh Im so over school. but now that that time is here and it actually is going to be over I feel entirely different PERIOD

To be frank all I want to do is bundle up in my bed with Edys Cookies N Cream ice cream while clicking through past Facebook photos of my college journey and bawl my eyes out PERIOD I cant help but be upset that Ill no longer be a Michigan student anymore and that Ann Arbor will no longer be my home PERIOD

For the first time in my life I dont have a plan PERIOD I dont have a job lined up or any real agenda when it comes to the next few months PERIOD The nonstructured life that Im about to enter scares me more than the creepy little girl from The Ring. despite feeling all of that though Ill refrain from acting like the world is coming to an end PERIOD Instead Ill pick my head up and reminisce with elation that I was blessed to be a Michigan Wolverine PERIOD For Im thankful for the wonderful friendships that were formed the beautiful memories that were made the knowledge my professors provided me and for the person my University experience made me become PERIOD

I will miss Ann Arbor every day  it will always be one of my favorite cities on the planet PERIOD At the end of the day it was essentially what raised me PERIOD I came here as a girl and Im leaving as a woman PERIOD I dont know where Im going I dont know what life has in store for me and Im starting to come to the realization that thats OK PERIOD

Its true what they say  you never really know what youve got until its gone PERIOD Im not ready to say goodbye but I dont think I ever truly will be PERIOD Its time to close this chapter of my life with no regrets and smile about the fact that no matter what Ill always be a Michigan Wolverine PERIOD I will end my final piece with a quote I have engraved on my bracelet that I wear every day  Wherever you go go with all of your heart  and forever go blue. sara Shouhayib can be reached at sarashoumich.edu PERIOD
