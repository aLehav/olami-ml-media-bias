9356,2017-02-27,"sonoma State University announced it had achieved HispanicServing Institution status a designation that will make the school eligible to compete for millions of dollars in federal grants PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD Department of Education awards the designation to universities that are able to meet two requirements PERIOD

First Latinos must make up at least onequarter of the undergraduate student body PERIOD With a  percent Latino student population this requirement was met by Sonoma State PERIOD However the university failed to meet the second requirement which is having at least  percent of the student body receive federal financial aid PERIOD

Nonetheless obtaining HSI status had been a top priority for University President Judy K PERIOD Sakaki which is why a work group was formed to make a compelling case to the U.S PERIOD Department of Education on why they should award Sonoma State with the designation PERIOD

Sonoma State is committed to doing everything in its power to help all of our students be successful and graduate in a timely fashion so they can go out into the larger world and succeed there as well Sakaki said through a statement PERIOD

We submitted a 20page waiver and received support from congressmen Sakakis chief of staff and member of the work group Bill Kidder said PERIOD

Other members of the team that helped achieve the HSI designation are Chicano and Latino studies professors Ron Lopez and Daniel Malpica and psychology professor Eliza Velasquez PERIOD

Becoming a HSI was a key priority for President Sakaki because of the federal grant opportunities that will help our students and our campus Kidder said PERIOD

The grants the university will now be able to apply for are mostly used for tutoring outreach and STEM programs PERIOD

Kidder explained that although those funds have an emphasis in helping Latino students succeed they will have a positive impact in the university as a whole PERIOD

Apart from being able to apply for more federal grants HSI designation provides an opportunity for Sonoma State to create stronger partnerships with other universities and organizations that are also HSI PERIOD

Obtaining HSI is faithful to our core values and mission Kidder said PERIOD It places a spotlight on the importance of enhancing and valuing the diversity of our campus PERIOD I think that has value above and beyond the mere numbers of federal grants and so on. sakaki has made clear that increasing the universitys diversity is an important item on her teams agenda PERIOD Sonoma State was one of three California State Universities to not possess HSI designation PERIOD

CSU Maritime and CSU San Luis Obispo are now the only Cal State campuses that do not have HSI designation PERIOD

In the  academic year California produced  HispanicLatino high school graduates  of which came from Sonoma County according a report released by the university PERIOD

HSI designation presents an opportunity to get more Hispanic students into college and to show that Sonoma State is committed to diversity and that it is something we truly value

Associated Students Senator of Diversity Savannah Guinn said PERIOD

Another milestone for the university accompanied the HSI announcement  the formal announcement of the Dream Center for undocumented students by the Sakaki administration PERIOD

Both announcements came at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety from undocumented students and their communities due to new and stricter federal immigration guidelines PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Sakaki has made it very clear that she values diversity and will not tolerate intolerance Guinn said PERIOD I believe this designation could not have come at a more perfect time. nichols Hall   East Cotati AveRohnert Park CA 94928Telephone 7076642776Advertisingsonomastatestargmail.comCorrectionsNews Tips Business starsonoma.edu
