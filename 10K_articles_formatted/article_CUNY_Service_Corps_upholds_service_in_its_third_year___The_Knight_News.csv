The main purpose of the CUNY Service Corps is to help students give back to their community while learning valuable skills applicable toward their major Cesar OyervidesCisneros head of the Queens College section of the Service Corps said PERIOD We try to match participants up to service jobs in their area relating to their majors so that they can start applying what theyve learned in class and turn their theoretical class work into practical experience. entering the Service Corps is not easy PERIOD To be eligible participants must be fulltime students take a minimum of  credits and at least a . gPA PERIOD

The requirements to join the Corps are difficult in my opinion because we want to present the best of Queens College to the community OyervidesCisneros said PERIOD The requirements should serve as motivation for those students who are almost there to give it that extra push. alumni of the program after leaving continue to help and mentor new prospects for the Service Corps PERIOD

One club associated with the Service Corps is QC Serves PERIOD Run by former members of the program it hosts several events on campus throughout the academic year PERIOD Among those was the Ice Cream Social which took place on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Basically the point of the club is to engage students on and off campus and through different volunteer opportunities as well as social events Taylor Blanket president of QC Serves said PERIOD For many students on campus we see that they dont really have a place to call home and thats what we want to try and build for them here. although working with QC Serves is not the only option PERIOD Rohana Jo an alum of the program currently works with the Service Corps and educates prospective members before they begin PERIOD
