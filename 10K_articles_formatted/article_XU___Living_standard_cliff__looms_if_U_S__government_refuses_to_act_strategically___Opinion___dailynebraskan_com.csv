As many people celebrated on New Years Eve the United States officially fell off the fiscal cliff PERIOD However the U.S PERIOD Congress acted after that PERIOD On Tuesday Jan PERIOD  they passed the legislature and technically avoided falling off the cliff PERIOD If you have been paying attention to American politics for the last couple years you know this is a tradition PERIOD If there is a deadline Congress will act at the last second PERIOD The fiscal cliff is mainly a political problem and as long as the politicians get together even at the last second there will be a solution PERIOD For the real economic problems last second political actions wont help PERIOD Besides the fiscal cliff American people are facing a living standard cliff PERIOD Thats a real economic problem PERIOD Different from the fiscal cliff there is no deadline PERIOD To solve the problem a more strategic approach is necessary PERIOD If the government doesnt do the right thing to develop the economy falling off the living standard cliff could become a real danger PERIOD

If youve ever noticed some products have two price tags PERIOD One number is in the U.S PERIOD dollar USD and the other one is in the Canadian dollar CAD PERIOD For a long time the number in CAD is always higher than the USD PERIOD According to common sense the USD is more valuable PERIOD As a result to get the same merchandise Canadians have to pay more in their currency while the value would be the same with paying USD PERIOD But thats not the case PERIOD

For example Kaplan Inc PERIOD is a corporation focus on providing educational services PERIOD Its most famous for providing test preparations PERIOD The Kaplan  GMAT Premier published by Kaplan in  marked two prices at the back side of the book PERIOD One is in USD . pERIOD The other is in CAD . pERIOD If we just look at the prices the Canadians are paying approximately . percent more than Americans PERIOD If you assume that just reflects the currency exchange rate youre wrong PERIOD

However CAD is more valuable than USD PERIOD As of Jan PERIOD   800PM GMT one USD is about . cAD PERIOD Knowing this we can look back to that Kaplan GMAT book example and . cAD is worth about . uSD PERIOD This means that for the exact same product Canadians are paying roughly . percent more than Americans would PERIOD If this is the case for the whole economy Canadians are paying . percent more for the same product than Americans would pay PERIOD Hopefully this will discourage some Americans who are talking about moving to Canada PERIOD

Why would Canadians accept that Clearly thats not fair to them PERIOD There are a couple of reasons PERIOD First most people including many retailers cant believe that Canadian dollars are worth more than U.S PERIOD dollars PERIOD And they dont think this phenomenon will last PERIOD Second the U.S PERIOD dollars generally are worth more than Canadian dollars PERIOD Price tags cant reflect the fluctuation of the exchange rate instantly PERIOD

However if we take a look at the USDCAD currency exchange rate history USD is worth more than CAD in only four January May June and July out of the past  months PERIOD In other words last year Canadians were paying more than Americans more than half of the time PERIOD The situation is similar in  PERIOD Nevertheless when we look at the fluctuation of the exchange rate in a 10year scope there are only three years CAD was worth more than the USD PERIOD The first time is in  but it didnt last PERIOD In spite of that in  and  CAD was more valuable than USD during more than half of the time PERIOD This may become the new normal PERIOD

If we take a look at the debt market for the U.S PERIOD government you will find something interesting too PERIOD The Federal Open Market Committees FOMC set  percent as the mediumterm inflation target PERIOD Typically medium term for treasury investors means five to  years PERIOD According to the U.S PERIOD Department of the Treasury the rate of return the cost of the debt for fiveyear treasury note is much lower than one percent while the rate for 10year notes is lower than two percent PERIOD With the target inflation rate and the current yield the U.S PERIOD government is borrowing money at the creditors expense PERIOD To put it simply the one dollar borrowed today is more valuable than the one dollar plus interest in the future PERIOD As much as the U.S PERIOD Congress is criticizing the executive branch for borrowing money the Feds monetary policy made it possible for the U.S PERIOD to get paid for borrowing PERIOD A less valuable U.S PERIOD dollar is the side effect PERIOD This applies to the whole world not just to Canada PERIOD

To America as a nation there is nothing wrong with spending less while enjoying more PERIOD The problem is this situation isnt sustainable PERIOD If one day Americans have to pay the same price for the same product as the rest of the world and the U.S PERIOD government has to borrow money at a market rate people in the U.S PERIOD will experience a living standards cliff PERIOD If this nation falls off that cliff consumer goods will become unaffordable in a matter of days PERIOD This is fundamentally different from the fiscal cliff PERIOD A shortterm fix like passing legislation will not exist PERIOD

To normal American people the fluctuation of the exchange rate wouldnt have a material impact on daytoday life PERIOD Even so when retailers manufacturers or the raw material suppliers decide to accept the new normal that the U.S PERIOD dollars are not much different from other currencies the U.S PERIOD consumers will face the living standard cliff PERIOD To avoid this the federal government needs to take a more strategic approach to grow the economy and act as soon as possible PERIOD
