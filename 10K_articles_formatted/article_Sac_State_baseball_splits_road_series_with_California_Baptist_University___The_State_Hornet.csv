California Baptist University entered the weekend  in Western Athletic Conference play so a  series split on the road is nothing to sneeze at but with just four conference games remaining the Hornets chances of securing the WAC title are starting to dwindle as they trail both CBU and Grand Canyon University by four wins PERIOD

The biggest beneficiaries from the Hornets series split might just be GCU who is now tied for first place in the conference at  thanks to Sac State  WAC beating CBU   WAC twice PERIOD

Coming off last weekend where Sac State narrowly avoided being swept at home while scoring just nine runs in four games the Hornets nearly averaged nine runs per game this series PERIOD . runs over the four games

In a wild opening game of the series the Hornets got a road victory over the Lancers on an action packed Friday afternoon PERIOD The Hornets got the early lead on a Dawsen Bacho sacrifice fly before junior Brady Rodriguez  allowed three runs to the Lancers in the bottom of the second to give CBU a  lead PERIOD

The Hornets piled on runs in the third and fourth innings totaling  runs over the two frames punctuated by an emphatic grand slam by Sac States alltime RBI leader senior Matt Smith PERIOD

Offensive standouts for the Hornets include Smith who went  with a walk and five RBIs junior Nick Iwasa who went  with two runs and two RBIs and senior Ryan Walstad who went  and also had two runs and two RBIs PERIOD

Sac State dropped game one of the doubleheader on Saturday as pitcher Scott Randall  received his second loss of the season PERIOD The Hornets top pitcher struggled going only three innings allowing five runs while striking out five PERIOD Randalls start marked his shortest appearance and the five runs were the most he has allowed in a start all year PERIOD

The Hornets offense totaled just one run on six hits the run coming on a Smith RBI single scoring Walstad PERIOD

The Hornets found themselves trailing  heading to the ninth inning having put up just four runs in the first  innings of Saturdays double header PERIOD A walk an error and a single loaded the bases for Smith who had launched a grand slam in Fridays ballgame PERIOD

Smith didnt unload the bases but he knocked in two on a base hit to bring the game within a run PERIOD Junior Dylan McPhillips then hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at six PERIOD

Jack Zalasky  pitched a  bottom of the ninth to send the game to extra innings PERIOD The Hornets missed an opportunity in the tenth inning however squandering runners on first and third with nobody out PERIOD Freshman Isaiah Parker struck out freshman Jack Bollengier bunted it back to the pitcher and then Zalasky struck out to end the inning PERIOD

In the bottom of the tenth the Lancers capitalized where the Hornets could not with the bases loaded Ulises Caballero singled home the winning run off Zalasky to win it for CBU PERIOD

Freshman Eli Saul  pitched well while going five innings giving up only two runs keeping the Hornets in the ball game PERIOD Sophomore Rylan Tinsley pitched a scoreless frame before freshman Kevin Haynes allowed four runs over two innings two of those coming on a tworun homer from Mitchel Simon his second of the series PERIOD

Despite the comefrombehind efforts the Hornets still lost as they dropped their sixth game of their last eight PERIOD

California Baptists . eRA is the lowest in the Western Athletic Conference but on Sunday the Lancers pitching staff had no answers for the Sac State offense PERIOD

Walstad started the show for the Hornets by tagging a tworun homer in the first to begin the scoring PERIOD Two innings later Matt Smith added a tworun homer of his own to make it a  Hornet lead PERIOD
