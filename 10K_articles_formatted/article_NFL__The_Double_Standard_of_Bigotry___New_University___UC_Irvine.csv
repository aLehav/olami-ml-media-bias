2638,2023-11-04,"the boy who cried wolf has nothing on the boy who cried bigot PERIOD This has been the war cry of the homosexual movement ever since its emergence quick to criticize and accuse others who are not tolerant of their ways PERIOD Those who feel themselves so much more advanced in the state of humanity so much more twenty-first centuryesque because of their tolerance to the homosexual lifestyle might want to take out a page from their own bibles PERIOD Bigotry goes both ways my friend PERIOD This could not have been more evident with the recent events of the NFL draft PERIOD

Michael Sam the controversial football player out of Missouri because of his homosexuality was recently drafted by the St PERIOD Louis Rams PERIOD What ensued was a barrage of liberally controlled left wing media coverage about this one individual PERIOD His name hit the headlines moments after his draft and carried on for the next few days PERIOD Many were quick to heap praises on the man prematurely dubbing him as the bulldozer for a newer generation of inclusivity PERIOD President Obama even went out of his way to congratulate him for taking an important step forward in our nations history. oh and lets not forget he won the Arthur Ashe Award PERIOD Well kudos to you Mr PERIOD Sam PERIOD

The White House couldnt have said it better when they said you should be judged for what you do and not who you are. looks like the liberal media didnt get the memo PERIOD No one knows that he is a defensive end out of Missouri had  tackles over his collegiate career and is a  SEC defensive player of the year PERIOD Instead everyone knows him as the courageous football player who despite all the trying circumstances managed to get drafted into the NFL as the quintessential underdog PERIOD Again kudos to you Mr PERIOD Sam PERIOD

There exists a double standard in this country PERIOD If you are not homosexual a minority or anything different like that no one will care about you unless they are an aficionado of the sport PERIOD If you are then you are the second coming PERIOD You are glorified by all and given all benefit of the doubt PERIOD Youre the next Rosa Parks PERIOD

Jason Collins comes to mind PERIOD No team in the NBA wanted him yet he was still getting superstar coverage simply because he was gay PERIOD Many were quick to blame homophobia as the reason for him not being employed by the association PERIOD Then someone picked him up and there was a firestorm of media coverage PERIOD The First Lady eventually invited him as a personal guest to the State of the Union Address PERIOD Just because he was gay and advancing humanity. this is not advancing humanity PERIOD It is not advancing humanity when the world chooses to glorify a certain type of people for one aspect of their lives PERIOD Like the White House said you should be recognized for your achievements not who you are PERIOD If he is gay so be it PERIOD That doesnt give him the right to be put on a pedestal above all others PERIOD

It is not advancing humanity when another player gets fined for criticizing Sams drafting into the league PERIOD It is not advancing humanity when you can get fined simply because you hold an opinion contrary to popular belief and are then forced to apologize for your beliefs PERIOD Many NFL players were against Sam but knew speaking out would bring consequences PERIOD This was the same issue as the Donald Sterling controversy PERIOD He had an opinion and was ridiculed for believing it PERIOD

It is not advancing humanity when Sam gets praised because of his homosexuality but others like Tebow are openly criticized for their faithful Christianity PERIOD It is Tebows right to believe and practice what he believes yet he is openly criticized for believing his faith while Sam is given a platform to preach his message His kissing his partner after being drafted is disturbing enough not because it is between two men but because things of that nature shouldnt be on open television in the first place PERIOD

Call me a bigot PERIOD Call me intolerant PERIOD Call me a virus to humanity PERIOD That doesnt take away from the fact that you doing so makes you as much of a bigot as I because you are intolerant to my beliefs PERIOD Bigotry goes both ways and therein lies the fundamental problem of a postmodern relativistic society PERIOD Absolutes are thrown out the window PERIOD
