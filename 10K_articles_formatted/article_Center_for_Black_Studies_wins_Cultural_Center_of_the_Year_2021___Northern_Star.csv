DeKALB  The Center for Black Studies received the Cultural Center of the Year  and Innovative Website awards by the Association of Black Cultural Centers in October to recognize all of the hard work everyone has put into the Center for Black Studies PERIOD

The center was built in  due to many protests when the campus was first integrated with Black and white students PERIOD

Were absolutely a place to support Black students but all students and really student learning in a lot of ways right because our goal is to help educate the NIU community about the African diaspora right while also being this space of support for students Edwards said PERIOD

Since becoming the acting director four years ago and then the director of the center two years ago Edwards said she has much more of a strategic and transformational visionary mindset but she has worked with others to keep CBS growing PERIOD

The encouragement that I gave to my staff and the empowerment to say what would you like to see different How can we do things differently How can we reenvision how can we see this in a different light represent this to campus and I think that as a team we have made good solid strides Edwards said PERIOD

Edwards said CBS has added and strengthened their Black Studies minor added a certificate program strengthened their retention programs and the list goes on PERIOD

Edwards said the Cultural Center of the Year was awarded on behalf of all of their hard work PERIOD

It was certainly recognition of the work because sometimes working in Diversity Equity and Inclusion It can be a job that goes without recognition Edwards said PERIOD You know because a lot of the recognition is seeing the outcomes of the students so to be recognized by our peers other people other folks that are doing this work was very special to me. edwards attended the Association of Black Cultural Centers conference virtually while sitting in the center with no one else around PERIOD She was absolutely shocked that they won the award and texted one of their group chats telling them the news PERIOD

We recognize that we do this work to really make impacts on our campus which then impacts our community which then impacts our society and thats the true reward of it all PERIOD

This award recognizes a Center who has curated a significant level of innovation with their website design and interface said Dione Reynolds Upperman African American Cultural Center mentor via email PERIOD The website should have elements that are not commonly found on other centers websites PERIOD The website should be intuitive to navigate and aesthetically appealing. edwards has a goal to continue toward excellence PERIOD

I really think that our goal is to be an excellent cultural center thats my goal Edwards said PERIOD My goal is to be excellent and excellence is not perfection PERIOD I believe that if we operate in excellence that we support and educate develop if we do all of the things that we have been doing and we continue to reimagine revision and keep it moving that we wont have to align ourselves to win anything PERIOD We will just be already there. campus
