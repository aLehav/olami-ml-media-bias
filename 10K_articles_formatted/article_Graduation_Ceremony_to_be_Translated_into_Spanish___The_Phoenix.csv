8919,2011-04-26,"editors note This article was initially published in The Daily Gazette Swarthmores online daily newspaper founded in Fall  PERIOD As of Fall  the DG has merged with The Phoenix PERIOD See the about page to read more about the DG PERIOD

For the first time this year the Swarthmore College commencement ceremony will be translated into Spanish PERIOD For several years the ceremony has been translated into American Sign Language but the college recently purchased the equipment necessary to make verbal simultaneous translation possible PERIOD

This year parents and other family members of graduating students will have the option of requesting a translating device PERIOD The devices are small and handheld with headphones PERIOD The listener puts on the headphones and then chooses a channel that will correspond to an audio feed in a certain language PERIOD

This year the translation will only be in Spanish PERIOD But the devices do have multiple channels so in the future the ceremony could be simultaneously translated into more than one language PERIOD The user would simply set the device to the channel with their language of choice PERIOD

The Spanish translation will be done by Spanish Professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt PERIOD She explained the process of translation saying that the translators receives through headphones a very clear feed of the speakers words and then translates it speaking into a microphone which will broadcast to the handheld devices PERIOD

She said that it is much easier to translate a person reading a prepared speech than someone speaking freely as they speak more slowly but she still described the process as exhausting and is looking for an alternate translator to work for part of the graduation ceremony PERIOD

Camacho de Schmidt has been advocating for the equipment for several years both for when lecturers who are not English speakers come to campus and to help teach students the craft of simultaneous translation PERIOD A recent decrease in the price and physical size of the equipment has now made the purchase possible and she says that it will be used for events other than graduation PERIOD

It creates a bigger community and brings everyone inside the circle showing that everyone matters PERIOD It honors the students whose families cannot speak English by showing that they are thought of and considered said Camacho de Schmidt PERIOD

Deivid Rojas  a former Student Council Vice President and the originator of the idea to translate the ceremony agreed with Professor Schmidt PERIOD

This comes from the process of thinking about accessibility and discussing strategic planning and key terms that have been mentioned and emphasized like globalization PERIOD If we are to grow in this globalized world we need to make sure that our own students and our own students parents have equitable access said Rojas PERIOD

There are lots of small but important things to do to improve how parents approach the school and feel close he continued PERIOD A person who does not speak English will have a different response and relationship to the College PERIOD Hispanics are the largest minority in America and we need to keep up with these trends not just with this issue but also with the percentage of students and faculty and staff PERIOD  This is just one piece of the process. rojas first conceived the idea two years ago PERIOD His mother speaks English but his father only speaks Spanish and he noticed a discrepancy in how they could interact with the College PERIOD Rojas brought his concern directly to Vice President Maurice Eldridge who was receptive and immediately began the process using some of Professor Schmidts previous research to decide which translation devices to purchase PERIOD

The administrations response to this specific need was excellent PERIOD I made the case and made myself available to help but Eldridge understood the necessity and got things moving along said Rojas PERIOD

After a two year planning process the graduation ceremony will now be available in Spanish with possibly more languages to come PERIOD
