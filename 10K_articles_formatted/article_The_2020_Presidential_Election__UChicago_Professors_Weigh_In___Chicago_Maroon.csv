2220,2022-03-16,"grey City sat down withUChicagopolitical science professors to discuss the issues and the stakes of the upcoming United States presidential election PERIOD Heres what they had to say

The increasingly fraught and polarized political scene has sparkeddoubtsamong academics about the stability of our democracy PERIOD Political scienceand lawprofessor Ginsburgventuresan answer to this concern in his new bookHow to Save a Constitutional Democracy PERIOD

Ginsburg explained that Americas electoral system plays no small part in creating the fragility of the United States politics PERIOD The issues at play were foreseen by the founding fathers he said but they didnt account for party loyalties to rise above a politicians ambition in his own branch of government PERIOD In other words he explained American democracy is not immune to bad actors PERIOD

If you have a leader who is really trying to destroy democracy actively and had the cooperation of the judges that person would be able to succeed I think PERIOD The constitution is not a foolproof system Ginsburg said PERIOD

The dangers of such a leader is that they undermine the efficacy of the institutions the Constitution has put forth and the peoples faith in the institutions themselves PERIOD

Charismatic populists are people who claim to represent the people exclusively PERIOD So the leader alone knows what the people want PERIOD Those people have an inherent distrust and thus try to undermine any intermediary institutions between the people and the leader which includes the bureaucracy media and courts Ginsburg said PERIOD A constitutional democracy cannot truly exist without these institutions functioning well PERIOD We need to follow the rule of law and not whatever the whims are of who happens to be the leader. despite these concerns Ginsburg is decidedly not worried that President Donald Trump will refuse to step down ifformerVice President Joe Biden wins the election PERIOD The cause for his optimism Optics PERIOD In his view bad television would be the worstcase scenario for a former star of a reality show PERIOD

There has been a lot of speculation about this What if theElectoralCollege votes in December for Biden but Trump refuses to step down Im not worried about that at all because constitutionally a new president will be sworn in on January  PERIOD If need be President Trump would have to be removed by theSecretService which would be very bad television PERIOD Since he is going to rely on television for his future career if he loses this election I dont see that happeningGinsburg said PERIOD

However what Ginsburg does worry about is a possible impending constitutional legitimacy crisis PERIOD

Ifthere is a state where there is close election and the state legislature which formally has the responsibility of sending the electors to theElectoralCollege Ginsburg explains if you had them overturn the will of the people in that state which would be legal and constitutional under our system it would create a major constitutional crisis. according to Ginsburg the very foundation of the American constitution or reallythat ofany democracy is that the representatives act in the interest of their constituents PERIOD A deliberate dismissal of the will of the people might shake peoples confidence in the legitimacy of a constitution that allows that PERIOD

Fortunately in July the Supreme Court ruled thatfaithless electorscan no longer go rogueas part ofthe Electoral College PERIOD

One integral aspect of a functioning democracy is its fair and unbiased electionsa vital institution that is rapidly degrading in America and falling far behind its peers Ginsburg said PERIOD

There is no rich democracy that runs elections as badly as the United States Ginsburg said PERIOD Indeed there are many poor countries that run elections much better. this is in part because the U.S.has a highly decentralized system of election administration PERIOD

In our country we leave the rules of our voting to the states and some of them not only dont try to facilitate their citizens voting but they try to hinder it Ginsburg said PERIOD The people running these elections are partisan officials theyre Secretaries of State which in most states are elected officials of one party or the other. ginsburg proposes the creation of a partyneutral federal bureaucracy to oversee U.S.elections PERIOD

Ultimately in Ginsburgs view threats to our constitutional democracy did not startnor will they end with Donald Trump PERIOD

Trump is a symptom of and an accelerant of the erosion of our democracy which preceded his election and will probably continue regardless of what happens next month says Ginsburg PERIOD We have to look not just at the personality but at the institutions and the processes that got us to this point. after a Democratic primary season that put candidatesparticularly female candidateselectability under the microscopeprofessor Linda Zerilli of theDepartment ofPolitical Science who studies the role of women and gender in politics said that in choosing Kamala Harris as hisvicepresidential nominee Joe Biden made the politically smart choice. he as an individual understands the importance of bringing people who have different experiences and perspectives into his administration Zerilli said PERIOD The way in which he builds his cabinet will matter. but Zerilli is not only concerned with representation she is also keeping an eye out for what roles women would play in his cabinet PERIOD She noted that historically women have often been appointed to cabinet positions associated with female gender norms such as education PERIOD

It will be interesting to see if he brings women into roles that we dont normally see women inlike security foreign policy and so on PERIOD This is what Obama did with Hillary Clinton Zerilli said PERIOD

Some havearguedthat Bidens commitment to choosing a woman as his running mate would merely be a performative gesture and a disservice to the nominee and the public due to the emphasis on gender over policy PERIOD This critique was alsoappliedwhen Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court PERIOD Still Zerilli does not believe that this critique applies to Harris PERIOD

I think that Kamala Harris has a very clear sense of the extra burdens that women have in this society particularly with the pandemic and the way in which the pandemic disproportionately affects women especially women of color but women generally Zerillielaborated PERIOD She will bring that experience to her role as VP. on the broader topic of women representatives in Washington Zerilli said that women in Congress have taken up the role of truth teller. there are now more women serving in Congress thanks to the last election where women came in in record numbers PERIOD I think to some people the very presence of women in Congress is already very agitating but in some cases they do have to be willing to take the risk of saying things that may not make them likable like naming the elephant in the roomZerilli said PERIOD

Congresswomen have become truth tellers in the sense of bringing to light perspectives and systemic problems long ignored but that does not necessarily mean there is more truth in politics than usual PERIOD Zerillis most recent publication revolved around truthtelling in politics a practice of which the past four years have seen a concerning decline PERIOD

It concerns me when democratic citizens stop expecting that their representatives tell them the truth PERIOD That should be an expectation PERIOD Not that representatives arent going to failthey willbut we should still demand that of themZerilli said PERIOD

She extended this criticism to the Presidents withholding information about theseverity of thepandemicearlier this year PERIOD

To say that I didnt want to scare people is not a satisfactory way of dealing with democratic citizens she said PERIOD We are adults and we need to know what is actually happening in our world so we can decide how we are going to collectively manage these problems. assistantprofessor of political scienceRuth Bloch Rubin who studies American politics and political parties discussed the stakes of the upcoming election and the partisan aspects of the electoral process PERIOD

Asked about concerns that President Trump would refuse to leave office if voted out Bloch Rubin said that while she does not believe that the country is on the verge of dictatorship there is still a lot at stake in this election PERIOD

There are really salient policy reasons why this election matters whether we get an economic recovery bill how big whether the stimulus bill works whether people are pulled into even deeper poverty or lifted out whether our schools will be able to open and runthose are the issues at stake she said PERIOD The equalizing nature of the pandemic has made it easier for people to see each other as neighbors. bloch Rubin is not concerned about Donald Trump staying in power after Inauguration Day PERIOD In her view the ambitions of other politicians will safeguard the United States against a dictatorship PERIOD

Im fairly confident at minimum in the ambitions of other Republicans to prevent the current president from staying in power longer than he was intended to PERIOD If I am a Republican who wants to run for president someday I cant if there is a dictator said Bloch Rubin PERIOD

While Bloch Rubin does not perceive an imminent threat of dictatorship she does not believe that national elections provide completely fair representation PERIOD Bloch Rubin supports abolishing theElectoralCollege in favor of a popular vote PERIOD

I think it is important for people elected to national office to reflect the popular will and so if the majority of Americans want person A then that person should be the president PERIOD It shouldnt matter whether your state is more or less populous that seems to increase the odds that people will find electoral outcomes illegitimate. indeed President Trumps winning of theElectoralCollege and loss of the popular vote in the  election provoked many to say that he wasnotmypresident.One reason pundits speculatethattheClinton campaign failedto win theElectoralCollege is that it spent most of its time trying to persuade voters in swing states instead of focusing on turning out votes in blue wall states a group of states previously thought to be strongly Democraticlike Pennsylvania and Wisconsin PERIOD

In politically polarized times the population of moderate voters appears to be dwindling as the gap between the driving political ideologies of the Republican and Democratic Parties continues to widen PERIOD As far as the disappearance of this socalledundecidedblock of voters Bloch Rubin argues that some would say there were never undecided voters.When you ask people what their party affiliation is you do have some people who will identify as independents and we tend to think of these people as undecided PERIOD There are many people who for whatever reason want to identify as independent but vote like partisans. moreover Bloch Rubin explains We do have a small number of people who flipflop PERIOD Theresthe mythical Obama to Trump voter or Trump to Biden voter that these candidates have to persuade PERIOD In a very close election every votecounts so it is hard to deny that those individuals arent important but turnout of the base is also important PERIOD If you can turn out the people who often dont participate but ideologically agree with you then you wouldnt need to care about these undecideds. with November3 rapidly approaching the division and distrust between Americans of different political parties is onlygrowing PERIOD

For Eric Oliver a professor of political science who studies contemporary American politics and political psychology the polarization gripping the United States and the reason why you cant find commonality with yourcrazy uncle who you have to see on Thanksgiving is more than just ideological disagreement PERIOD

One reason why its hard for the left and the right to talk to each other and understand what the other side is saying is largely because its not simply just a difference in ideology its a difference in worldview he said PERIOD

This difference in worldview that Oliver describes is between what he calls intuitionists and rationalists. intuitionists are people who utilize their gut feelings or intuition and theyre heavily swayed by symbols and metaphors.Theyre the kinds of people who have a lot of supernatural beliefs and paranormal beliefs he said PERIOD A rationalist has kind of an Enlightenment worldview PERIOD They rely on production logic facts science. having either an intuitionistorrationalist way of thinking is not necessarily exclusive to political belief PERIOD However Oliver said that over the past  years the rise of the evangelical right as a core constituency group within conservative circles has led the Republican Party to embrace the intuitionist worldview PERIOD

As a consequence of that youll see a lot more rhetoric on the right that expresses this kind of intuitionist worldview PERIOD And one of those types of rhetoric is conspiracy theories Oliver said PERIOD

Fromclaimingthat undocumented immigrants commit massive voter fraud tosending out a text message thatantifa supporters attack American homes throughout the past four years Donald Trump has openly trafficked in and given rise to theories that have been continuously disproven PERIOD Among his most outspoken supporters include believers in QAnon a farright multilevel government conspiracy theory PERIOD When intuitionism gets concentrated in the hands of a single party like what were seeing now sort of in the concentration of Trumps presidency I think what youre going to see is a recipe for disaster Oliver said PERIOD

This matters not just because of what voters believebut alsobecauseof what they do not PERIOD The shared sense of reality that should anchor political discourse perishes PERIOD For intuitionists what are considered facts by rationalists may become meaningless PERIOD They may not be swayed by statistics on coronavirus deaths for example because they wont believe itmainstream news developments contradict their reality PERIOD

Democracy on the other hand relies on an informed public responding to reallife facts in a rational way PERIOD

Democracy is conditioned to things like compromise and a shared assessment of what a fact is PERIOD Intuitionism is based on the symbol and metaphor and emotion Oliver said PERIOD Those types of tendencies usually express themselves in very undemocratic ways.Theirintuition is not very tolerant of dissent. how this deeply polarizing struggle and debate over reality will shake up the state of American democracy is yet to be known but Oliver remains optimistic PERIOD

I think Joe Biden is pretty likely to win the election and a big part of his appeal is from people who are rejecting this kind of intuitionist politics he said PERIOD

I also sort of see just on a daytoday level American democratic norms are still pretty strongly instilled in the vast majority of the country PERIOD Most people are pretty committed to democratic discourse despite the polarization in our politics you see a lot of small individual acts of decency PERIOD And those are the things that actually give me the greatest confidenceOliver said

According to theMueller Reportreleased earlier this year the  election was influenced in some part by statesponsored Russian online disinformation campaigns PERIOD Many onlookers have been concerned with the security of U.S PERIOD elections and apparent ease with which they can be manipulated given the unprecedented rise of mailin ballots and dissemination of misinformation criticizing electoral procedures and legitimacy PERIOD

AssistantprofessorZhaotianLuo who studies the role of information in politics said that majority rule elections are easy to manipulate because there is a clear result either a candidate wins or loses PERIOD There are two main ways in which candidates manipulate elections PERIOD First they could simply falsify the election results if they know they could not win honestly PERIOD But the second way is more subtle leading up to the election the candidate could build confidence that they will win such that their claim to victory goes unchallenged no matter how narrow the margin PERIOD

Luo thinks that in the upcoming general election the second way is a more likely outcome PERIOD In the case that there is not a landslide victory Trump might announce his own victory and that may be enough to persuade others from challenging him Luo explained PERIOD Or even if he loses by a slim marginhe can accuse the other side of manipulation and that would make any election result suspicious. postmaster General LouisDeJoy appointed by the TrumpappointedUSPS Board of Governorshad announced thatredundant or seldom usedmailboxes would be removed but backlash from constituents forced a reversal of this policy PERIOD President Trumps attempts to weaken the USPS serve to discourage eligible people from voting and undermine their confidence in the security of voting by mail PERIOD Luo said that if Trumpissuccessful in changing the information conveyed by the election results by deterring voting then he might not be as popular as the voting result shows. manipulating an election is a balancing act of scaleaccording to Luo PERIOD If one manipulates too much then people would lose faith and make the conclusion that they dont believe the election result and go to the streets to protest PERIOD One must manipulate just right so that although people have suspicion that he has manipulated election results not to the extent that would make people willing to go on the streetLuoexplained PERIOD

Most attempts to manipulate the outcomes of an election are obscured enough to be easily overlooked or explained which is why it can be difficult to form a defense PERIOD Luo views the debate over voter ID laws from the  election as an example of subtle election manipulation PERIOD

In the previous election there was a debate about requiring ID in the poll station specifically to make some Democrats more difficult to cast a vote for PERIOD The problem is that such an action as requiring an ID is totally constitutional and Republicans have a rationale for it PERIOD This kind of manipulation which we could not even confidently categorize as manipulation is the most difficult to prevent. given Russian interference in the  election and potentially in the upcoming  election Luo commented on the comparative magnitude of the threats saying that domestic manipulation is on a much bigger scale than foreign manipulation. mailinballot counts so farshowan unprecedented level of civic participation before Election Day PERIOD Voting before Election Day this year was largely expanded because of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic andtens of millions of Americans have already voted PERIOD

However the expansion of votebymail has become a frequent point of contention this election cycle PERIOD Anthony Fowler an associate professorinthe Harris School of Public Policy said that although voting by mail brings up new challenges for the election process there is no reason to doubt its security PERIOD

There are some reasons for me to be worried about mail voting since there are additional security risks relative to inperson voting PERIOD For example mail voting could make it easier for someone to cast someone elses ballot tamper with ballots or coerce someone to vote in a particular way he said PERIOD However there are lots of people working this election cycle to mitigate the risks and there is currently no evidence of widespread fraud. throughout the election cycle Republicans and the Trump administration have repeatedlyattackedthe integrity of mailin voting and reforms that make voting more accessible PERIOD Fowler chalked this up to a broader more diverse voting demographic that may emerge through these changes PERIOD

The evidence does suggest that if everyone voted this would likely benefit the Democratic Party in the short term because young people poorer people and nonwhite people are much less likely to vote under our current system and these groups are more likely to vote blue PERIOD Despite this fact he adds that studies find that mail voting does not systematically benefit either major party. still many Democrats hope that the current trajectory of early turnout is indicative of additional voters for former VicePresident Joe Biden PERIOD While almost half of all likely voters plan to vote early aWashington PostABC pollconducted from October  through October  shows a sharp partisan breakdown over when people say they will cast their ballot PERIOD  of likely Biden voters said they planned on voting early PERIOD In comparison  of likely Trump voters said they plan to vote on Election Day PERIOD

Fowler warns against trying to make early predictions on the election outcome based on current earlyvoting turnout PERIOD

Its hard to know whether the increase in votebymail and early voting is a sign that many people are eager to vote against an unpopular incumbent or if the people who would have voted anyway are voting early because of the pandemic he said PERIOD

Right now Fowler says that dispersing accurate information about voting to the public is one of the most important things government officials as well as the media should be doing to make voting as easy and as secure as possible PERIOD

Trust in election results is perhaps the most important thing in a democracyFowler said PERIOD
