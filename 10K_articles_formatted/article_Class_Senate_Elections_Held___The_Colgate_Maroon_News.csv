The Student Government Association SGA held elections for the Student Senate last Thursday PERIOD However the Classes of  and  did not have their elections PERIOD

Each class holds its own election and although many run for positions there are only twelve senators per class PERIOD This year the senior and junior classes did not have elections because not enough people ran for positions PERIOD

The Class of  had  candidates running for the senate so as a result all candidates were given a position automatically PERIOD The Class of  had eight candidates running so those eight have all been given positions as well PERIOD The remaining four slots for the senior class are available on a firstcome firstserve basis PERIOD

Any student can run for the senate PERIOD The student must pick up a petition from the SGA office have it signed by a number of people in their class and hand it in with a 100word statement describing himself or herself and why someone should vote for him or her PERIOD On election day students log into their portal accounts and vote online PERIOD

With this relatively easy process why did so few people run for positions in the junior and senior class Is there a lack of interest in student government

According to SGA president senior David Kusnetz that is not the whole story PERIOD

It is true that seniors may not feel as inclined to be involved in the student government Kusnetz said PERIOD Its their last year theyre on their way out so they have less motive to be active in it. this may be expected of the senior class PERIOD

The junior class results were also apparently not a big surprise PERIOD

There is a good chunk of juniors who are abroad right now elections commissioner sophomore Andrew Eldredge said PERIOD A lot of the students are away and so we can predict there will be less people running to represent that smaller group. whats also important to remember is that this process is relatively new PERIOD The new student constitution was written two years ago Kusnetz said PERIOD Before that we had senators by dorm not by class PERIOD Were still working out some kinks in the process. fortunately there were no problems with the elections for the classes of  and  PERIOD

It was very impressive Eldredge said PERIOD In the firstyear class  people ran for positions and in the sophomore class there were  candidates PERIOD We were glad to see the amount of interest. the SGA has many initiatives and the senate plays an important part PERIOD

The power of the senate is in its representation Kusnetz said PERIOD Senators have leverage in negotiating because they represent a certain percentage of the student body PERIOD They can be active voices for their classmates. this year some of the SGAs goals are to reform the textbook policy at the Colgate Bookstore work on environmental awareness and initiatives on campus and take a look at the Office of Residential Lifes policies and processes PERIOD

Class council elections are next Tuesday and there are also governance board elections PERIOD Class council positions are available to all students and students who are sophomores or older can be in the governance boards PERIOD Students who would like to learn more about SGA can visit the office in the OConnor Campus Center PERIOD
