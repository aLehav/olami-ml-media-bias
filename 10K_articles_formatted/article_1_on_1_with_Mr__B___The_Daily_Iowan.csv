Well yeah I know  many of you spent the last week in blissedout wonderment Performanceenhanced Hmmm. in some exotic location Texas maybe or Florida PERIOD Perhaps Mexico PERIOD

No offense to Maryland of course PERIOD Its just that I lived there once and if you want to take the exotic out of exotic places live there PERIOD As an old pal of mine once wrote in a song Theres no place to go thats not here PERIOD

So I took a gander at the economy which more and more seems to resemble a pigsty without the pigs well OK theres AIG  with the pigs and decided Id leave my money under my mattress and travel only to Hoopsland PERIOD

Actually I dont own a mattress so good luck breaking into my place and finding the money PERIOD I was speaking metaphorically about the mattress PERIOD And the money. hoopsland which also goes by the moniker mens basketball NCAA Tournament is indeed an exotic place a country you can visit for very little or no money and discover how ignorant and silly you are PERIOD

Luckily it only comes around once a year  discovering how ignorant and silly you are all the time would begin to seem like a complit class PERIOD

This year just to make things more exotic I decided to challenge President Barack Obama in the tourney PERIOD I mean hes famous for his jump shot I am not but I was moderately famous for my behindtheback passes with either hand back shortly after the invention of the printing press and his NCAA picks are posted online at ESPN.com so I said Game on Mr PERIOD B PERIOD

Well PERIOD

I have to admit I didnt quite get off to the jackrabbit start Id been dreaming of  that gorgeous 32of32 that leaves your opponent with eyes the size of a Harvest Moon because youre doing the harvesting and hes going Were those AIG bonuses that just plowed me under

No I rather stumbled out to a 23of32 start PERIOD In Hoopsland thats somewhere below pedestrian PERIOD Actually its worse than that  its like trying to play ball with your shoes tied together PERIOD And if Im being honest I had some moments playing ball in which I couldnt have played any worse had my shoes been tied together PERIOD

But Mr PERIOD B of the famous jump shot In all honesty he looked like a genius in dealing with the AIG brouhaha compared with his first round in the tournament 19of32 which in the way these things are calculated according to Aristotles formula  points for the first round  points for the second etc. gave him  points to my  PERIOD

Hah I thought PERIOD Wheres that jump shot now Youre going to wish youd stuck to AIG PERIOD I chestbumped my ceiling PERIOD

Dont try that at home PERIOD For one thing you probably dont live in an attic. of course the thing about the tournament and for that matter life is that it doesnt stop after the first round PERIOD Theres this thing called the second round PERIOD

Well PERIOD

I admit I got a little nervous on the first day of the second round when Mr PERIOD B went 8for8 and I went  ahem  5of8 PERIOD Some jump shot huh

The rest of the second round didnt go much better Mr PERIOD B wound up 14of16 in the Sweet Sixteen and I ended up 11of16 in the SemiSour Sixteen giving him  points to my  PERIOD

I didnt chestbump my ceiling PERIOD My shoes seemed to be tied together PERIOD

Well theres always the third round I said PERIOD Besides isnt Mr PERIOD B supposed to be worrying about those AIG bonuses

Actually he already has  he took the money out of the latest AIG bailout PERIOD I wish I could get a bailout  then Id have more than metaphorical money. thats Hoopsland for you  exotically demonstrating how ignorant and silly you are PERIOD

I sure am glad Im not taking a complit class PERIOD",1-on-1 with Mr. B - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
