In  the United States was ranked No PERIOD  in the world for college completion PERIOD As of  the country has moved down to No PERIOD  in the rankings PERIOD Dr PERIOD William Spriggs of Howard Universitys Department of Economics spoke to University students onOct PERIOD 12about the recent trend of public deinvestment in education PERIOD

Some of the most shocking examples of this can be seen right here in Pennsylvania where state funding of college education has been cut by  percent since  and in Arizona where it has been cutby  percent PERIOD

We stopped trying to be number one Spriggs said of states who are increasingly appropriating less money for students tuition PERIOD He described how it has now become the students role to make their college education affordable you either pay or you dont. spriggs explainedthatit is impossible for the United States to stay in first place when subsidies are being reduced PERIOD One of the most popular solutionstotax cuts is a general shrink of government involvement which then results in a decrease in educational investments PERIOD A common excuse used to defendthis trend is why should we be subsidizing your college experience if youre going to be making money in the end as a doctor or lawyer

Universities are marketdriven institutions fighting to remain competitive and stay in business Spriggs explained PERIOD Therefore they do not focus on acquiring students from the bottom 50percent whose population is primarily composed of minority groups PERIOD They aim to appeal to the richest  percent who account for  percent of all U.S PERIOD expenditures on education PERIOD

Associate Professor of Economics Nina Banks has firsthand experience with thiswide scaledeinvestment process PERIOD As an undergraduate she attended an allwomens collegewhich enrolled mostly uppermiddle class students and hadvery little racialorsocioeconomic diversity and as a graduate student she attended a state school in Massachusetts at the time when the state began to deinvest in higher education PERIOD

Sadly we saw the effects of this deinvestment with loss of money for teaching assistantships and new faculty positions and with increased tuition.This had the effect of making the university less affordable for lowincome and middleclass students at both the undergrad and graduate levels Banks said PERIOD

According to Spriggs universities are now striving to appeal only to a target group of elite customers who can afford to pay a hefty college tuition PERIOD For example SAT scores and family income are highly correlated PERIOD Therefore schools will often raise their average scores in order to make themselves look better PERIOD This ultimately drives out many of the underrepresented minority students whose familys median incomecannot keep up PERIOD

Colleges are doing such a disservice to society because they are the reason the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to increase Julienne Egofske  said PERIOD

The top  percent says go ahead and continue to raise the prices to match my income so I dont have to be around poor people according to Spriggs PERIOD This leaves the middle class asking What about us How do we get an education to advance our lives and careers

Professor of Economics Geoff Schneider suggested If we really want to help people escape poverty in this country while also providing employers with the most skilled work force possible we should be moving towards a system in which everyone who wants to go to college can do so PERIOD Policies enacted by state legislatures and governors to slash funding for higher education make little economic sense and we should in fact be moving in the opposite direction following the lead of the rest of the developed world. experts in the field of watershed science and engineering will present on a wide range of topics when the Bucknell Center for Sustainability  the Environment BCSE hosts..

One question do these percentages reflect actual reductions in state appropriations or are they the result of flat appropriations divided by a growing institutional budget  Thanks PERIOD",Economics professor talks de-investment in higher education - The Bucknellian,Bucknell University
