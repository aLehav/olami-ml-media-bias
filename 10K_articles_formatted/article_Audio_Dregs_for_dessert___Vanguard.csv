Portlands progressive electronic music scene is getting stronger by the minute PERIOD Our standard crop of decent DJs has remained consistent PERIOD On the experimental side bedroom electronic experimentalists break new ground everyday PERIOD Touring acts are getting booked and received warmly and local labels are putting out good music PERIOD Two notable Portland electronic labels are the Outward Music Company OMCO and Audio Dregs PERIOD

Both are actively working with various styles of electronic music and putting together great shows at local clubs PERIOD Focussing mainly on progressive and experimental Audio Dregs has just released an eclectic compilation called For our Friends and is hosting Audio Dregs Night  this Friday at the FrenchJapanese downtown restaurant Madame Butterfly PERIOD The night includes a live set by Anderegg a local computer artist with a recent release on NYCs Apestaartje label and a DJ set by ERock Audio Dregs owner and electronic buyer for Ozone records PERIOD

Andrregg creates compositions of nervous trembles ticks and spasms all coaxed from acoustic instruments field recordings and all things electronic PERIOD The pieces are then obscured under a wash of sound until he allows glimpses of detail to arise PERIOD

Other Music magazine compared Andereggs compositions to the blurred imagery of

Gerhard Richters paintings from the 70s PERIOD The act of using one sound as a framework to create another is a trail that seems to lead in circles yet results in a masterful effect that not only invites but demands repeat investigation. eRock will play the role of eclectic electronic selector PERIOD He says he doesnt do anything fancy when he DJs these days mainly just selects a varied electronic mix PERIOD I focus music energies into recording these days he said PERIOD

ERock also focuses his energies on some other worthwhile endeavors PERIOD He coruns the Audio Dregs label with his brother EVax and publishes the zine Thumb PERIOD The Audio DregsTomlab compilation For Our Friends features experimental ambient folk and other eclectic sounds from Spain Germany Amsterdam and all around the States PERIOD Maybe ERock will spin a couple cuts on Friday PERIOD

The latest issue of Thumb  contains indepth interviews about music creation with interesting musicians from all around PERIOD Fans and curious newcomers should find most of the interviews entertaining and interesting while musicians will learn a thing or two from the technical talk that occurs PERIOD

ERock says the issue is dedicated to the new digital free thinkers. he says Im interested in people with new sounds and ideas and developing styles that combines avantgarde technique with ideas of pop listenability. hes achieved that goal with Thumb  by seeking out such trendsetters as Mouse on Mars Harald Sack Ziegler and Momus PERIOD

Thumb and Audio Dregs are doing the arts world a service by letting these voices and sounds be heard PERIOD Lump the sounds into whatever sub and subsubsub genre you want to and listen with open ears PERIOD

Your open ears can filled beginning at around  p.m PERIOD this Friday at Madame Butterfly on Fourth and Southwest Stark PERIOD For information on Audio Dregs and Thumb check out www.audiodregs.com PERIOD
