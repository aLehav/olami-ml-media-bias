Americans hold strong feelings about a whole range of athletic divisions conferences and leagues PERIOD None of these sources however engender discussion quite as earnest as the Ivy League PERIOD This may be because most Americans dont realize that their membership in this association is actually all the Ancient Eight universities have in common PERIOD

The actual term Ivy League has entered our national discourse as a synonym for scholarly achievement PERIOD William Deresiewiczs recently published and widely read article Dont Send Your Kid to the Ivy League played into this cultural fixation by lambasting Ivy League universities for failing their historic obligation to teach you to think. the fundamental problem lies not in Ivy League curricula or administration but in the undue attention Americans pay to these few arbitrary institutions PERIOD If we want a real change in educational practice we should examine the places that educate most of our young people community colleges and state universities PERIOD

As a member of one of these underfunded and undiscussed institutions I observe that the problems Deresiewicz identifies with the Ivy League are not too far from those of their public counterparts PERIOD

In his articles and new book Deresiewicz criticizes the Ivy Leagues for their unimaginative criteria for admission and their cultural and academic emphasis on careerism PERIOD He recalls his own time on the Yale admissions board closely scrutinizing the extracurriculars and service trips of each hopeful candidate PERIOD Quoting Ezra Klein a former columnist and blogger for the Washington Post Deresiewicz cites the high proportion of Ivy graduates working in highturnover positions on Wall Street as proof that these universities produce kids who have ample mental horsepower an incredible work ethic and no idea what to do next. deresiewiczs critique is wellplaced and timely PERIOD The priority on career placement within our universities stifles student creativity critical thinking and the selftransformation traditionally associated with a collegiate liberal arts education PERIOD There is something unsettling about his critique though Why does this only pose a problem for the Ivy Leagues

There lies a notsosubtle implication in Deresiewiczs critique that the Ivy Leagues shouldnt be careerfocused because the lessprestigious universities should be PERIOD He cannot resign himself of the elitist Ivyculture even when he criticizes it PERIOD

He laments the lost Ivy culture which produced criticallyminded social reformers PERIOD He maintains the American preoccupation with these universities because they have historically educated the movers and shakers of the country PERIOD When the education at these institutions starts to appear deficient it engenders a special sense of cultural urgency directed at recreating them PERIOD

This and likeminded criticisms of elite education have a ring of circularity to them PERIOD We should be particularly concerned about the education at prestigious private colleges because our culture has always been particularly concerned about them they say PERIOD Even when they dont teach the most talented students and dont provide the best education they still carry a special weight because everyone thinks that they do PERIOD

By focusing our energy on reforming these few universities we are only inflating this already overvalued brand PERIOD In fact our national preoccupation with these best universities in the world masks the dismally underperforming pedagogy at the community colleges and state universities that educate the vast majority of American students PERIOD As Kevin Carey recently wrote in The New York Times we say we have the best universities in the world not to mean that we have the best overall higher education system but that some of the best universities are located within our borders PERIOD

Deresiewiczs advice for students thinking about attending the Ivys becomes quite telling PERIOD He says bluntly Transfer to a public university because the education is often impersonal but the student body is usually genuinely diverse in terms of socioeconomic background with all of the invaluable experiential learning that implies. as a student at one of those still very good public universities this allows me to say two things PERIOD First that impersonal education is not an unfortunate sidenote but the defining characteristic of an underfunded and ineffective system of public higher education and needs to be forcefully addressed by state and federal legislators PERIOD We should be reconsidering how that education can become more personal transformative and critical rather than resigning ourselves to an uncreative pedagogy and experiential learning. if Deresiewicz is concerned about Ivy League students not feeling sufficiently challenged in their seminars then he should consider a 400person introductory lecture at a state school or community college before making any recommendations PERIOD

Second state universities still do not represent the racial or socioeconomic makeup of our nation PERIOD The suggestion that overwhelmingly wealthy prospectiveIvyLeaguers come to public schools on some sort of Grand Tour of marginalized demographics makes little sense and obscures the deficiencies of these educational institutions that typically do serve lowincome students PERIOD

Deresiewicz and other critics of elite education provide incisive and sobering insight but their insight is needed most urgently elsewhere PERIOD They would do well to redirect their attention and the nations to less Ivystrewn walls PERIOD
