Gettysburg Football got off on the right foot on Saturday when they beat the Juniata Eagles by  points in a strong performance PERIOD The Bullets punished the Eagles for leaving the Centennial Conference as they attacked them with a strong balanced rushing and passing attack PERIOD

The Bullets gained  yards on the ground while quarterback Rocco Abdinoor  threw for  yards and two touchdowns PERIOD The sophomore earned Centennial Conference Offensive Player of the Week honors after the victory against the Eagles PERIOD Gettysburg now has six straight wins against Juniata one of the inaugural members of the new Landmark Conference PERIOD

Gettysburg put together a nice first quarter holding a  advantage as Abdinoor hit key passes to set up two drives that resulted in a field goal and touchdown respectively PERIOD Juniata responded with a score after a Bullet turnover but wide receiver Walle Harwigsson Lundblad  snatched the momentum from the talons of the Eagles PERIOD He returned the ensuing kickoff  yards to the house in a gamechanging play PERIOD Lundblad earned Centennial Conference Special Teams Player of the Week honors deservingly as the Sweden native returned three kickoffs for  yards and added five grabs for another  PERIOD Certainly the Bullets would have no problem if Lundblad could break out and perhaps be a nice compliment to wideout Ryan McAndrew  PERIOD McAndrew was the Bullets leading receiver last season PERIOD

However Juniata would not go quietly driving  yards to make it a threepoint game before the half PERIOD It was uncertain how this Bullet team would respond as now the Eagles finally grasped momentum heading into the lockerroom no doubt with the thought of breaking their sixgame losing streak to their old Centennial Conference foes PERIOD It would certainly be sweet to come into Gettysburg on opening weekend and spoil the fun in the form of an upset PERIOD Gettysburg however would not be denied PERIOD

Abdinoor responded with an impressive 75yard drive highlighted by some key third down conversions and extended the Gettysburg lead to  on a pass to James McCarren  PERIOD The Bullets nearly made it  but a long touchdown run by Abdinoor was waived off on an illegal blindside block much to the dismay of the Bullet faithful in the stands and Gettysburg settled for a field goal PERIOD The teams traded scores with Gettysburg scoring immediately after a nice puntreturn by Luke Denison  and a 28yard toss from Abdinoor to McCarren PERIOD However Abdinoor put the nail in the coffin with a drive headlined by several nice runs including a 41yard scamper that showed his true dual threat ability PERIOD

Abdinoor showed prowess on the ground during his freshman year and his improvements through the air were on display Saturday PERIOD He is a weapon that could prove to be lethal to Centennial Conference defenses as the emergence of the passing game could open up even more of a ground game for the Bullets PERIOD Abdinoor commented on earning the CC honors as he admitted that it felt great to be recognized by the conference but it is a team game.Abdinoor praised his teammates pointing to the blood sweat and tears that he and his teammates have put in in the offseason PERIOD

Abdinoor invoked a mantra heralded by another Pennsylvania college football program insisting that his team is focused on going  and  every play every day. gettysburg will take on Montclair State on Saturday September ninth in the teams first ever matchup as Abdinoor and the Bullets look to build on their strong performance PERIOD
