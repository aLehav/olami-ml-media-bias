4061,2023-11-03,"fresno State is in its final season in the Western Athletic Conference and the Dogs have freefallen from being a preseason contender for the title to losing to a WAC opponent the program has never succumbed to PERIOD

After suffering losses to three straight WAC opponents the Dogs are looking change the mentality of the team PERIOD

Head coach Pat Hill emphasized how poor execution has plagued the Bulldogs this season and he is planning on using the remainder of  to focus on improving Fresno State from within rather than worrying about who the next opponent is PERIOD

Fresno State has been on a recent threegame losing streak where it came up short against conference opponents Nevada Louisiana Tech and New Mexico State PERIOD Hill has seen the decline in the Fresno States play from the beginning of the season to the present PERIOD

Against Louisiana Tech we didnt play with the type of execution we played with earlier in the season Hill said PERIOD Were going to get back to working on the fundamentals. after the loss to Louisiana Tech the Dogs needed to win their final four games to become bowl eligible PERIOD The first team on the schedule was New Mexico State who had never defeated Fresno State PERIOD The Aggies got their first win against the Dogs in a highscoring affair  PERIOD

If we get better at our fundamentals and we get better at teaching what we do and not worry about the other people so much I hope we can get better as a football team Hill said PERIOD I still have great belief and confidence that this team can finish strong. the offense hasnt provided much of the problem during the recent losing streak as the Dogs had  yards of total offense with sophomore quarterback Derek Carr throwing for a careerhigh  yards and three touchdowns PERIOD

Certain ingame situations have dictated where Fresno States focus will be regarding the offensive side of the ball PERIOD Throughout the season it has seemed like the Dogs have run the ball a lot but in reality they have only run the ball  more times than they have passed the ball PERIOD Carr talked about it not mattering whether or not the offense is unbalanced as long as Fresno State gets the victory PERIOD

Its the same whatever it takes to win Carr said PERIOD If its running the ball or throwing the ball me and Robbie feel comfortable doing both. the offense has tried to follow the same balanced approach of allowing an even amount of passing plays and running plays PERIOD

Running back Robbie Rouse has had at least  rushing attempts in eight of the  games this year and has run for at least two rushing touchdowns on three different occasions this year PERIOD

Throughout the season the Bulldog offense has shown flashes of brilliance scoring at least  points in all but one game in  PERIOD

Although the offense is putting points on the board it has only turned into three wins two of which have come from teams with losing records while the third belongs to a team that currently plays in the Football Championship Subdivision PERIOD

Despite the consistency of the offense the team has lacked the same explosiveness that it had last year when it put up more than  points six times PERIOD This year the Bulldogs have reached the 30point mark only three times so far PERIOD Passing game coordinator Jeff Grady recognizes that Fresno State needs to put up more points to have a chance to get more wins especially with the defensive struggles PERIOD

We definitely need to put more points on the board Grady said PERIOD We need to be more efficient. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
