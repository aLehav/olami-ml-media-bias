4155,2007-06-07,"over the course of this school year Ive seen nearly  UCSB sporting events PERIOD Ive watched Gauchos in action in cities ranging from Dallas Texas to Norfolk Va. and Ive heard versions of the national anthem that make Borats rendition seem reasonable PERIOD Throughout it all though one moment sticks out above the rest PERIOD It occurred in a postgame press conference in St PERIOD Louis just minutes after the soccer team captured the schools second national championship PERIOD As Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg addressed the media sophomore Nick Perera passed his phone around the stage showing a photo of the fans back in Isla Vista celebrating on the beach PERIOD But on a campus where beer pong often overshadows college athletics can that moment ever be recaptured My hope is that it can and with the book about to be closed on another year of Gaucho athletics this is the perfect time to look at what the future might hold PERIOD

Ill start with the champs because quite frankly theyve earned the right to top any list involving UCSB sports for years to come PERIOD Despite losing four key players on the field next years roster might be the most talented in school history PERIOD Ciaran OBrien  the countrys top transfer  is expected to fill the void left by Tyler Rosenlunds departure while Eric Avila will move outside to replace the sincedrafted Bryan Byrne PERIOD With the continued development of players like Perera Bongomin Otii Chris Pontius and Alfonso Motagalvan the team should have more than enough talent to compete with anyone in the country PERIOD The lone question mark for now is in goal where Bryant Rueckner is expected to pick up where Kyle Reynish left off PERIOD If he can do so the Gauchos appear poised to make another run at a title PERIOD One problem that the team does need to watch out for is the fact that every opponent will circle the UCSB game on their calendar PERIOD Like it or not the Gauchos are a marked team but anyone who knows Coach Vom Steeg knows that he probably wont have any difficulty motivating his players PERIOD On an individual note keep an eye on Avila and Andy Iro as both should be in the running for national player of the year honors PERIOD

Moving over to the hardwood theres no doubt that its Big West Titleorbust time for both the mens and womens basketball teams PERIOD The men should go into the year as conference favorites and anything short of a trip to the Big Dance would be sorely disappointing PERIOD Transfer Nedim Pajevic should provide a huge boost on the floor as well as in the stands as fans and announcers alike find new ways to pronounce his name incorrectly PERIOD Next season will also provide a rarity for Gaucho fans as Alex Harris will have a legitimate shot at playing his way into the NBA draft PERIOD Keep an eye on Harris on the floor but dont forget to check out press row to get a headcount of the scouts in attendance PERIOD

The womens team finds itself in a peculiar situation as virtually everyone in the conference knows the way the season will play out PERIOD Barring some sort of disaster UCSB and UC Riverside will be far and away the best teams in the league and both should cruise to the Big West Tournament finale PERIOD The question now becomes whether or not Head Coach Mark French Jenna Green Jessica Wilson and the rest of the Gauchos can get over the hump and end the Highlanders twoyear run at the top PERIOD Also watch for French and his team to attack its nonconference schedule as this might be the rare season when the conference earns two bids to the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

Aside from the bigtime sports several other teams on campus should be on the rise but thats a topic for another column PERIOD For now go off and enjoy your summer break but dont forget to show up in early September to serenade the champs with those famous chants of Soccer School USA. print
