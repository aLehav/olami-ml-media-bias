Sunday March  saw a ranked matchup between the No PERIOD  Texas AM and the No PERIOD  Georgia womens tennis teams PERIOD The two teams had a combined record of  heading into the weekend bout adding up for a perfect  in SEC play PERIOD

The Aggies and Bulldogs were in singles play and Court  was a backandforth affair the last of the courts standing PERIOD AM freshman No PERIOD  Mary Stoiana faced Georgia freshman No PERIOD  Dasha Vidmanova PERIOD

With hundreds of fans in attendance in Athens Ga. cheering on the home teams Vidmanova as she battled in a thirdset with Stoiana the Bulldog ended up falling to the Aggie by a score of    PERIOD

The match was over and the Aggies won  a  sweep against the No PERIOD  team in the nation PERIOD

Its a pretty impressive performance by our group here PERIOD My guess is that a result like that hasnt happened at the University of Georgia in quite some time if it has ever happened at all AM coach Mark Weaver said PERIOD They had a huge crowd out and we did a really great job of embracing their crowd PERIOD Beating them  is truly unheard of. the Aggies keep stacking wins rising to a historic record of   in conference and the best start in program history PERIOD

We are definitely making some history here and there have been a ton of highlights already this season Weaver said PERIOD Our motto all season has been to continue getting better and better each day PERIOD That mindset showed itself today and it will remain our motto for the remainder of the regular season. the Bulldogs who fell to   in SEC play werent just a good allaround team they had a lineup stacked with ranked athletes PERIOD

In doubles play AMs No PERIOD  duo of senior Tatiana Makarova and junior Jayci Goldsmith took down Georgias No PERIOD  duo of graduate Morgan Coppoc and junior Ania Hertel PERIOD As well AMs No PERIOD  duo of Stoiana and junior Carson Branstine took down Georgias No PERIOD  duo of Vidmanova and freshman Mell Reasco PERIOD

In singles play Georgia had a ranked player on five of the six courts  No PERIOD  junior Lea Ma No PERIOD  Reasco No PERIOD  Vidmanova No PERIOD  Meg Kowalski and No PERIOD  Hertel PERIOD

The Bulldogs marked the fifth team that was ranked at match time to play against Aggies this season all of which have been in the top  and three of which have been top  PERIOD The Bulldogs were the highest ranked team the Aggies have beaten this season their previous best win having come versus thenNo PERIOD  USC and the lone loss coming versus thenNo PERIOD  California PERIOD

I think one of the big things that we emphasized after the Tennessee match on Friday March  we spoke a lot about developing a championship mindset Weaver said PERIOD I truly believe that we played like champions out there today PERIOD We rose to the occasion PERIOD Were still in basketball season around here and the analogy I shared with the team was that each player should want to be the person taking the gamewinning shot not the person passing it off to someone else PERIOD That was a big part of our mindset today and it really paid off. aM has five matches remaining before the postseason begins with the SEC Tournament from April  PERIOD The Aggies final five games all come against conference competition the next being a home matchup against Auburn on Friday April  at  p.m PERIOD
