About  people met at the intersection of Main Street and Penn Avenue in Bloomfield Friday evening to show support for black and trans women PERIOD

By  Carolyn Brodie For The Pitt News October  

In the weeks following the release of a Pitt report which said black residents experience a lower quality of life in Pittsburgh than in other cities multiple incidents of apparent violence against black women in Pittsburgh have seemed to underscore the studys point PERIOD

First two black women were assaulted at an ExxonMobil gas station on the North Side by the stations owner and employees PERIOD Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala charged the three men involved with simple assault in late September  charges many say are too lenient PERIOD

Then reports started to circulate that Elisha Stanley  a black trans woman whose body was found in downtown Pittsburgh on Sept PERIOD   had been the victim of foul play PERIOD

About  protesters met at the intersection of Main Street and Penn Avenue in Bloomfield on Friday evening fed up and demanding change PERIOD They marched across the neighborhood chanting and wielding signs to show support for black and trans women demand the recall of Zappala and encourage the elimination of gentrification in Pittsburgh PERIOD Some protesters signs read Black Trans Femme Women Womyn NonBinary UsToo and Respect and Protect Black Women. local black activists organized the Protect Black Women March  Protest which was promoted on Facebook in response to larger systemic issues of discrimination as well as three recent incidents in particular  Stanleys death the ExxonMobil attack and a recent report by Pitt researchers PERIOD

The report named Pittsburgh as the least livable city in the United States for black people citing high maternal mortality rates homicide rates and occupational inequalities PERIOD

Jalissia Haynes a senior studying politics and philosophy and one of Fridays protesters said Stanleys death was further proof of the Pitt studys findings PERIOD

Dont make us move PERIOD We dont want to move Haynes said PERIOD Make this City livable for us. haynes said she thinks it is important for the Pitt community to rally around the black community after the publication of the report PERIOD

Following the march participants gathered in the street at the intersection Penn Avenue and South Winebiddle Street to light candles for black trans women killed across the United States and for black women murdered in Pittsburgh PERIOD There organizers of the protest read from demands listed on a large scroll of paper PERIOD

Their demands included that the City of Pittsburgh take the same initiative that Black women and girls are taking in regards to the race and gender equity report that the DA charge the men responsible for the ExxonMobil attack with aggravated assault and that all assaults against black women be fully investigated and prosecuted PERIOD Organizers also demanded that black women be involved in discussions agendas and decisions that directly impact them PERIOD

Local State Rep PERIOD Sara Innamorato marched with the protesters holding a sign that read A Black trans woman was killed in Pittsburgh PERIOD Elisha Stanley Say her name ProtectBlackWomen. stanleys death was something that really didnt get very much press and that is common when there is a trans person especially a black trans woman who is the victim Innamorato said PERIOD

Jordan Fields a Pitt senior studying political science said she came to the march to show support for the black and trans communities PERIOD

As a black woman after watching the video at the ExxonMobil I wanted to come out to march and support other black women trans women and femaleidentifying persons because I know how hard it can be to exist in some of these communities Fields said PERIOD

Fields said she believes that allies can do their part to be supportive of black trans and femme communities PERIOD
