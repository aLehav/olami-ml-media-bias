7660,1970-01-01,"the time had finally arrived PERIOD

Freshman Carolyn Ganes was about to step onto McArthur Court in front of thousands of screaming fans for the first time PERIOD

Her nervousness had reached a climax but she was ready PERIOD All the anticipation had led up to this point PERIOD

But something was wrong PERIOD

I was like oh my gosh my dad is not here to give me the talk Ganes said PERIOD I had to borrow Dans assistant coach Dan Muscatell cell phone PERIOD I had to call my dad before the game. its a ritual for the Ganes family PERIOD Through all her years of playing since the fourth grade Ganes needed that comfort from her father Roger Ganes and her usual pep talk PERIOD

Even though Ganes knows the exact words she said its just not the same without hearing them from her father PERIOD

Carolyn just go out and play hard cause that is all you can do Ganes said imitating her father PERIOD Make sure you play defense and rebound the ball. and that is how it all began PERIOD For Ganes her first experience in The Pit was an unforgettable moment PERIOD

The fans were all cheering and the band was playing Ganes said PERIOD I was like oh my gosh this is amazing because I had never experienced anything like that  where people are so into the games. these are praises coming from someone who has quite the track record considering shes only  years old PERIOD Ganes played two years for the Canadian junior national team where she met fellow Oregon teammate Yadili Okwumabua also a freshman PERIOD Ganes was the youngest member of the Canadian national team in summer  PERIOD

And now she brings her 6foot3inch presence to the post for Oregon PERIOD Through her beginning months as a Duck Ganes has made her presence known and is continuing to become a dominating force PERIOD

The Saskatoon Saskatchewan native continues to put up solid numbers for the Ducks and through the teams adversity holds a starting position PERIOD

Ganes leads Oregon in scoring averaging . points per game ranking her twelfth in the Pac10 and she is bringing down four rebounds per game PERIOD

She also shows her poise from the charity line as Ganes ranks third in the conference with a . percentage from the freethrow line PERIOD

More than anything it is her

determination and ambition that I think are very important Oregon head coach Bev Smith said PERIOD Her basketballplaying ability is very good and it is because of those two qualities. fellow teammate and roommate Okwumabua has had the chance to become good friends with Ganes and watch her game grow over time PERIOD

She has a really beautiful shot Okwumabua said PERIOD She is getting better every day and she just has the ability to pound people on the inside PERIOD She has only good stuff to come and her whole game has been developing. ganes knows that there is still room for improvement and despite her success thus far it hasnt been an easy road to travel PERIOD

She finished her high school career as a fouryear letterwinner and helped lead her team to a  record and the Saskatchewan Class 4A provincial championship PERIOD

Ganes move from Canada to Oregon has required adjustments but has been enjoyable and interesting for her from culture to basketball PERIOD

Americans are so outspoken and they will just tell you exactly what is on their mind Ganes said PERIOD I love it down here and of all the places I have been in the States Oregon is the most like Canada. yet despite being from out of town Ganes brings a familiar presence to the team PERIOD She fits in well and her style and attitude resemble Oregons center from the  season PERIOD

Everybody says I remind them of Jenny Mowe Ganes said PERIOD

Ganes has her own individual characteristics though and her own nickname PERIOD Around the dorms and the locker room Ganes is known as Big Red because on occasions of nervousness or embarrassment her face turns beet red PERIOD

Through all the experiences and the redness Ganes says she is having a blast and feels very much at home here at Oregon PERIOD If Ganes can continue her scoring spree she will set the highest average for an Oregon freshman since the  season PERIOD

And Ganes is well on her way given that she has scored in double figures in five straight games and eight of the past nine PERIOD But she has quite the distance to set Oregons alltime average for a freshman . points per game held by head coach Smith PERIOD

Ganes quest continues tonight as Oregon faces off with Arizona State   Pac10 PERIOD Even though the Sun Devils have won the last four of the series the Ducks have confidence being at home tonight PERIOD

They have controlled us over the past couple of years but now is our opportunity to make a difference Smith said PERIOD If we play better defensively we have a very good chance PERIOD Arizona State says they love playing here and we are going to have to change that statement a little bit. contact the sports reporter
