Penn State alumnus Michael Hashin is a dedicated fan PERIOD

He has been to every home football game since  and says hes seen the best and the worst of games and tailgating festivities PERIOD He donates annually to Penn State athletics for his prime parking spot and seating for the game PERIOD

But that little extra bang for his buck has not come this year as wins have been few PERIOD

If the fall continues he says there is a possibility he would stop coming to games and halt his donations PERIOD However that possibility is slight PERIOD

 he said 

This trend has put some Penn State officials slightly on edge as the funding problems seen across the country begin to loom on the horizon for Penn State PERIOD

But for now officials and fans credit the strong traditions of alumni giving and corporate sponsorship for the fact that athletic funding has not immediately followed the football teams abrupt decline into the cellar this decade PERIOD

After  years of winning in football most do not expect support to wane any time soon PERIOD Recent studies fundraising trends corporate commitments and fans continuing to flow into parking lots with beer and sandwiches in tow all indicate that the support should continue into the near future PERIOD

And Penn State remains one of the more stable athletic departments in the country  although better is of course less than ideal PERIOD

Penn States athletic department is unique in that the university does not allocate money to athletics from its general operating funds said John Nichols Penn States representative on the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics COIA an organization of university leaders aiming to keep sports from harming academics PERIOD

The athletic department is financially selfsupporting which means that money donated to the athletic department does not go to support academics  and vice versa PERIOD

Penn State is one of the few Big Ten schools that does not use general funds to support athletics Nichols said PERIOD

In March the University Faculty Senate became a part of the COIA with hopes of keeping the athletic program financially independent PERIOD

The COIA a national organization of university faculty senate leaders committed to reducing spending on intercollegiate athletics and helping to facilitate longterm reforms to the current system is helping to address these issues PERIOD

Currently eight Big Ten schools are members PERIOD The COIA now consists of  faculty senates at Division I schools Nichols said PERIOD

While some are still questioning the permanent effect of a losing football season on donations a national survey indicates that changes would be unlikely PERIOD

A study conducted in May by the James S PERIOD and James L PERIOD Knight Foundation concluded that 

The study also found that success of bigname sports does not affect the academic quality of the schools applicants PERIOD

While Nichols contends it is a myth that the university as a whole would see fewer donations because of a losing football record he said it is possible that private and corporate support of athletic programs could be affected PERIOD

However Nichols said while a losing football record may frustrate some donors he doubts the record would have any longterm effects on outside funding PERIOD

Currently major revenue lines secured by Hashin other alumni and corporations seem to be safe PERIOD

Donations through the Nittany Lion Club an organization that supports athletic programs have remained fairly constant during the last three years John Powell associate athletic director for marketing and development said PERIOD

He added that private donations make up about  to  percent of total incoming funds to the athletic department PERIOD

Powell said the numbers have recently remained constant but often fluctuate from year to year depending on the size of the gifts PERIOD

The Nittany Lion Club provides financial support to about  student athletes and  sports including  mens and  womens teams PERIOD

Powell said a minimal decrease in overall private athletic donations was due to the end of the Grand Destiny Campaign a sevenyear universitywide effort to raise . billion that ended in  PERIOD

Corporate support of the athletic program has seen a slight improvement during the last three years Powell said PERIOD

Peter Weiler associate vice president for development and alumni relations said he does not expect to see any immediate or longterm effects on corporate donations to athletics resulting from the losing record because games have still been fairly wellattended PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

MBNA Corporation has had a 15year relationship with Penn State and it has made a point to donate to both the universitys athletic and academic programs said Jim Donohue spokesman for MBNA PERIOD

Donohue said the company gives money to the athletic department because of its close relationship with Penn State graduates PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

He added that football games are a great way to not only market to alumni but to students parents administration and staff as well PERIOD

Donohue said the corporation works closely with the administration to determine where funds are most needed PERIOD

A series of lessthandesirable football seasons would have no effect on how much or to where the donations will be directed he said PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Donohue added that the corporation has had a reciprocal relationship with the academic side PERIOD The company gives money to academia and in return has found it beneficial to hire more than  Penn State graduates he said PERIOD

The fourthlargest donor to sports programs last year was the Penn State Alumni Association Weiler said PERIOD

The sponsorship is more evidence of the important financial link between Penn State graduates and support of sports programs PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

But the continued support still does not mean that athletic coffers are stellar PERIOD

Officials in the athletic department are finding ways to enhance this close connection as financial burdens in the department persist PERIOD

In October the athletic department embarked on a  million fundraising campaign with hopes of sustaining private and corporate donors and keeping the athletic department selfsupported PERIOD

The campaign will primarily raise money for athletic scholarships PERIOD Financial support for athletes has been an increasing burden on the budget as tuition continues to rise Powell said PERIOD

Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley said increased travel personnel and medical coverage expenses coupled with the costs of rising tuition continue to be burdens on the budget of Penn States athletic department PERIOD

However the problems arent bad enough that the department will have to make any grave changes he said PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Curley said he was unsure of where funding cuts would be made in a situation where belttightening initiatives would need to be made PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

He cited cutting back athletic programming support staff or dipping into general funds as possible choices for regaining revenue PERIOD

However now that the fundraising campaign has begun hopefully these changes wont be necessary Curley said PERIOD

The fund raising will allocate money for sports facilities such as a new baseball stadium wrestling complex softball stadium golf clubhouse and indoor tennis complex PERIOD

Powell said that while some are quick to criticize the department for making lavish improvements in a time of financial hardships the criticism is unjustified PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Curley said it is essential to keep Penn State facilities comparable to those in the Big Ten because of recruitment PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

However the proposed improvements need to be completed because the facilities are obsolete Curley said PERIOD

Rec Hall which currently houses the training and practice facilities for the wrestling team is currently under renovation PERIOD It was built in  and lacks the proper equipment needed for training Powell said PERIOD

Constructed in  the indoor tennis building is also in need of renovation Curley said PERIOD

The current structure only has four tennis courts and six are needed to compete in a Big Ten match he said PERIOD

 Powell said PERIOD 

Some in the movement say there is no denying that a financial arms race exists in athletics PERIOD

They say that spending on major sports at universities is skyrocketing and that the competition between schools is taking place in an increasingly commercialized way PERIOD

Curley said there is a certain competition to spending money on athletic programs but that this is the same competition that takes place with the update of academic buildings PERIOD

Penn States membership in COIA is evidence that the university is attempting to counteract such pressures PERIOD

Currently the COIA is concerned with creating a draft policy on academic integrity Nichols said PERIOD

Officials will meet in January to discuss issues related to keeping universities academically oriented PERIOD

Nichols said Penn States system is one of the best out of all schools represented in the COIA PERIOD

The fact that the universitys athletic department is selfsupporting helps keep academic issues separate from athletic ones PERIOD Additionally academic advising is not part of the athletic department as it is as other schools he said PERIOD

Keeping commercialism out of college sports has been a longtime goal of the COIA PERIOD

It has also remained important at Penn State Powell said and the goal remains increasingly imperative as corporate sponsorships of athletic programs multiply PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Corporate sponsors have a choice of donating   or  per year as part of an advertising package that gives them signs in Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center PERIOD

However care is taken to make sure the advertising is not pervasive and does not turn the venues into commercial conglomerates PERIOD

Curley said he is fairly confident that the fundraising campaign will do its job so cuts wont have to be made PERIOD

 he said PERIOD
