5963,2023-07-11,"at the far end of the Forty Acres the Fine Arts Library FAL is to most students an unvisited nomans land PERIOD To others the FAL is crucial to their everyday college experience PERIOD In this community space students interact with book collections congregate in study rooms and create works of art in pursuit of becomingbetter academics PERIOD

While the FAL provides opportunities to many students the ongoing relocation of its books to offcampus locations has also affected student experiences PERIOD These two aspects of the FAL have varying impacts on students who utilize the study space regularly PERIOD Raul Facundo Gomez vocal performance senior said that his best FAL experience was witnessing musicstudents research presentations PERIOD

On the first floor the students had sections and booths to talk about their projects Facundo Gomez said PERIOD It gave me a new perspective on music PERIOD Those kinds of events show that music students arent just always reading books PERIOD Theyre also writing papers writing in journals and discussing topics. zoe Cagan music performance junior said the FALs view of the tower provided her with her most cherished and abstract memory PERIOD

One day I looked out the window as the sun was setting right over the tower and it was one of the coolest things Ive ever seen Cagan said PERIOD I felt inundated with what I was studying and it shined the light on why I was there at UT PERIOD I just remember being in that library seeing all of this andrealizing how I was trying to change the world. to make way for the new arts and entertainment technologies major UTs College of Fine Arts COFA website reports that approximately  percent of their collection has been moved offcampus PERIOD Isabella Luna vocal music studies freshman said the FALs shrinking book collection is her stress reliever. whenever Im really stressed I go to the fifth floor of the FAL and just look at all the books Luna said PERIOD I was one of those kids who always read so Im very comforted by libraries like this. luna also said in comparison to other libraries on campus she feels more welcome at the FAL PERIOD

The FAL is a safe spot for fine arts majors Luna said PERIOD If I were to pull out a score and start analyzing it at the PCL Im sure I would get a few weird looks PERIOD Here its completely normal. these ongoing changes to the FAL have altered some students everyday experiences PERIOD For example Cagan said her worst memory of the FAL  being unable to locate a needed resource for class  is
related to this change PERIOD

This resource was so basic that I was surprised that our library didnt have it Cagan said PERIOD I was frustrated because I thought How am I supposed to study this piece get better knowledge and be an educated musician if this basicresource is not here

Facundo Gomez said the introduction of new technology hasimpacted his FAL experiences PERIOD

They brought these 3D printing machines to replace what used to be study spaces and books Facundo Gomez said PERIOD These machines are very loud and theyaffect the way I study. cagan said she worries about how changes to the FAL will affect future COFA studentscollege experiences PERIOD

Though I care so much about this library I feel that UT22 UT23 and everyone behind them wont care because there will be nothing for them to care about Cagan said PERIOD We know that therell probably not be much of a change while were here but if future students who have a love for the fine arts or want to become a new person in that sense dont have these opportunities everything will be for nothing. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Fine arts students recall memories made at Fine Arts Library â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
