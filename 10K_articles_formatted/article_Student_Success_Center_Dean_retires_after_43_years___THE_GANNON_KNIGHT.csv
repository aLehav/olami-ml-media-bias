A Gannon University alumnus Ward McCracken understood the best interest of students as an employee PERIOD McCracken retired from his position as dean of the Student Success Center when the  school year wrapped up PERIOD

Before working in the Student Success Center he was a resident assistant for two years as a student and the resident director of Wehrle Hall while he worked to obtain a masters degree in counseling. mcCracken worked with the Registrars Office beginning in  and said he witnessed the administrative systems converting from paper to digital systems PERIOD

Later he worked as the vice president of Student Development starting in  until his title was changed to the dean of Student Development. mcCracken was among the universitys administrators who worked on campus renovations like improvements to the cafeteria and building Waldron Campus Center PERIOD

He also worked to improve student organizations by making the Student Government Association SGA and the Activities Programming Board APB separate groups PERIOD

McCracken served as an adviser to the staff of The Gannon Knight  the universitys studentproduced weekly newspaper  during his time as dean working with the editors and business managers PERIOD Student Activities was renamed as Student Organizations and Leadership Development at his suggestion PERIOD

The thought was that it was more about leadership than just the activities it provided students McCracken said PERIOD

McCracken oversaw the job requirements for resident directors become more rigorous as the position went from hiring graduate students to a fulltime job that required a masters degree. he thought of students who dont live on campus when he organized the Commuter Life Department after the approval of thenProvost Thomas S PERIOD Ostrowski Ph PERIOD D PERIOD

McCracken also played a role in the upgrade to the Counseling Office and the additions to the Recreation and Wellness Center PERIOD

The Counseling office was one masterslevel counselor and I am very proud that I was able to convince the administration that we needed a fulltime psychologist McCracken said. he said he was able to talk the administration into adding two more psychologists before he left his position PERIOD

I feel that serving the students was what kept me at Gannon for all of those years said McCracken who retired with  years of service to the university PERIOD

I am leaving a lot of good friends behind and I had the pleasure of working with a lot of the great people who sacrificed to make Gannon what it is today. he added that his reason for retirement was fueled by the desire to spend time with his family and traveling. now he is revisiting his honeymoon destination with his wife PERIOD

It is time to let the next generation of young administrators take control and make Gannon even a better place for students McCracken said PERIOD

I know I am leaving Gannon in good hands. kELSEY GHERING
