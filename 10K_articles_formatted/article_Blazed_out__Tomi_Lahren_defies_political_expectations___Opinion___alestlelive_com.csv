Tomi Lahren a conservative political pundit was let go from TheBlazeafter stating the government should not decide whether or not a woman can choose to get an abortion PERIOD

Lahren commented on her abortion views on March  at an interview with the hosts of The View PERIOD

Im prochoice and heres why I cant sit here and be a hypocrite and say Im for limited government but I think that the government should decide what women should do with their bodies Lahren said PERIOD

Also Lahren said You know what Im for limited government so stay out of my guns and you can stay out of my body as well. because of this comment Lahrens show Tomi was permanently suspended after speaking her political view  one that doesnt line up with the views of her audience PERIOD

This very incident goes to show the importance we hold on labels especially political ones PERIOD

Someone either has to be liberal or conservative and if all their beliefs dont line up with one or the other they receive harsh backlash PERIOD

Let it be noted that this criticism doesnt just come from the conservative side liberals are guilty of it too PERIOD

Contributor to the Huffington Post Chad Felix Greene wrote a piece last June about how he is gay and holds conservative viewpoints PERIOD In his article he speaks about how some liberals just dont understand how he can have liberal and conservative viewpoints PERIOD

To be sure there is a gay left and a gay right. we have for far too long placed our collective identity into a very narrow slot and have considered deviation to be inherently flawed. people and often other gay people ask me frequently how I can support a political position that is opposed to everything I am as a person Greene said PERIOD

Another example would be the criticism of Christians or religious people in general who feel their religion shouldnt dictate other peoples lives

In all these situations people receive unneeded feedback by their political or religious affiliations PERIOD However it is time we all take a stand especially as students to put an end to this title nonsense PERIOD

We speak about diversity and inclusion at SIUE but when one person holds mixed political views we dont know where to place them when we shouldnt be trying to place them anywhere PERIOD
