4010,2021-03-13,"fresno State launched a fund drive and a plan to establish an endowment for the universitys Dream Outreach and Success Program on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

The program is designed to help undocumented students enter Fresno State and succeed during their time here PERIOD

Basically it is a pathway to success for undocumented students said David Hembree development director for student affairs PERIOD There are a number of nuances as far as who those folks are in the category of Dreamers that covers all the undocumented students that are trying to access higher education at Fresno State. the fund drive was organized so the school can ensure that the center can provide the services needed to a growing pool of undocumented students entering Fresno State PERIOD

In the fall of  there were over  students in the program Hembree said PERIOD Currently we have over  students who have applied to Fresno State for the fall of  PERIOD

So its growing incrementally  certainly the need is growing I think those numbers will continue to grow. the university has set up several levels at which supporters can pledge their contributions that range from  to  PERIOD Additionally Hembree said an endowment fund would be established at pledges of  or by donating a smaller amount that is instructed to go toward the endowment fund PERIOD

The program is split into two components the Dream Outreach Center and the Dream Success Center which is different from most other universities said Raul Moreno coordinator of the outreach center PERIOD

The Dream Outreach Center is the part of the program that works on access and opportunity Hembree said PERIOD It will provide outreach to unenrolled students interested in pursuing higher education and help them navigate the path of enrolling into Fresno State under the DREAM Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act PERIOD

The California DREAM Act is a package of state laws that allow children who were brought into the U.S PERIOD illegally under the age of  who have met certain school attendance and GPA requirements the right to apply for instate tuition and stateadministered financial aid PERIOD

Hembree said the outreach center hopes to convey to these students that their dreams can come true. the Dream Center deals with students who are already enrolled at Fresno State PERIOD The success center will support advise and counsel  even along the lines of career counseling  students once they arrive at Fresno State. any students meeting the eligibility of the DREAM Act are eligible should they want to enroll in the program PERIOD

Sometimes there is a reluctance among Dreamers to ask for help because of their undocumented status Hembree said PERIOD

While many of the services offered through the Dream Center are available through other means Hembree said undocumented students have unique challenges that require staff with specific training and knowledge PERIOD

Taking into account immigration documentation and citizenship status and navigating the financial aid and resources that are available for them as undocumented students PERIOD Thats all fairly complicated and outside of the realm of what normal advising services at Fresno State do Hembree said PERIOD Student affairs and Fresno State are all focused on student success and this is just another way that we are identifying specific students and creating opportunity and access. the Outreach Center connects students with outside agencies and even helps them deal with immigration PERIOD

Moreno stressed that students applying under the DREAM Act were not looking for special treatment PERIOD

DREAM students are regularly admissible students meaning they meet every single standard the university has in place to be admitted Moreno said PERIOD They are not looking for a free ride PERIOD They are willing to work PERIOD They are willing to do the job PERIOD They are simply looking for an opportunity. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
