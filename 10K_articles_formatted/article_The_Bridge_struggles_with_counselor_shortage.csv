5281,2018-10-19,"the Bridge Peer Counseling Center known colloquially as the Bridge is facing a shortage of student counselors PERIOD Bridge staff members are working to improve the organizations attraction and retention of counselors through increased advertising and community building PERIOD

The studentvolunteerrun peer counseling center open  is a mental health resource dedicated to providing free and confidential support to students PERIOD The Bridge operates out of the Rogers House on Capistrano Way PERIOD

According to Bridge livein counselor Devon Burger  the counseling center has typically had an excess of counselors willing to take shifts but turnout has dropped off in the  academic year PERIOD

We had a few shifts that were open at the beginning of the quarter Burger said PERIOD

Amanda Spyropoulos  another livein member said the number of counselors at the Bridge for the start of each quarter has typically hovered in the thirties but the number was sixteen this year PERIOD

In an effort to help mitigate its staff shortage the Bridge has been reaching out to past counselors to take open shifts PERIOD Current members have been supplementing the shortage with livein counselors taking on a large share of the hours PERIOD

We sort of reached out to past counselors and were like Hey Do you want to take some shifts And a lot of people did Burger said PERIOD

By week two the Bridge had  staffers signed up PERIOD

Spyropoulos linked possible staff shortages to insufficient advertising or knowledge of the Bridge especially during the first few weeks of New Student Orientation NSO during which there is a large number of club signups PERIOD

We had an open house at the Bridge during NSO Spyropoulos said PERIOD Only about  people showed up. according to Burger the absence of  graduates from the Bridge community may have contributed to the staffing shortage PERIOD

We had a lot of seniors graduate Burger said PERIOD And then because its fall quarter freshmen arent eligible to start staffing yet  It definitely limits who is available to staff. in order to become eligible to serve at the Bridge students must pass a twounit course and a mockcounsel exam PERIOD

We hold our counselors to an incredibly high standard Burger said PERIOD There are quarters where the mockcounsel exam passing rate is  percent others where it is  percent  Its generally on the lower end. despite the requirements necessary to become a Bridge counselor both Burger and Spyropoulos said that the difficult path is by no means a deterrent to most individuals hoping to join the organization PERIOD

Im not sure how much is even known about what percentage gets selected Burger said PERIOD

Other members of the Bridge hypothesized that the decreased retention rate of counselors may be attributed to a shift in the ambience and general feel of the organization over the years PERIOD

One graduating class included only two Bridge counselors despite  of the class members having joined the Bridge in their sophomore year PERIOD

Vickie Wang  explained that a few years ago the Bridge community was more tightknit PERIOD Rogers House was seen not just as a workspace but as a social space PERIOD According to Wang a shift in the clubs atmosphere may have influenced the staff shortage to some extent PERIOD

Bridge members discussed possible strategies to increase the community aspect of the Bridge in a meeting on Monday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Suggestions included transforming the Rogers House into a more social space providing free printing for counselors redecorating the house and providing food for staffers during their shifts PERIOD

The Bridges main strategy for recruiting new members consists of attending dorm meetings throughout campus and discussing the Bridges work prior to the opening of registration for the prerequisite counseling class PERIOD According to Wang once someone joins the Bridge a love and appreciation for the nature of the work may encourage them to stay on staff PERIOD

Despite the staffing shortage Burger emphasized that counselors want to assure students that the Bridge and its services are here to stay PERIOD

Its not ideal but were making it work Burger said PERIOD No one should be worried about the Bridges longevity on campus  we will be here PERIOD Weve been here for a long time and we will continue to be here for a long time. contact Valerie Trapp at trappv22 at stanford.edu PERIOD
