One of the most exciting times of the school year should be the day when a student registers for classes PERIOD



Just think about it PERIOD Students from all different backgrounds come to Eastern or even college in general for one main purpose To take classes PERIOD

But the question is this If thats the reason why students have come to college in the first place why arent they prepared when it comes to choosing next semesters classes Many students do not take registration day seriously enough PERIOD

They do whats required  make an appointment with their adviser PERIOD But the responsibility stops there PERIOD Not enough students take the time before their advising appointment to choose the classes they think will be best for them PERIOD

Its true that advisers are supposed to guide students in taking the right classes PERIOD But if a student has a required course they need to take maybe a general education class like humanities for example  there are plenty of them to choose from PERIOD

The students adviser could probably care less which humanities class the student takes PERIOD They dont know what the students specific interests are i.e PERIOD which humanities class would interest them most PERIOD

Thats why students should prepare before going to their advising appointment PERIOD

First they should log on to PAWS and create an audit PERIOD An audit is like a students transcript that will tell him which classes he still needs to take PERIOD The audit will also list next to each unfulfilled credit which classes he has the option to take PERIOD

Students can then look up classes on PAWS as well PERIOD By doing this they can see at what times the class is offered and which professor teaches the class next semester PERIOD

This is also another benefit of preparing before your appointment PERIOD

If you find a class you like and you have never had the professor before all you have to do is log on to a Web site like RateMyProfessor.com PERIOD By typing in Eastern Illinois University the student can read professor reviews PERIOD They will be able to get a feel for what that professor will be like and what to expect in class PERIOD

If they find out something they personally dont like about a professor it could save them a semester of complaints PERIOD

Another advantage of preparing for an appointment ahead of time is the student can look at the course catalog and read a description of what the class they would like to take will be like PERIOD This can also be a factor in whether the student will take the class PERIOD By having done all this preparation the student is able to have more control on what his next semester will be like PERIOD

Though while PAWS can be helpful in figuring out which class a student has an option to take there is a downside to the system as well PERIOD There have been malfunctions PERIOD If a student overlooks the prerequisites and signs up for a class he is not qualified to take PAWS often still allows that student to register for the class PERIOD This can mess a students schedule up because he may not find out until it is too late and students may potentially find themselves in a class they simply arent qualified to take PERIOD

And even though a student can do a lot of the preparing on his own he shouldnt solely rely on himself for every class he takes PERIOD That is what advisers are for To guide students in the right direction after they have narrowed down their list of interested classes PERIOD

Registration isnt a spectator sport PERIOD There needs to be cooperation between adviser and student PERIOD Either cannot solely do everything PERIOD
