Going away to college is a life event that some kids have the opportunity to do PERIOD Touring the campus during orientation the hustle and bustle of moving in its exciting and exhausting and then you are saying goodbye to your family PERIOD You are saying goodbye to your family and youre alone PERIOD

Last year I transferred to Eastern as a junior psychology major PERIOD I am from a southern suburb of Chicago just about three hours away and I seriously was not nervous about living oncampus at all PERIOD Maybe because I did not have a basis for what living on my own felt like PERIOD I think that is why it was such a shock when the homesickness settled in PERIOD

Do not get me wrong I made friends during prowl weekend two of which Im living with this year but I was in a slump PERIOD I missed my beda queen sized memory foam mattressand my friends from home PERIOD Most of all I missed the loudness of my own family PERIOD

Over last summer I started a group chat with my tobe suite mates PERIOD I wanted to get to know them and make plans PERIOD It started off all right but while we planned movie nights and little events like bowling at the Union we did not follow through with any of them PERIOD Because of that my suite grew quiet and very uncomfortable PERIOD

I remember my fun fact about me for our first ever floor meeting went like this My names Megan and I dont know Im just really missing my family right now. not to be dramatic but I literally felt like I was three being dropped off at preschool which I dropped out of because I hated being away from my mom and sister PERIOD

I didnt drop out of Eastern though PERIOD Obviously PERIOD

To be fair to myself I have very rarely had moments to myself since  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD Well since I was born I guess PERIOD And while I had made other friends everything was still fresh and so PERIOD I was by myself with myself from the time my classes ended until I went to class the next day PERIOD

There were a lot of issues in my suite PERIOD It happens to most people I think but it grew to be completely miserable and I often called my dad to drive three hours to pick me up and drive me back home for weekends when the bus was not available PERIOD

There is a turnaround to this and if you or anyone you know is feeling homesick this weekend I implore you to go out PERIOD Those nice people you met on your floor see if they want to grab lunch PERIOD

Those kids in class that you are forced into a group project with get to know them PERIOD They might be cool PERIOD

If my year had continued to be miserableif the friends I made had not eventually moved into my suiteI probably would have transferred to a different school PERIOD For me adjusting to Eastern andthis yearnot being homesick at all had to do with the connections I made on campus PERIOD
