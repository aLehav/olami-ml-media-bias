5986,2023-07-11,"in a UT System Board of Regents meeting Thursday Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa recommended President William Powers Jr PERIOD remain in office despite describing the current relationship between Powers and the UT System as strained. after the meeting Powers said he was appreciative of the chancellors support but declined to comment on rumors that head coach Mack Brown will be replaced by Nick Saban current head football coach at theUniversity of Alabama PERIOD Powers who has supported Brown in the past makes hiring and firing decisions alongside recentlyhired athletic director Steve Patterson PERIOD

Well discuss football at the appropriate time Powers said after the board meeting PERIOD

UT spokesman Gary Susswein said a meeting between Powers Brown and Patterson will occur in a short period of time. brown denied circulating reports that he is stepping down as head football coach at a press conference Thursday for the upcoming Alamo Bowl stating his situation has not changed. cigarroa said a primary source of tension between Powers and the system was an inconsistency between Powers public and private statements to the chancellor and others PERIOD

The main reason for the strain is that Bill and I would agree on certain principles and then I would act on those principles but then Bill Powers would often convey a message of misalignment leading to conflict between UT system administration and the University of Texas at Austin Cigarroa said PERIOD

Cigarroa said it was clear Powers has enormous support from faculty members graduate and undergraduate students and alumni PERIOD

There exists strong faculty undergraduate and graduate student support for President Powers represented by three resolutions of support by each group PERIOD There exists strong alumni support for President Powers Cigarroa said PERIOD The alumni and the University of Texas at Austin staff and the development board are working exceptionally hard and are in reach of achieving the  billion capital campaign call by August of . cigarroa also said he was aware that firing Powers might diminish the Universitys ability to hire other administrators PERIOD

The president and provost are making great progress in the hiring of a dean of the Dell School of Medicine Cigarroa said PERIOD Ive also been told that a change of leadership in this moment would jeopardize recruitment of an outstanding dean as well as other important leaders. powers said he appreciated the chancellors continued support PERIOD

I do appreciate as Ive said before the chancellors support the chairmans support and I very very much look forward to working on moving our University going ahead Powers said PERIOD

Cigarroa said he is hopeful of a brighter horizon in the relationship with Powers that he acknowledges has its problems PERIOD

It is my full expectation that together President Powers and I will work towards resolving them and moving ahead Cigarroa said PERIOD

Board chairman Paul Foster said he hoped the System and University would be able to move on from the tensions of the past few months PERIOD Currently Regent Wallace Hall is under investigation by the House Select Committee on Transparency for allegations that he overstepped his role as a regent PERIOD Cigarroa and Powers have both been subpoenaed to testify later this month PERIOD

Im optimistic about the future of UT Austin and Im confident all this controversy will soon be a distant memory Foster said PERIOD

Student Government president Horacio Villarreal said he was happy with the chancellors announcement of support despite the stress he experienced during the prolonged meeting PERIOD The regents closed executive session which was scheduled to last until  PM went on for almost two extra hours before reopening at  PM PERIOD

Obviously Im incredibly pleased and overwhelmed Villarreal said PERIOD The fact that we waited for a while as the regents stayed in executive session talking for quite some time had us a little bit on edge  but the fact that we do have support from the chancellor is absolutely incredible. relations between Powers and certain members of the board including Hall Alex Cranberg and Gene Powell have been tense for several years PERIOD

At a meeting in March amidst conflict involving the UT School of Laws forgivable loan program Regent Steven Hicks said he would prefer the board address Powers employment status directly if that was the true motivation regents had for continuing investigations into the program PERIOD

It would be simpler to me instead of spending the money to continue an additional external investigation Hicks said at the meeting PERIOD If thats the real goal lets just put that on the table and deal with it. at that meeting in a  vote the Board of Regents decided to begin a new external review of the UT Law School Foundations relationship to the School of Law PERIOD In  Powers asked Larry Sager then dean of the School of Law to resign after it was revealed Sager received a  forgivable loan as part of a program administered by the Foundation PERIOD Though Hall maintained Powers knew about the loan program while it was ongoing Powers firmly denied his knowledge PERIOD

Any implication that what occurred today is about not being transparent or forthcoming with information to the System or perhaps to the Regents is simply false Powers said in March PERIOD

Ultimately after requests from several legislators the Regents voted to allow the Texas Attorney General to conduct an additional investigation rather than proceeding with the  external investigation PERIOD

Tensions have also impacted daytoday operations at the University PERIOD In August the University announced Greg Fenves dean of the Cockrell School of Engineering would replace outgoing provost Steven Leslie after a smaller and faster job search than is typical for a highlevel position largely as a result of instability on campus Powers said PERIOD

The process of going about looking for a provost with a full natural search or normal committee will be difficult to do Powers said at a Faculty Council meeting in March PERIOD Were in a tricky situation. alan Friedman an English professor and a former Faculty Council chairman who has worked at the University since  told The Texan in April that he feels the boards actions have an impact on faculty morale and decisionmaking PERIOD

There is a good deal of talk about what is happening on campus as a result of the regents actions and some if it does factor into faculty members who are not staying or who are not coming Friedman said PERIOD I think a lot of faculty members feel the campus is under siege from the very people who are appointed to protect and support the quality of the educational experience on this campus. music professor Martha Hilley who is past chair of the UT Faculty Council was tearyeyed after the meeting adjourned PERIOD

Other than the tears Im very hopeful Hilley laughed PERIOD Were going to get to work quickly. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Powers remains University president despite “strained relationship” with System – The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
