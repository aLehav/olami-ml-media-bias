George Miller  Tuesday September  

Students as a member of the Class of  I am tired of seeing our fine tradition of producing competitive football teams diminished to being the joke of the day on national TV programs for years now PERIOD The college sport is a minor league for the NFL do not kid yourselves PERIOD We need the horses and they can too graduate PERIOD Just look at all the graduates Lou Holtz produced PERIOD The difference is we now are not attracting blue chip players who can compete at the top levels as in the past PERIOD

Lobby for change to bring us back now
