WASHINGTON NATIONALS
 RECORD  No PERIOD  in NL EAST

Last year the Washington Nationals were the leader of the National League East winning the division by eight games PERIOD They were eliminated in the first round by the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games and are still looking for their first postseason series victory since the team moved from Montreal in  PERIOD

Over the offseason Washington had one major addition and one big subtraction PERIOD They acquired outfielder Adam Eaton in a trade with the Chicago White Sox PERIOD Eaton quietly had a fantastic  season and the Nationals hope that he will bolster what was already an excellent offense PERIOD Outfielder Bryce Harper declined in form last year following an impressive MVP campaign in  PERIOD The Nationals still have very high hopes for him and a rebound by Harper will be key for Washingtons fortunes PERIOD

The offense goes far beyond Eaton and Harper PERIOD Second baseman Daniel Murphy finished second in the NL MVP voting last year leading the league in doubles slugging percentage and onbase plus slugging OPS PERIOD Shortstop Trea Turner had a stellar rookie campaign hitting . while clubbing  home runs in  games played PERIOD Nationals fans are excited to see him play a full season for the first time PERIOD

While theres no doubt the Nationals offense is the most potent in the East their pitching is a bit of a question mark PERIOD They lost the most important part of the bullpen this offseason when closer Mark Melancon signed with the San Francisco Giants PERIOD His loss leaves the role of closer in Washington an open position PERIOD The part most likely will be played by Shawn Kelley who had a . eRA and seven saves last year while serving as Melancons setup man PERIOD

Starter Max Scherzer led the rotation last year having another one of his typically excellent seasons PERIOD Unfortunately he has been impacted by a stress fracture in his knuckle which knocked him out of the World Baseball Classic and puts his opening day status in doubt PERIOD Pitcher Stephen Strasburg who still has not quite lived up to the skyhigh expectations that accompanied the start of the career is recovering from a partial tear in his right elbow PERIOD

While Washington has pitching questions the offense should carry them to a playoff spot once again PERIOD If Harper can recover his  form and Turner improves off his rookie season this division could be a runaway PERIOD

 PREDICTION  No PERIOD  in NL EAST



NEW YORK METS
 RECORD  No PERIOD  in NL EAST

New York managed to secure a wild card spot last year despite a starting pitching staff ravaged by injury and an almost nonexistent offense PERIOD That offense came back to bite them in the NL wild card game where they were shut out by pitcher Madison Bumgarner of the San Francisco Giants PERIOD

Going into  the hope of the Mets is that all their young and exciting starters are healthy and ready to go PERIOD The starter who survived the season unscathed was Noah Syndergaard who had a great season PERIOD He struck out  batters in . innings while making the AllStar team and finishing eighth in the NL Cy Young voting PERIOD He hopes to be accompanied in the rotation by Jacob deGrom who had a . eRA before his season ended in early September Steven Matz who finished sixth in the Rookie of the Year voting and was lost to injury in midAugust and Matt Harvey the promising starter who missed all of  after Tommy John surgery PERIOD Closer Jeurys Familia saved  games in a row between  and  for the thirdbest streak in major league history PERIOD

The Mets hope these pitchers can take them a long way because they do not have much of an offense PERIOD The team resigned outfielder Yoenis Cespedes last offseason after an excellent second half of  and a productive  season PERIOD

The rest of the offense is at best full of question marks PERIOD Outfielder Michael Conforto started  strong but quickly faded away PERIOD Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera performed admirably in his Mets debut last season posting a . wAR PERIOD Third baseman David Wright remains the leader of the team but his status for the season is in question due to shoulder issues PERIOD

New York looks like the opposite of the Nationals PERIOD The pitching rotation is very promising albeit unproven PERIOD The offense doesnt appear to be very strong however and that will cost them a National League East title this year PERIOD

 PREDICTION  No PERIOD  in NL EAST



ATLANTA BRAVES
 RECORD  No PERIOD  in NL EAST

The Braves started  horribly going  in their first  games PERIOD In their last  games they went a morethanrespectable  PERIOD The question in  then is which version of the Braves will show up this year

Atlantas player to watch this year will be shortstop prospect Dansby Swanson PERIOD In  games with the Braves last year he hit . and slugged . pERIOD Swanson the No PERIOD  draft pick of the  MLB draft has high expectations for his seaso and a great campaign by him will be the key for Atlanta to improve this year PERIOD

Hell be surrounded by a solid offense including veteran first baseman Freddie Freeman and outfielder Ender Inciarte PERIOD The latter was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks prior to the  season and blossomed in Atlanta hitting . with a respectable . wAR PERIOD He doesnt have much power to speak of  he hit just three home runs in  atbats last year  but gets on base enough to make him a productive offensive player PERIOD

At the trade deadline last year the Braves acquired outfielder Matt Kemp from the San Diego Padres PERIOD The onetime MVP runnerup had a great second half for Atlanta and figures to be an important part of an increasingly potent offense PERIOD

The pitching staff was bolstered in the offseason with the acquisitions of the ageless wonder Bartolo Colon and knuckleballer R.A PERIOD Dickey PERIOD Theyll accompany Julio Teheran who had an impressive . eRA despite a poor  winloss record PERIOD

The promise that the Braves showed last year gives fans reason to believe the team will take a big step forward in  PERIOD If everything breaks right a . season is not out of the question PERIOD

 PREDICTION  No PERIOD  in NL EAST



MIAMI MARLINS
 RECORD  No PERIOD  in NL EAST

The Marlins who have not made the playoffs since  looked like wild card contenders for most last season PERIOD Over the last few weeks of the season the dream slowly died and they coughed and lurched to the finish line going  after Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

If starter Jose Fernandez had not passed away in a boat crash last September the Marlins would look poised for another playoff bid this year PERIOD He was the anchor of that rotation and his loss has left it in shambles PERIOD

The closest thing to an ace pitcher the Marlins have is Edinson Volquez who pitched well on the Kansas City Royals championship team in  PERIOD Unfortunately he struggled throughout  with an abysmal . eRA PERIOD WeiYin Chen showed some promise with Miami last year but hes hardly a fearsome pitcher PERIOD Dan Straily was acquired from the Cincinnati Reds this offseason and he sported a solid . eRA last year PERIOD

The leaders of the offense are outfielders Christian Yelich and Giancarlo Stanton PERIOD Yelich had a breakthrough season last year hitting . with  home runs and a . wAR PERIOD He finished nineteenth in the MVP voting and many pundits predict he will do even better this year PERIOD

Stanton has a reputation as one of the most fearsome sluggers in baseball but has a hard time staying healthy PERIOD He played just  games out of a possible  between  and  PERIOD When on the field hes capable of great things PERIOD When he played  games in  he led the NL in home runs total bases and slugging percentage and finished second in the NL MVP voting PERIOD

While Yelich and Stanton will provide stability for the offense the lack of quality starting pitching will be the downfall of the Marlins this year PERIOD

 PREDICTION  No PERIOD  in NL EAST



PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES
 RECORD  No PERIOD  in NL EAST

With the departure of slugger Ryan Howard in the offseason that means everyone from the dominant  Phillies teams are no longer on the team PERIOD Its a new era in Philadelphia as a franchise that has been lost in the wilderness for several years will seek to get on the path to rebuilding PERIOD

Several people have taken note of a young and promising Phillies pitching rotation PERIOD Vince Velazquez was acquired in a trade with the Houston Astros last offseason and turned heads early in the  season with a 16strikeout nowalk complete game shutout PERIOD He struck out . batters per nine innings last year the sixthbest mark in the league PERIOD Jerad Eickoff had the lowest ERA on the staff last year at . while Jeremy Hellickson posted a decent  record with a . eRA and  strikeouts PERIOD

The offense will be interesting this year as almost every member of the everyday lineup will be under the age of  PERIOD Center fielder Odubel Herrera was the best offensive player on the team last year and he hopes to improve further this year in his third MLB season PERIOD Second baseman Cesar Hernandez led the team in batting last year at . while third baseman Maikel Franco clubbed  home runs PERIOD

Philadelphia while they have some promising pieces are clearly not built to contend this year PERIOD However they could make noise in the near future if everything pans out PERIOD
