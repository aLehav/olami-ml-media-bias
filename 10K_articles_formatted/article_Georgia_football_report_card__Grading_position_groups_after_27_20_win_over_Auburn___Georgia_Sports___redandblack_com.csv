Georgia football defeated Auburn  on Saturday in its first road game of the season PERIOD Following the game The Red  Black graded each position groups performance PERIOD

Georgias offense came out with a slow start again PERIOD The first two drives in Carson Becks road debut resulted in a punt and interception which dug the Bulldogs an early hole PERIOD Beck continued to play up and down finding receivers but also missing a few throws PERIOD He finished with  passing yards going 23for33 PERIOD While he showed flashes of being able to comfortably throw the ball downfield progress needs to be made to clean up offensive errors and find receivers for more than just short completions PERIOD

Grade C

Daijun Edwards has now scored two touchdowns each in consecutive games PERIOD Edwards wasnt perfect however as he nearly cost Georgia with a fumble in the second quarter that was overturned to be ruled down PERIOD

As a group Georgia finished with  rushing yards its secondlowest total this season PERIOD Previously Auburns rush defense was ranked seventy-first in the nation allowing  rushing yards per game PERIOD Edwards and receiver Dillon Bell were the only Bulldogs to finish with doubledigit rushing yards with  and  each PERIOD The running back room was again without the injured Roderick Robinson PERIOD

Edwards contributions were not enough to overshadow an otherwise weaker allaround performance PERIOD

Grade C

Brock Bowers continued to be Georgias trump card breaking the game open and bailing the Bulldogs out of another slow start PERIOD While Bowers entered the fourth quarter with only two catches he dominated the final frame ending with five more PERIOD

Bowers teamhigh  receiving yards were significantly ahead of the closest receivers PERIOD However the runnerup was Ladd McConkey who made his debut after missing the first four games of the season with a back injury PERIOD McConkey finished with four receptions for a total of  yards and made some huge plays on third downs for Georgia PERIOD

Grade B

Playing again without starting right tackle Amarius Mims the offensive line had to adapt and continue to shift to make up for Mims absence PERIOD The unit did its job in pass protection for the most part and did not allow a sack PERIOD However the run blocking was lackluster and Georgia only averaged . yards per carry PERIOD As the unit gains more experience it will hopefully mesh more with the run game going forward PERIOD

Grade C

Georgias defensive line suffered an early shock after allowing Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne to scramble for a 61yard run just five minutes into the game PERIOD

However the defensive line also landed two sacks on Thorne in the first quarter coming from linebacker Xavian Sorey and defensive back Tykee Smith PERIOD In the third quarter Georgias defense kept its pressure up with linebacker Smael Mondon landing a third and final sack on Thorne PERIOD

The Bulldogs held the Tigers to just 2for12 on third down but also allowed the Tigers to reach  rushing yards the most Georgia has given up this season PERIOD For the first time in five years Georgia allowed their opponent to rush for at least  yards PERIOD

Grade D

Outside of sacks from Sorey and Mondon Georgias linebackers were also run down by the success of Auburns backfield PERIOD Both miscommunication and missed tackles allowed Thorne and running back Jarquez Hunter to lead the Tigers with  and  rushing yards respectively PERIOD

On a positive note Mondon continued to lead Georgias linebacker unit tying his careerhigh with  tackles against the Tigers PERIOD

Grade C

Auburn hardly threw the ball on Saturday but Georgias secondary played well when it did PERIOD Out of Auburns  pass attempts none of them resulted in a touchdown and the secondary held them to a total of  receiving yards PERIOD

Georgia also held three of Auburns top four receivers to under  yards PERIOD Tight end Rivaldo Fariweather led the Tigers with only  receiving yards PERIOD

Up  Malaki Starks secured Georgias win with an interception to end Auburns final drive of the game picking off Thorne on a fourth down PERIOD

Grade B

Peyton Woodring was accurate when Georgia needed him most PERIOD Woodring brought the Bulldogs to a tie twice against the Tigers marking a new career high with both extra points PERIOD

Woodring was called on to tie the game in the second quarter down  after a missed third down PERIOD The kick from  yards was good and also two yards ahead of Woodrings previous careerhigh against Ball State PERIOD Georgia needed the freshman once more in the fourth quarter trailing  with close to  minutes left of play PERIOD Again Woodring lined up and made the  yard attempt PERIOD

Receiver Mekhi Mews came out strong as the main returner for Georgias special teams after fumbling on a return against Ball State PERIOD The walkon returned three kicks for a total of  yards PERIOD His 41yard return in the first quarter jumpstarted Georgias first scoring drive of the game PERIOD

Grade A

Over the course of  minutes on Saturday night Brock Bowers mightve singlehandedly saved Georgias national championship hopes PERIOD The  John Mackey Award winners fourth quarter catapulted the Bulldogs to another win and helped them avoid one of the biggest upsets in college football PERIOD
