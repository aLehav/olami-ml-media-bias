7663,2014-02-12,"recovering from Tommy John surgery as a baseball player is a tough process PERIOD The time the uncertainty and not even being able to play catch can on an offday make a ballplayer go mad PERIOD But Oregon ace Cole Irvin whos  campaign was cut short due to an injury that required his surgery is now able to throw a baseball again PERIOD He talked to the Emerald about the status of his recovery and his feelings about the healing process PERIOD

Howre you feeling

Feeling good PERIOD Im coming back strong PERIOD Summer went well and rehabbing went really well over summer so everything looks up right now PERIOD But you never know though PERIOD You have to prepare yourself for setbacks PERIOD

Have you been ona mound

Yeah I do a lot of dry work PERIOD You know the moment you get off a mound and are injured you just want to get right back on it PERIOD So even though I wont be throwing or anything off of it I do a lot of visualization PERIOD Just a lot of things that will help me get prepared for the season PERIOD

When did you first throw something

I cant remember PERIOD Its on my Instagram PERIOD It was like  feet at the beginning of summer PERIOD The first throw was very tentative PERIOD Then the second throw was loose like OK I can throw now Im OK Im comfortable PERIOD But the favorite thing of a baseball player is to play catch PERIOD There is nothing better than playing catch PERIOD That was exciting to play catch for the first time again PERIOD

Do you think there will still be some of that tentativeness when you first take a mound

Ive gotten to throw enough now where Im going to be confident when I get on the mound PERIOD I know my limits and on my protocol it tells me I needto be at 75percent or 50percent not full blown go for it PERIOD I need to progress and be patient and know that its going to take time PERIOD

What were theactual gameslike for you last year

The experience and I did a lot of it over summer was coaching PERIOD But I dont coach my teammates I help my teammates PERIOD That was the biggest thing I learned throughout this whole process was the fact I got to help my teammates which made our team better PERIOD Whether or not I pitched on the field I still helped contribute to a team and what we did last year PERIOD I pride myself that Im still able to be a veteran guy and still able to help our team get better PERIOD

Do you feel like you can be the guy you were yourfreshman year and even better next year

Im not going to live up to any expectations PERIOD Yeah there is an expectation for myself but coming off a surgery you cant weigh yourself down with the expectations you had especially for me off my freshman year PERIOD Because that was my freshman year and this is a new year with a new group of guys and a new pursuit for a dream PERIOD
