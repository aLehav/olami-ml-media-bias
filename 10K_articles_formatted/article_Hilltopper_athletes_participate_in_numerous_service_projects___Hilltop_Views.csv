Student athletes on campus are working to exhibit St PERIOD Edwards University values by taking time out of their hectic schedules to volunteer for organizations around Austin PERIOD

The Student Athlete Advisory Council planned several service projects this semester PERIOD Among them were visits to the Phoenix House drug abuse treatment center Gardener Betts Juvenile Detention Center and the Helping Hand Childrens Home where they hosted events for kids and young adults PERIOD

St PERIOD Edwards womens basketball player and junior Brittany Ward is involved in planning and carrying out these projects PERIOD She said she is emotionally touched by the appreciation the children have for the athletes services PERIOD

It means a lot to me that they know our names ask us when were coming back and tell us how much it means to them for us to be there Ward said PERIOD

A group of student athletes hosted the Teeny Topper Olympics for the Helping Hand Childrens Home PERIOD It consisted of four to five 20minute stations where the children learn skills from different sports including football soccer and softball PERIOD

The student athletes also held games of Matball for the Gardener Betts Juvenile Detention Center PERIOD Matball is baseballlike game played in the gym and modified to fit the rules and regulation of the detention center Ward said PERIOD

After the activities student athletes took questions from the invited group about college or any inquiry about life PERIOD They also handed out certificates to the participants PERIOD

Bennett a member of SAAC is one of the students that is selling stars for charity PERIOD She says that helping others is a sure way to put a smile on her face PERIOD

Community service is important to me because I feel like giving back to the community is a great way to fully appreciate the things life has blessed you with Bennett said PERIOD It definitely contributes to a person being wellrounded and truly makes a difference in the world PERIOD It provides me with so much joy knowing that I might have been a part of making someones day a little brighter. although projects are not mandatory student athletes are encouraged to participate in projects and often coaches will set hourly requirements to help motivate their teams to participate PERIOD

I truly believe volunteering is a vital and essential part of life Ward said PERIOD It means so much to touch just one life of someone in need PERIOD And who knows you just may be the one person they needed to support them to get their life on track. sports
