The University of Mississippi Esports team has been restricted from practicing certain games following a Mississippi ban on the use of software created by Tencent on government devices PERIOD

Effective July  Senate Bill  requires state universities to discontinue the use of TikTok and other applications developed by the Chinabased companies ByteDance and Tencent PERIOD The bill also requires prevention of access to these applications from universityowned devices and university networks PERIOD

In a letter to the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services Governor Tate Reeves attributed the restriction of the software to cybersecurity concerns PERIOD

Applications and websites such as TikTok can provide the Chinese Communist Party the technology to gain access to information stored on such devices including location services and browsing history Reeves said PERIOD

In response to the bill Ole Miss restricted the practice of Tencentowned games Valorant and League of Legends on university networks on September  two of the largest titles in the current esports scene PERIOD

Matthew Denton a sophomore computer science major at Ole Miss and Valorant game coordinator for Ole Miss Esports said students living in dormitories cannot practice and the team cannot hold tryouts in their oncampus esports facility PERIOD

That cuts off a large amount of our incoming player base that I would be hoping would come try out  they cant really do that anymore Denton said PERIOD Its hard to imagine what it would be like without new players coming in because thats what we thats what we thrive on. denton said that League of Legends is one of the most significant games to Ole Miss Esports with several collegiate world champions on the team PERIOD

We were all blindsided PERIOD No one knew that something like this could even happen PERIOD Completely unaware we just woke up one day and tried to open the game and wouldnt open Denton said PERIOD

John McDermott esports director at Ole Miss said that despite the ban the future is bright for Mississippi esports PERIOD

Its very disappointing that our students who have demonstrated remarkable success on a national stage have had their seasons interrupted by factors beyond their control McDermott said PERIOD We will continue to compete in these games and are actively exploring options that allow us to do so that comply with state law. mississippi State University Esports has not yet been affected by the bill PERIOD Raj Patel assistant systems administrator in the MSU Department of Computer Science and Engineering said the MSU Department of Information Technology Services is actively reviewing software related to the bill PERIOD

MSU Esports president Colin Klein a senior in software engineering said that some of the best players in the nation moved on from MSU Esports PERIOD Klein said that a restriction of Tencentowned games would have negative effects on MSU Esports PERIOD

If it did affect us and if we did abandon the Valorant and League team we would lose our number one most played game at State as well as our most popular with League of Legends which features five of the best players weve had in years Klein said PERIOD

MSU Chief Information Officer Steve Parrott said MSU is committed to complying with state law PERIOD

Since the inception of Mississippis prohibitions against the use of several technologies on stateowned devices and networks Mississippi State University has to the best of our abilities complied with state law and will continue to do so Parrott said PERIOD As it relates to esports we will closely monitor guidance from the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services and other officials PERIOD Our desire is to comply with state law while at the same time doing all we can to help our esports students remain competitive. the Esports Egg Bowl is an annual tradition in which Ole Miss and MSU esports teams compete in a tournament PERIOD It is the largest esports event of either program and provides exposure to players as well as the support of multiple sponsors PERIOD

Denton said hes optimistic that Ole Miss Esports will be able to compete in the sixth annual Esports Egg Bowl on October  PERIOD If the Egg Bowl is affected he is hopeful that the exposure will lead to compromise PERIOD

I could definitely see it as some sort of like call out Denton said PERIOD Having such a big event with so many people under a message of like unban these games whatever PERIOD I can definitely see it being pretty helpful towards the cause if there is a cause when the Egg Bowl is happening. log In
