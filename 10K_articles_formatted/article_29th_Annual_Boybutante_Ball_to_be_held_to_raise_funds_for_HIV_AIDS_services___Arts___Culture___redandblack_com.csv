The proposed Hot Corner Historic District would include  Watt Club Morton Theatre and other buildings on the west side of downtown PERIOD

On Saturday April  the  Watt Club in downtown Athens will host the twenty-ninth Annual Boybutante Ball an event that raises money for HIVAIDS support and services for the areas of northeast Georgia PERIOD The Boybutante Ball is a largerthanlife drag show that will feature performances from professional drag queens from all over the south in a tantalizingly fun performance of sights and sounds PERIOD

Our tagline is Partying for a Cause and I think thats what people have come to expect said Rob Hagwood the Lay Director of the Boybutante Foundation PERIOD If you come to a Boybutante event and dont have a good time its because you didnt want to. since it began in  the Boybutante Ball has raised over  for AIDS service organizations and has expanded to include a weeklong schedule at various venues in downtown Athens including a Drag Search competition at Hendershots Coffee Drag Bingo at The Graduate Hotel and a Ball Survivors Brunch catered by Mamas Boy at the Athens Cotton Press PERIOD

We work really hard to make our events light and fun Hagwood said PERIOD But also we want to talk about why were there and why were doing what were doing PERIOD Weve always tried to approach it in a way that if we do the work and focus on having a good time the money will come. the funds raised from Boybutante events are used to provide resources support and services to those living with HIVAIDS PERIOD Money will also go towards funding educational programs targeted at HIVAIDS prevention andor the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIVAIDSaffected individuals PERIOD

Despite the event seeming more like a party than a fundraiser it is important to remember that at the events heart it seeks to provide a better life for those who are suffering from HIVAIDS PERIOD

For me its just realizing that the fight is not over Hagwood said PERIOD There are still people who are being newly diagnosed and seroconverting today and until that stops and there is an end to this we need to keep doing what were doing. the Boybutante Foundation remains dedicated to bringing attention to the HIVAIDS crisis in a highenergy form of entertainment that will have every audience member wanting to return again and again PERIOD

As long as people remember that its still an epidemic and were not done with this yet Hagwood said PERIOD We always say that Boybutante will happen as long as we have to do it and then well keep doing it because we want to do it. doors for the Boybutante Ball will open at  p.m PERIOD with the show beginning at  p.m PERIOD Information on ticket purchases and on all Boybutante related events can be found online PERIOD Tickets for the ball are  and can be purchased online or at any other Boybutante event PERIOD This event usually sells out so be sure to secure your tickets ahead of the show PERIOD

The walls of The Globe seemed to warp inward with bass as music thundered PERIOD Multicolored lights washed over the faces of performers as they danced on the tables transforming a cramped stale bar into center stage.The bass was still ringing in Alex Suarezs ears as he walked home that night painted in drag running the routine through his head over and over PERIOD Between the chorus and the verse rolling through his mind the colors and music dissolved around him when what felt like a brick came hurtling toward him PERIOD
