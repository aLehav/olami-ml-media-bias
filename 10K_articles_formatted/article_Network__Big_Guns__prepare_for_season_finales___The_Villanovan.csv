It has been a fantastic year to cover television with plenty of great dramas and comedies for audiences to sink their teeth into PERIOD

As networks approach May several interesting finales are on the horizon PERIOD Here is a look at some of the big ones PERIOD

Greys Anatomy

To say this season has been rocky would be an understatement PERIOD From Izzie spending time with the ghost of Denny for half a season the lack of screen time for T PERIOD R PERIOD Knight and the firing of Brooke Smith the show has had its share of problems PERIOD

Somewhere along the way the show found itself as the addition of exmilitary doctor Owen Hunt Kevin McKidd along with compelling plots led to some excellent episodes PERIOD

Highlights include the wellbuilt Lexie GreyMark Sloan romance Meredith and Derek getting engaged Hunt and Cristina struggling through their issues to find love and Karev continuing to mature PERIOD

In the finale you can expect Izzie to have some complications with her cancer Meredith and Derek to be married or close to it and George heading off to war PERIOD

The twohour event promises to be controversial and exciting as the show prepares for the possible exits of Knight and Katherine Heigl after this season PERIOD

The Office

With the Michael Scott Paper Company arc coming to a close last week the dynamics in the office are somewhat back to normal  except for the fact that Ryan has been hired back full time and Pam is now a salesperson PERIOD

It will be fun to watch how the rest of the office reacts to the changes especially now that Michael is in charge again PERIOD

The finale promises some great stuff as it will be the companys annual picnic and Holly Amy Ryan will return PERIOD

Will Michael and Holly rekindle their romance Are Pam and Jim going to get married this season Tune in on May  to find out PERIOD

Lost

In the last new episode a few weeks back time travel expert Daniel Faraday made his triumphant return to the island in  which is where Jack Kate Sawyer Juliet Jin Miles Hurley and Sayid are stuck PERIOD

With their cover as members in the Dharma Initiative about to be blown the castaways will have to find a way back to the present and Faraday seems to be the man who will get them there PERIOD

In present day Benjamin Linus was told by the smoke monster to follow the resurrected John Locke if he wants to live PERIOD

Sun is looking for a way to find Jin PERIOD There is also a new group of people from the Ajira flight that seem to have an agenda on the island PERIOD

Michael Emerson called the finale an explosive twohour movielike event that will supposedly reveal Jacob to the audience see a major character die and hopefully bring all the characters back to the same time period PERIOD

 Rock

After two Emmy wins for best comedy in a row  Rock has come out with its zaniest season yet featuring its collection of great characters along with world class guest stars such as Jon Hamm and Salma Hayek PERIOD

The season finale will introduce Jacks dad Alan Alda while also featuring several guest music stars including Sheryl Crow Mary J PERIOD Blige and Adam Levine PERIOD The preview indicates that Liz will become a relationship expert and Tracy will speak at a high school graduation with Kenneths help PERIOD

With the gueststar lineup there is no doubt this will be the most offthewall episode of the season and feature plenty of laughs PERIOD

Private Practice

Shonda Rhimes spinoff has capitalized on following Greys on Thursday nights attracting enough of an audience to earn a renewal for next season PERIOD

Though a medical drama like Greys the shows setting at the L.A.based Oceanside Wellness Clinic has differentiated the show from its sister and turned into an engaging drama PERIOD

The storylines coming to a head right now include whether Addison will break up a marriage by getting together with married heart doctor Noah Josh Hopkins if Violets baby is Petes or Sheldons and for which practice Naomi will choose to work PERIOD

Hopkins has stated that the final moments tonight are shocking so the episode tonight should be enthralling PERIOD
