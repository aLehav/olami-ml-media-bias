On a campus as large as UTs there is great potential for diversity PERIOD Tens of thousands of people attend our school each with their own unique story and background PERIOD

Although UT remains a predominantly white institution it is still home to students faculty and staff of all religions ethnicities nationalities sexualities and gender identities PERIOD In order to fully support one another because of not despite our differences it is essential that we as Volunteers learn to embrace the opportunities provided by intersectionality and diversity  the opportunity to support those who are similar to us and different and the opportunity to learn a thing or two along the way PERIOD

Intersectionality stresses the importance of considering multiple demographic variables at once in order to gain a better understanding of how particular groups become the targets of discrimination PERIOD When we start viewing our world through the lens of intersectionality we gain a better understanding of how those different from us experience struggles that we havent  and maybe even a better understanding of how we have been discriminated against or have contributed to discrimination PERIOD

This year has been a great learning experience for many Americans  and humanity in general  in many different areas of life but behind all of the years major events is one truth differences among us are beneficial not harmful PERIOD Diversity is a positive attribute not something that should divide us PERIOD

As students we are at a unique position in our lives where we have access to an education that is valuable not only through what is taught in the classroom but also the experiences that accompany the degree  experiences that can include friendships with people who may be exactly like you and others who couldnt be more different PERIOD Experiences with friends youve known from high school and others who moved to Knoxville from halfway across the world PERIOD

In this issue we highlight just a few of our campuss minority student organizations and people among a few other subjects PERIOD We do not claim to represent or attempt to represent groups which we are not a part of but instead hope to draw attention to the importance of diversity on our campus PERIOD

Vol means all PERIOD
