The pandemic made several changes within the framework of our daily lives relationships politics health economies and jobs PERIOD

Now three years after the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic many jobs are changing with the growth of the fourday workweek PERIOD

The fiveday workweek was first implemented after advocacy in the early 1900s that resulted in the creation of the weekend and the eradication of the sixday workweek PERIOD

As time continues more people have fought for less days and less hours a sentiment confidently forecast by individuals like German philosopher Karl Marx and English economist John Maynard Keynes PERIOD

Keynes may have predicted the 15hour workweek in his  essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren. for three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us Keynes said PERIOD

Although many jump to despising or praising the fourday workweek there are two concepts commonly implemented using the term PERIOD

When enacted some workers may continue working a typical 40hour workweek and work  hours a day while others may work their traditional hours  eight hours a day  while only working for four days PERIOD

In   businesses in Britain offered their employees fourday workweeks as part of a pilot program and  of the companies said they would continue with the fourday workweek PERIOD

Those companies explained their interest in continuing due to factors like consistent revenueover the trial period no or minimum loss of productivity and employee retention PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Chris Clark an economics professor at GC explained how the fourday workweek enactment may only influence the lives of some employees PERIOD

If it only applies to salaried workers I dont know that it changes anything in a meaningful way Clark said PERIOD If it applies to hourly workers it has meaningful impacts in terms of productivity but if you maintain the amount of hours worked the output stays roughly the same. supporters of the movement have argued that the implementation would result in increased productivity more commitment from employees employee satisfaction mental health benefits and positive environmental impacts PERIOD

However others argue that the enactment of these arrangements would not benefit companies or the average employee PERIOD

Criticism of the fourday workweek also describes the possibilities of shortlived morale boosts burnout and fleeting optimism all of which could lead to a decrease in productivity PERIOD

As a society we kind of have to ask Are we willing to give up some income Clark said PERIOD Essentially thats what it boils down to. freshman Em Jones an English major explained how the change may affect the future PERIOD

I want to be an editor for a publishing house so I imagine I will have a standard workweek and when it comes to choosing where I want to work if one place has a fourday workweek Id rather go with that than a fiveday workweek Jones said PERIOD

Researchers wonder how the changes will affect the state of employment and how the enactments will affect workers PERIOD

Rather than the whole country switching tomorrow to a fourday workweek what would probably happen is people who prefer a fourday workweek would pick a job that aligns with that Clark said The economy just evolves based on that. the pandemic illustrated other possibilities for the workplace which may have caused workers to seek interest in the concept of the fourday workweek PERIOD

I think the pandemic definitely contributes Clark said PERIOD Some people got used to working from home and they understood that they could do their work with different modalities to get the work done. rep PERIOD Mark Takano of California recently introduced a bill to reduce the standard workweek to  hours PERIOD

The bill includes workers who are typically paid hourly and would mean employers would need to hire more workers and employees would arrange higher wages and alter labor conditions PERIOD

The ThirtyTwo Hour Workweek Act would improve the quality of life of workers meeting the demand for a more truncated workweek that allows room to live play and enjoy life more fully outside of work Takano said PERIOD

The future of the fourday workweek is fairly unknown as it has not been implemented enough to know how society would react PERIOD

I could see this generation being one of the generations that pushes it. clark said PERIOD Generation Z can change and decide. nCAA Bans Celsius
