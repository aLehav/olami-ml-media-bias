Young Democrats Lola Murti disagreed and said that  of Americans believe that abortion should be legal as most of the country is prochoice PERIOD Murti also said  of women must travel over  miles to go to the nearest abortion clinic PERIOD

This does not mean fair access to women all over the country Murti said PERIOD We have a right to privacy meaning that our transportation and ways to get to an abortion clinic should not be tracked and the lack of bodily autonomy in this choice is not something that we support at all. on the topic of inflation College Republicans disapproved of Bidens efforts calling the Inflation Reduction Act the Inflation Expansion Act. they focused on the increase in taxes as Americans are living paycheck to paycheck PERIOD

What Brian Kemp and the Republicans are doing is just letting it sit there Woolsey said PERIOD I dont know if you know with inflation if you just keep your money and not spend on anything thats actually going to decrease its value. the debate ended with closing remarks and each side encouraging the audience to vote PERIOD
