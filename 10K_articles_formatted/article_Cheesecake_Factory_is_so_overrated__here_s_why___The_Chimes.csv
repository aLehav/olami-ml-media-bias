I feel sorry for what Im about to say but The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most overrated experiences someone can have PERIOD

I recently visited to see if I was false or correct in my initial observations and clearly it wasnt the former PERIOD

When I arrived there was no wait and the waitress was very polite PERIOD Unfortunately that is the only positive thing to come from this experience PERIOD

When sitting down and opening the menu I immediately became overwhelmed PERIOD It looks like theyve tried to fit as many words as possible on their menu PERIOD The menu has dishes from egg rolls to quesadillas to southern fried chicken sliders PERIOD

Its obvious The Cheesecake Factory couldnt be bothered to make decisions to create a realthemed menu PERIOD Instead they decided a menu with over  dishes would do the trick PERIOD

After flipping through the twentyseven page menu which excludes the signature SkinnyLicious menu my friends and I found an appetizer we could agree on the warm crab and artichoke dip PERIOD

Within five minutes of putting in our order the waitress came to tell us they were out of the crab and artichoke as well as the spinach and artichoke dip PERIOD Thankfully there were  other dishes to choose from PERIOD

After a long debate that could have been avoided had the menu not been so lengthy we agreed on the eggroll sampler PERIOD The sampler included Avocado Tex Mex Cheeseburger Spring Rolls and Chicken Taquitos PERIOD

I then discovered that no one should ever try to americanize Asian cuisineespecially by trying to make a spring roll taste like a cheeseburger PERIOD Not only was this an insult to Asian cuisine but to American cuisine as well PERIOD

We eventually ordered our entrees fourcheese pasta salmon and chicken piccata that could have been made for  at home and tasted just as good PERIOD This solidified what I already knew PERIOD I will not be eating at The Cheesecake Factory again PERIOD

Why in a thriving city like Columbus would someone decide to eat at The Cheesecake Factory If youre going to spend the money to go out to eat there are much better alternatives PERIOD Ive saved you the trouble and found a couple suggestions myself PERIOD

Forno located in the Short North is a much better alternative PERIOD It has a young energetic atmosphere that offers better food and drinks PERIOD And the best part is their menu is only two pages They also offer weekly happy hour specials that make the experience that much better PERIOD

Marcellas is another alternative PERIOD This Italian restaurant has a clear and obvious menu PERIOD You wont waste your time trying to decide what kind of food youre in the mood for PERIOD This is another place that offers a happy hour PERIOD

These are just a couple of my favorite options in Columbus because its  and we shouldnt have to go to an overpriced overrated chain restaurant for a good meal PERIOD
