4057,2023-11-03,"the losses at home have been narrow for Fresno State. but missed opportunities here and there and secondhalf surges that followed deep firsthalf deficits have left the Bulldogs with a physical demeanor on defense  but without the wins to show for it PERIOD

Against UNLV   MWC Wednesday night at the Save Mart Center the Bulldogs will focus on finishing  at the basket in the paint on the boards PERIOD

What Ive said to our guys is weve got to play for  minutes Fresno State coach Rodney Terry said PERIOD

That starts from the outset of the game to the time that horn goes off PERIOD Its very important this time of year PERIOD You have to finish PERIOD You have to compete and more than anything you have to continue to improve. uNLV which excels under a fast transition offense is led by freshman forward Anthony Bennett who is averaging a teamhigh . points per game for the Rebels PERIOD The Rebels are ranked second among Mountain West schools in scoring averaging  points per game PERIOD

The key to countering the Rebels rapid play on offense Terry said is setting up faster on defense PERIOD

Theyre a team that puts constant pressure on the basket Terry said PERIOD Transition offense is something they really try to do PERIOD Were going to have to get back get our defense set and try to slow those guys in transition PERIOD Theyre a really good offensive rebounding team. there is no doubting that theBulldogs   MWC play physical on defense  Fresno State has a . turnover margin in conference play and has only allowed opponents to score more than  points three times this season PERIOD

But the same defensive physicality that Fresno State thrives under is also the very sword it falls by PERIOD

In conference play the Bulldogs have outfouled opponents  PERIOD

We have to finish better junior guard Kevin Olekaibe said PERIOD

We have to pay attention to detail more PERIOD I think that us being at home we have to bring the energy to the building PERIOD We cant wait for the crowd to get into it PERIOD We just have to do what were told and follow the scouting report PERIOD UNLV is a very good team PERIOD They like to run at a fast pace PERIOD We just have to set our defense and make them play against our set defense. olekaibe making most of minutes

Olekaibe who is coming off one of his best games of the season in a  loss to Air Force is one of the players on the team who has had to adjust to a different role PERIOD

Last season Olekaibe was a scoring machine for Fresno State and was its clear goto option  averaging . points and  minutes per game PERIOD

Against the Falcons on Wednesday night Olekaibe played  minutes and scored  points off the bench shooting 6of12 from behind the 3point arc PERIOD

Before that Olekaibe logged in  minutes at Boise State and six minutes at home against Colorado State PERIOD

KOs been very positive about the role that weve asked him to come in and play Terry said PERIOD

He hasnt shot particularly as well as he probably wanted to in the course of this season but right now hes coming off a really good game where he made shots. olekaibe has started  games this season and is averaging . point per game PERIOD

The junior has seen a recent fluctuation in his minutes but said he is not really frustrated about it. i just have to play my hardest when my name is called and whenever he puts me in Olekaibe said PERIOD From here on out Im just going to give my hardest on offense and defense and try and be the player I was last year and help my team as much as possible PERIOD I know what my role is. braeden Anderson cleared to play

Against the Rebels Fresno State will receive a welcomed addition in frosh forward Braeden Anderson PERIOD

Anderson has been cleared by the NCAA and is eligible to play after not gaining admittance to Kansas as a partial qualifier PERIOD

Anderson joins fellow freshman post players Tanner Giddings and Robert Upshaw as part of a physical presence that will be tasked with guarding UNLVs Bennett PERIOD

The 6foot9 forward will make his career appearance as a Bulldog tonight PERIOD

Weve tried to keep it simple for him Terry said PERIOD Weve said to Braeden Come in and do what youve practiced PERIOD Weve given you a couple of moves in the post PERIOD Just come in and play with a motor PERIOD Give some physicality on both ends of the floor and just play hard. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
