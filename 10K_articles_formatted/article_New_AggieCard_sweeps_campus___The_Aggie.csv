Card now available for freshmen transfer students

Last fall UC Davis students voted on four different designs to determine the look of the newlydesigned AggieCard PERIOD ASUCD President Alex Lees student staff members thirdyear design major Melanie Zelaya and thirdyear communication major Juliana Luna created these four designs which were voted on by  students PERIOD The winning design won with  votes a . percent majority PERIOD

Firstyear and transfer students have since received the newly designed ID cards PERIOD Continuing students will keep using the old cards unless they lose their current AggieCard in which case they have to pay a  replacement fee and will receive the newly designed card PERIOD If replaced an updated photo will also need to be taken due to new photo requirements PERIOD

Undergraduate students can still use their ID cards as a library card membership card to the Activities and Recreation Center and free Unitrans bus pass regardless of whether they have the new or old AggieCard PERIOD

The process to make the designs took eight months PERIOD It required the use of Marketing Toolbox an allaccessible free resource that outlines UC Davis standards to find which designs would work best PERIOD After meeting with Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre the team was put in contact with members from Strategic Communications who introduced senior designers to give feedback and help integrate UC Davis upcoming One of a Kind marketing campaign PERIOD

Besides the aesthetic change to the front of the card the back of the cards design is now more streamlined colorcoordinated and includes the UC Davis Counseling and Psychological Services CAPS phone number PERIOD

You can see how everything in the old card is monocolor and all the contact information is scrunched together Lee said PERIOD The new one is more differentiated PERIOD The new one has a CAPS counseling phone number added PERIOD So the back is now more user friendly  Zelaya and Luna redesigned it so if you needed it in an emergency you could see it more at a glance. zelaya realized during her first year at Davis that she wanted to improve the Aggie ID card PERIOD

As design students were trained to be on the lookout for problems that we see need to be fixed or finding things that could be improved upon Zelaya said PERIOD Right off the bat as a freshman the AggieCard was something I wanted to change PERIOD I saw that it could be improved upon  using my knowledge as a designer. zelaya was inspired to incorporate notable UC Davis landmarks and mascots PERIOD Additionally Lee said that the new AggieCard design was influenced by bank cards to make a more transactional modern and sleek look PERIOD

My roommate told me she thought her coworkers new AggieCard was a credit card when he tried to use a swipe so I guess that means we were successful Zelaya said PERIOD Its a design that has the sleekness and professional aspect we were looking for and yet it is able to communicate a lot of important information on the back as well. lee said that despite the generational gap of new AggieCard design holders versus old design holders there is an overall positive student body reaction to the new card PERIOD

Its certainly a little difficult because of the generation gap Lee said PERIOD When the holders of the new card look at the old cards they think we lucked out but then there are those of us who have the old ones thinking when am I getting mine I definitely think theres a great shift towards it  I think people are really excited to have this new mark of Aggie pride. meghan Garfink a firstyear undeclared major likes the new design PERIOD

It looks good Garfink said PERIOD I think these numbers are useful and it is definitely more aesthetically pleasing. sarah Morrow a firstyear animal biology major especially enjoys that the card fits with the UC colors PERIOD

I do think its more aesthetically pleasing Morrow said PERIOD I really like the school color gradient in the front. zelaya is proud that her AggieCard design has been implemented PERIOD

To anyone who is wondering how we were able to create something that  plus students would use I think its more of a question of how bad you want it Zelaya said PERIOD Nothing is impossible  Ideas can be crazy but theyre never impossible. written by Yvonne Leong  campustheaggie.org
