Welsh Family vs PERIOD Lyons

The No PERIOD  Lions hope to play spoiler and upend the topseeded undefeated Welsh Family when the two teams clash Sunday PERIOD

All season the  Whirlwinds have run down opponents with a balanced attack of overpowering offense and a stifling defense PERIOD

Our success this season has been due to our offense defense coaching and team chemistry Welsh Family captain Kelly Bushelle said PERIOD If the offense struggles we know the defense will step up and vice versa. offensive struggles though have hardly been a problem for the Whirlwinds who average just over  points a game PERIOD Coupled with a dominant Whirlwind defense that has shut out opponents in half of its games the Lions have an uphill climb PERIOD

Despite the daunting task Lyons remains optimistic PERIOD

We plan to come out strong and use what we have been working on in practice to beatWelsh Family Lyons captain Catherine Mackin said PERIOD We are not afraid and we will be ready on Sunday to win. lyons will look for big performances on offense from sophomore quarterback Claire Connell and freshman running back Neva Lundy PERIOD In order to stop the potent Welsh Family offense the Lions will need big games from their defensive core of seniors Judith Kaczmarek and Joanna Collins and junior Shannon Brandy PERIOD The Lions defense has given up an average of . points in six games this season PERIOD

The Lions and Whirlwinds play Sunday at  p.m PERIOD on Riehle Field PERIOD

Pangborn vs PERIOD Cavanaugh

These Phoxes may be young but that doesnt mean they play like it PERIOD

Pangborn led almost entirely by freshman and sophomores enters the playoffs riding a fivegame unbeaten streak it hopes to continue Sunday against Cavanaugh PERIOD

The No PERIOD  seed Phoxes look to rely on a tough defense and strong passing game led by freshman quarterback Gabbie Tate and sophomore receiver Meghan Bescher PERIOD

Bescher has been a key player for Pangborn in all facets of the game PERIOD In her teams last two games against Lewis and BreenPhillips Bescher scored all  Pangborn points PERIOD

To prepare for the playoffs the Phoxes have gone from one practice a week to three hoping to stay fresh despite a twoweek layoff between games PERIOD

Cavanaugh meanwhile hopes to rely on its experience to get into the second round PERIOD

Led by junior quarterback and Katie Dunn and senior receiver Tarah Brom the Chaos also enter the playoffs with momentum having won three of their past four games PERIOD

Weve improved a lot from the beginning of the season Dunn said PERIOD We had momentum at the end of the season and we want to continue that in the playoffs. dunn was confident her team wouldnt be harmed by the long break since its last game PERIOD

It might affect us a little Dunn said PERIOD But weve been scrimmaging in practice and I consider our defense to be pretty strong so I dont think itll affect us too much. in addition to shaking off the rust Dunn was adamant about doing the little things right on Sunday especially extra point plays PERIOD

All the teams are good now so the games will come down to the wire. dunn said PERIOD We struggled with extra points early in the season but weve been working a lot on defending and scoring them. the Chaos though havent made any major changes for the playoffs PERIOD

We know Pangborn is a good team and a fast team Dunn said PERIOD We just have to keep doing what weve been doing. the Phoxes take on Cavanaugh at  p.m PERIOD on Riehle Field PERIOD

Walsh vs PERIOD Farley

The Wild Women will look to keep their undefeated season going Sunday when they face Farley in the opening round of the playoffs PERIOD

Senior captain Marie Brenner expected to see her squad rejuvenated after its week off PERIOD

Were going into the playoff games with a new enthusiasm and excitement in hopes of playing the championship game in the stadium Brenner said PERIOD

However dont expect to see Walsh looking too far ahead PERIOD

Since weve played Farley already once in the season we know that they are tough competition Brenner said PERIOD Despite our high goals we are also playing one game at a time. offensively senior quarterback Mary Sullivan will lead the highpowered Walsh attack PERIOD She will try to connect with sophomore receiver Sierra Smith and sophomore receiver Meghan Hadley PERIOD

While Farley had a tough start to the season junior captain Jenny Rolfs said the Finest have their best days ahead of them PERIOD

We lost a few games that we definitely should have won Rolfs said PERIOD

The Finest have been working hard at addressing some problems that cost them earlier in the season PERIOD In particular Farley has been working on finishing drives in the red zone PERIOD

Farley will once again lean on its strong defense to keep them in the game PERIOD Senior defensive captain Anna Pursley leads the secondary and Brigid McGann will head the linebacking corps PERIOD

Were hoping that our defense can continue to shut down offenses as it has been doing Rolfs said PERIOD

The teams will meet Sunday at  p.m PERIOD at Riehle Field PERIOD

Howard vs PERIOD Pasquerilla West

In a battle between two teams with two losses Howard will take on defending champion Pasquerilla West in the first round of the playoffs Sunday PERIOD

Howard has a record of  with a three game unbeaten streak PERIOD The Ducks however are not overlooking the Purple Weasels PERIOD

PW is definitely a strong opponent senior captain Mary Jenkins said PERIOD I think they are one of the toughest teams we could potentially face in the playoffs PERIOD A win against them would give us a great boost heading into the next round. the Ducks are led on offense by freshman quarterback Kayla Bishop and junior wide receiver Laura Giezeman PERIOD

I could tell at practice that we definitely came back from the break as focused as ever Jenkins said PERIOD We are going to try and mix up our offensive game plan and let Kayla throw it around a little more. junior lineman Kate Sylvia leads a solid defense that will look to shut down the Weasels on Sunday PERIOD

After reevaluating the defense we got great results and are excited with our group heading into this weeks game Jenkins said PERIOD

Despite early season woes Pasquerilla West finished strong by shutting out Badin and clinching its spot in the playoffs PERIOD Senior captain Tina Martinek hopes to lead her team back to the championship game in a repeat performance of last year PERIOD

The key this year for the Weasels will be their talented defense PERIOD The Weasels punched their ticket into the playoffs by shutting out Badin  in the last game of the regular season PERIOD As Pasquerilla Wests  record is misleading as each of its losses came in very close games PERIOD

With the experience of last seasons championship playoff run under their belts the Weasels could make a run at the title PERIOD

Howard plays Pasquerilla West Sunday at  p.m PERIOD on Riehle Field PERIOD
