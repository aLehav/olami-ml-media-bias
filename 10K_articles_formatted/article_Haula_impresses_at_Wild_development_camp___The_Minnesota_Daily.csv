Erik Haula has never been the biggest player on the ice but that has never stopped him PERIOD

A threeyear forward with the Gophers from  Haula has starred at every level of his career despite the occasional size disadvantage PERIOD

Now the 5foot11inch 170pound forward will test his luck at hockeys highest level PERIOD

Haula demonstrated his leadership skills at the Minnesota Wild Development Camp from July  at the Xcel Energy Center PERIOD

I think he made a positive impression with the coaches and everybody involved at the camp said Wild assistant general manager Brent Flahr and thats a good thing for him going forward. haula signed a twoyear deal with the Wild in April  less than two weeks after the Gophers  season abruptly ended with an upset loss to Yale PERIOD

I felt like I was ready to move on to the next level Haula said PERIOD There was a lot of talk with the coaches and family and other people that help me out and I feel like the common theme was everyone felt like I was ready for the next level. haula has the skill set to compete in the NHL but his lack of size will be a greater disadvantage than ever PERIOD

Hes not the biggest body for the NHL so hes going to have to learn all the little things to excel in the early stages of his career Flahr said PERIOD Hes never going to be 6foot4  pounds PERIOD Hes aware of that. this was Haulas third year at the camp but he said he still has a lot to prove PERIOD A handful of notable prospects were in attendance including last years firstround pick Matt Dumba PERIOD

I kind of know the drill but I know Im still competing with a lot of these guys for a spot Haula said PERIOD

The players are on the ice a lot at the camp he said but the experience isnt predicated solely on that PERIOD He said office activities include media training leadership training nutrition speeches and other training events PERIOD

Haula said this training is useful for his development as a player but his main focus is continuing to improve his strength PERIOD

Flahr said he recognizes Haulas worked to increase his size since his freshman year with the Gophers and the growth is evident PERIOD He said Haula was a clear leader at the camp and those intangible skills could outweigh his lack of size PERIOD

Haula was extremely vocal in the threeonthree scrimmage at the camp July  and led his group with a sense of passion reminiscent of last season with the Gophers PERIOD

Haula looked like a quality NHL prospect at the camp and was right at the top of the list Flahr said PERIOD He came in and worked hard and was a good example for the guys that were coming in for the first time. haula said he knows he has a lot to learn to compete in the NHL but his short stint with the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League this spring helped his growth PERIOD

Haula led the Gophers with  points last year but said the AHL was a different beast PERIOD

I know I have to get better because the jump from college to AHL is somewhat big and the jump to NHL is even bigger Haula said PERIOD

Wild general manager Chuck Fletcher spoke highly of Haula two weeks ago on KFAN and entertained the idea that Haula could be a dark horse to win the secondline center spot on the Wild next season PERIOD

Flahr said position battles and roster spots will play themselves out in time but said hes confident Haula has a future in the NHL PERIOD

Hes coming here to make an impression with the coaches and earn a spot in the lineup Flahr said PERIOD We have a number of young players vying for similar spots and similar roles and hes right in the mix there. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
