Student body president Brett Rocheleau began this weeks Student Senate meeting by reminding students to be especially safe this weekend especially for Saturdays night football game PERIOD

Tell everyone who is underage in your halls that they are really not allowed to drink Rocheleau said PERIOD The Excise Police will be out this weekend and hopefully nothing major happens. rocheleau also discussed a Campus Life Council meeting he attended earlier this week PERIOD

We had a really good discussion focusing on consistency across dorms Rocheleau said PERIOD Our first meeting defined these inconsistencies and next time we plan to delve into solutions. student body vice president Katie Rose continued by thanking Senate members for attending last Fridays Robinson Community Learning Center RCLC picnic PERIOD

The RCLC picnic was a blast Rose said PERIOD It was the highest attendance of students and community members weve ever seen. rose attended a Community Campus Action Coalition meeting in Rocheleaus absence this week and heard from community members about offcampus student interactions PERIOD

Overall things are okay although property crimes are still pretty consistent PERIOD Offcampus parties are still a problem PERIOD Make sure you remind your friends living offcampus to be respectful of their neighbors Rose said PERIOD Also to reinforce what Brett said earlier be safe this weekend PERIOD Excise Police have doubled their force for the night game to make sure everything is under control. chief of staff Katie Baker informed the Senate of a new Student Union Board committee being formed for diversity in residence halls PERIOD

The purpose of the new committee is to make sure everyone feels welcome in their dorms from the minute they step foot on campus to the minute they leave four years later Baker said PERIOD The group is specifically for transfer students international students  anyone who needs help adjusting and feeling at home. next the Senate voted in favor of a resolution thanking the Office of Housing for funding hydration stations in each residence hall brought in by Parker Dwyer director of residence life for Senate PERIOD

The final order of business was the approval of a resolution brought forth by Matt Devine director of gender studies for Senate PERIOD The resolution recognized the establishment of gender issues subcommittees PERIOD

Pangborn senator Emily Pollard described further what this resolution involves PERIOD

Having subcommittees just breaks the committee of gender studies down so people can look at things more specifically Pollard said PERIOD It allows everybody to focus in on certain issues so we can help to the best of our abilities. baker said the cabinet discussed this resolution Tuesday and described it as more of public relations move than a final resolution PERIOD

The point is really to keep the Senate and the student body informed so everyone knows where to go if they need help Baker said PERIOD
