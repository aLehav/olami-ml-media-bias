UPDATE On Feb PERIOD  The Texas AM Judicial Court argued and decided the case of Cabreras disqualification and upheld Schaffers decision to disqualify Cabrera from the student body president race PERIOD

The majority opinion states 

Following an appeal filed on Thursday Feb. David Cabrera a political science junior has entered the race for student body president PERIOD

Cabrera filed to run for the leadership position before the mandatory filing date on Friday Feb PERIOD  and was informed on Feb PERIOD  he had been disqualified from the election PERIOD

On Tuesday night  around  I got an email that I got disqualified from the race because I did not have a . gPA last semester Cabrera said PERIOD

In the fall of  Cabrera started the semester as a fulltime student but said he was forced to withdraw from Texas AM due to what the university considers too many unexcused absences PERIOD These unexcused absences were a reflection of immigration issues Cabrera was facing PERIOD Following difficulties with his visa he was required to go back to his hometown in Ecuador during the semester PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD Embassy told me I was still in processing and they did not even know what it was all about PERIOD  Even today I dont know what took so long Cabrera said PERIOD

Although Cabrera was able to complete online assignments the university did not allow him to take his inperson exams in any other format leading to what he said was his inevitable failure in the classes PERIOD Cabrera withdrew from the university soon after PERIOD

I was taking one online class but I was also taking inperson lectures Cabrera said PERIOD The problem is that the university does not excuse absences with visas. according to Student Rule  excused absences only apply to the following reasons

Personal injury or illness that is too severe or contagious for the student to attend class death or major illness in a students immediate family illness of a dependent family member participation in legal or governmental proceedings that require a students presence and that cannot be rescheduled graduate or professional school interviews which are mandatory interviews for permanent fulltime employment or fulltime internship presentation of research or scholarship at a professional conference related to the students academic program participation in an activity appearing on the university authorized activity list mandatory participation as a studentathlete in NCAAsanctioned competition or an excuse sanctioned by the dean of the students college. once Cabrera returned to the United States in December the university administration made an exception and allowed him to return in the following semester PERIOD However withdrawing from AM left Cabrera with no GPA for the fall semester disqualifying him from the initial eligibility check taken after candidate filing closed PERIOD

In opposition to his disqualification Cabrera filed an appeal stating he had special circumstances and would like to challenge the decision of the election commissioner PERIOD According to Shefali Chopra chief justice of the Student Government Association Judicial Court and accounting junior the appeal was filed on Thursday and the acceptance of the appeal took place that same night PERIOD She said the earliest a hearing can take place after filing is  hours but due to scheduling conflicts it could not be scheduled until Wednesday Feb  PERIOD

In order to have his name on the ballot Cabrera was required to attend the mandatory candidate meeting on Sunday PERIOD However because the hearing was scheduled for the following week Cabrera filed an injunction PERIOD This injunction was passed with a majority vote from the justices and halted what was disqualifying him until the appeal hearing and allowed him to attend the meeting PERIOD

As of right now the court is taking a very neutral standpoint because we have not had an appeal hearing yet Chopra said PERIOD We are not siding with one side or the other we are taking the necessary actions we feel. the Judicial Court will hear both Cabreras and the election commissioners side and make a decision on Wednesday evening PERIOD This hearing will be held in private due to sensitive information in the case and the chief justice is unsure when the verdict will be public knowledge PERIOD
