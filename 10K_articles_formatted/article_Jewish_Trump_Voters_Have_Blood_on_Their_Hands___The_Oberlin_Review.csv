Editors note This article contains mention of antiSemitism and gun violence PERIOD

I have been trying to escape Judaism for a long time PERIOD As a child I hated the services my parents schlepped me along to  they were boring in a language I didnt know and involved a lot of standing PERIOD Early in my teens I braced against my Hebrew school teachers PERIOD They all seemed convinced that Israel could not be criticized whatsoever for its violence in retaliation to rocket attacks no matter how many innocent civilians were killed PERIOD Later in high school I completely rejected God identifying passionately as an atheist PERIOD

When I got to college though it was different PERIOD Suddenly knowledge of the Holocaust was not a given I encountered open hostility toward Jews and found the identity I tried so hard to leave behind constantly invalidated at the expense of myself and my loved ones PERIOD Instead of fighting my grandmothers Islamophobia and my synagogues ingrained bigotry my battle in college was against the antiSemitism of my peers and the intolerance of my institution no matter how hard I tried escaping Judaism I ended up having to defend it PERIOD

So Ive lived a double life one I created for myself to make it easier to get by PERIOD At home Im an atheist and a radical liberal PERIOD I advocate for Palestinian liberation call out my familys Islamophobia and try to unpack my own and stay as far away as possible from organized religion PERIOD At Oberlin however Im Jewish PERIOD I try to explain that yes it is possible to be a Zionist and also support Palestinian liberation PERIOD I attend community events as much as I feel comfortable and I vent to my Jewish friends about how we feel on campus PERIOD

I wish I didnt have to do that but the Jewish people have never had the privilege of escaping their tormentors and I am no different PERIOD Shrugging off my Judaism is a privilege I can never have and the murders of  congregants at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill   of my people  is just another reminder of that PERIOD

Depressingly what shocks and infuriates me about the deaths in Squirrel Hill is not the murders themselves PERIOD I have been told stories of death since I was a child watching elderly men weep as they recounted hearing the gunshots from the SS executing little boys in the woods PERIOD Nor am I so shaken by the gun violence for we live in the midst of so much gun violence and inaction on gun control  after all this is America where about  Americans are killed with guns each day PERIOD

No PERIOD The worst thing about these murders is that there are many fellow Jews among us who are responsible about a quarter of all Jewish voters in fact PERIOD They voted for Donald Trump PERIOD

He as Republicans do promised them unwavering support of the state of Israel and moving the U.S PERIOD embassy to the contested area of Jerusalem and they paid careful attention to those promises PERIOD But he also promised a policy of racism antiSemitism Islamophobia and hate which they blissfully ignored PERIOD The Squirrel Hill murders are the result PERIOD

If you dont believe me you can simply check the shooters social media page where he directly cited the Presidents false statements about a migrant caravan as the reason he targeted Tree of Life which sponsors migrants through an organization called Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society PERIOD Following Trumps election in  antiSemitic attacks increased by  percent in  PERIOD

The funny thing about Judaism is that it is a very small religion  less than two percent of Americans identify as Jewish and the number is even smaller globally PERIOD As a kid it always seemed to me that the quirks of Judaism were structured around that small size and there was an intense pressure against leaving the faith PERIOD My parents were strictly cautioned about marrying out of the religion and my Hebrew school teachers drilled in the same message PERIOD But if we are so obsessed with ensuring our own survival why do some of us support a president who openly endangers it

Critics will argue that I should not speak so harshly or politicize the dead that I should not disrupt the grief felt within the Jewish community PERIOD That may have been true once PERIOD

But the problem is that these murders are political PERIOD Being Jewish and supporting the President without being called out for it is a privilege that people dont get to have anymore PERIOD We as a religious community must get over our fear of speaking out if we ever want to end our own persecution and stop enabling it ourselves PERIOD

We also cannot ignore that our struggle against persecution is intimately tied up with that of other communities PERIOD Just a few days prior to the murders in Pittsburgh a white supremacist murdered two Black people in a Kentucky Kroger PERIOD I had no idea until after Pittsburgh and neither did my family PERIOD We must do better than that PERIOD

Squirrel Hill is not a oneoff PERIOD Both in terms of guns and antiSemitism it is part of a burgeoning phenomenon in America in which violence and hate increasingly combine and result in murders like these PERIOD We saw it in Charleston PERIOD We saw it in Charlottesville PERIOD And we have seen it so many other times PERIOD Undoubtedly this hate has festered for years stretching long before  PERIOD But it was released with the Republican partys embrace of extremism and that embrace was led by Donald Trump PERIOD

We cannot escape our Judaism and we cannot escape the fact that some of us now have blood on our hands PERIOD Jews cannot keep living double lives in which we allow our conservative peers relatives and friends to get away with supporting such a hateful president and party without having to be accountable PERIOD We have to do more than hold vigils and be sad  we have to broach the uncomfortable political subjects with our family members ask them who they voted for and knock on doors PERIOD We have to call our rabbis and pressure them to give sermons about social justice racial justice and voting especially when the congregants dont want to hear it PERIOD We must say the victims names and do all that we can to make sure that the next time this happens to us  its only a matter of when  that our president didnt enable it PERIOD
