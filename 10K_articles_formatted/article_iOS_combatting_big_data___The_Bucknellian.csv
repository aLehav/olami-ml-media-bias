Have you ever searched something on the internet and within  hours got an ad for that same product This practice called ad tracking has caused millions of consumers to express unease with the state of their privacy PERIOD In response Apple is implementing serious new rules regarding privacy concerns with its iOS  operating system PERIOD Although these policies did intensify slightly with iOS  these new systems give consumers the ability to decide to turn off ad tracking within their settings PERIOD When apps are downloaded through the App Store users will receive a notification asking whether or not these apps can track them PERIOD These new capabilities grant users much more privacy and independence going forward PERIOD By having the power to see which apps track them how they conduct tracking and what data is collected iOS  ultimately offers users a greater sense of control PERIOD

Many people fear tracking capabilities via the internet but some companies have concerns over losing their ability to directly engage with consumers PERIOD The restraints placed by Apple are a direct threat to companies such as Google and Facebook who use ad tracking with every consumer to grow business and create a personalized media experience PERIOD Many other businesses are media based on ad tracking as their sole line of work PERIOD Initially the deficiency of ad tracking will hurt Google and Facebook but will dwindle to these smaller companies PERIOD In the future it will force people to question where their information is going and how it is being used therefore hurting all businesses that rely on ad tracking PERIOD However what is more important the privacy of the consumer or the benefits that tracking brings to big businesses

Aside from Google and Facebooks concerns Apples restrictions on tracking could be a step in the right direction PERIOD Apple plans on promoting this privacy standard everywhere even lessening their own small company that focuses on ad tracking PERIOD Users still have the choice to keep ad tracking on so the market will decrease but may not diminish completely PERIOD

The largest intention for ad tracking is to benefit the consumer so shouldnt the decision be in the hands of the consumer Sometimes ad tracking does not contribute to the overall experience oftentimes it distracts or agitates the user PERIOD Yes with ad tracking users may have the capability to see ads based on their interests but oftentimes it is found to be invasive PERIOD Over the last  years mobile advertising has advanced drastically which has certainly increased its effectiveness but has also given rise to the ability to recover things as personal as a consumers political leanings housing status and job history PERIOD The idea of ones entire private life being revealed with the touch of a button is a fear held by many PERIOD Within this weird time of nonprivate media some will say that what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone is a tempting offer PERIOD
