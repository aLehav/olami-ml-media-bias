MADRID AP  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honored Wednesday to learn she had been named Times youngest Person of the Year saying the accolade deserved to be shared by others in the global movement she helped inspire PERIOD

The 16yearold Swede has become the face of a new generation of activists drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half PERIOD Some have welcomed her activism including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming PERIOD But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone PERIOD

For sounding the alarm about humanitys predatory relationship with the only home we have for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads Greta Thunberg is TIMEs  Person of the Year the media franchise said on itswebsite PERIOD

Leaving a U.N PERIOD climate conference in Madrid Thunberg told The Associated Press she was a bit surprised at the recognition PERIOD

I could never have imagined anything like that happening she said in a phone interview PERIOD

Im of course very grateful for that very honored Thunberg said but added that it should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done we have done together. thunberg said she was hopeful that the message being pushed by her and other activists  that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change  is finally getting through PERIOD

But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists particularly indigenous people who she said are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis and to the science around global warming PERIOD

That is what I am trying to do to use my platform to do she said PERIOD

Thunberg said the movement which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people had managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently reduce planetwarming greenhouse gas emissions and help those already affected by climate change PERIOD

To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward she said PERIOD That I think is our biggest success. asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message Thunberg said They say they listen and they say they understand but it sure doesnt seem like it. if they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action she added PERIOD

She said the experience of the past  months going from soloprotester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the U.N PERIOD General Assembly had changed her PERIOD

I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact she said PERIOD

Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest shes received from media and adoring fans in recent months PERIOD

She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford PERIOD

I would like to be left alone Thunberg said when asked about her plans for the next days PERIOD She will later travel home to Sweden to spend Christmas with her family and dogs she added PERIOD

After that I have no school to return to until August because Ive taken a gap year she said PERIOD

I will probably continue a bit like now travel around PERIOD And if I get invitations to come PERIOD And just try everything I can she added PERIOD

Earlier Wednesday Thunbergaddressed negotiatorsat the U.N.s annual climate talks warning that almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR. last years Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis Maryland where five people were shot to death Philippine journalist Maria Ressa and two Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo PERIOD
