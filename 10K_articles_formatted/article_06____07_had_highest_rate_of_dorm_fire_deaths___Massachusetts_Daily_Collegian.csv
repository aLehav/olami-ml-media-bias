Going to college marks an important milestone and the CPSC doesnt want that to be marred by a potentially tragic fire said acting CPSC chairman Nancy Nord PERIOD Students bring things from home to make dorm life more comfortable including highpowered electronics and appliances PERIOD These items can make life easier but also more dangerous when used improperly or left unsupervised particularly in small dorm rooms. on August  the CPSC U.S PERIOD Fire Administration National Fire Protection Association and the University of Marylands fire marshal urged students parents administrators and resident assistants to be aware of fire dangers in a joint press conference PERIOD

According to the CPSC fires in college housing are most common during the evening and weekends when students are in their residences PERIOD And while most of the fires are cookingrelated hot plates microwaves portable grills etc. the majority of fire deaths occur in the bedroom PERIOD

The CPSC and NFPA ultimately recommended six main college dorm fire safety tips PERIOD

Secondly most deaths and injuries occur in sleeping areas and are associated with smoking materials like tobacco products candles and incense PERIOD Students should always extinguish flames before leaving the room or going to sleep PERIOD

Electrical products portable heaters and lighting such as halogen lamps are the source of a large number of dorm fires PERIOD Students are recommended to keep combustibles away from heat sources and not to overload electrical outlets extension cords and power strips PERIOD

Layers of old paint on dormitory walls in many cases contribute to their flammability PERIOD The Boston Globe reported last month about a Massachusetts company that makes fireresistant coatings which is already being used on the UMass Lowell campus PERIOD

Dormitories are repainted every year and some of these dorms are  or  or  years old so weve got paint thats built up and is a natural source of fuel for a fire said Bob Pliskin vice president of sales for Bradford Industries PERIOD Pliskin went on to note that the companys PyroTarp paint can cover layers of old paint so they dont easily turn into fuel for a fire PERIOD UMass Lowell has used the paint on many of its new lab buildings and on renovations of older timberbased buildings PERIOD
