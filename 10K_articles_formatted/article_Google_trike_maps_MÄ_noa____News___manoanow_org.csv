A year and a half after Hawaii fi rst appeared in Google Street
View UH campuses are now being mapped by the Google trike which
can access lesserknown roads and paths PERIOD

Beginning with the University of Hawaii at Mnoa the Google
Street View trike  a 250pound ninefoot humanpowered machine 
has been mapping Hawaiis colleges and state parks PERIOD

Google Street View allows users to view images that Street View
trikes cars and snowmobiles capture of streets schools hikes
zoos and anything else that Google Maps users want to see on the
site PERIOD

 said Colin
Macdonald an instructor at UH who Google contacted about mapping
the campus PERIOD

The Street View team in Hawaii has already finished mapping the
UH campus including the Lyon Arboretum the aquarium in Waikk
and the athletic complex PERIOD

 said Macdonald PERIOD

The Google Trike has eight cameras GPS and lasers which make
it easier to accurately place the images PERIOD The pictures are put
together in a 360degree view blending together the overlapping
elements that are created between the eight cameras PERIOD This process
as well as the steps that Google takes to protect peoples privacy
means that it takes a while before the images are ready to be
uploaded to Google Maps PERIOD

 said
Macdonald PERIOD 

This mapping can aid students in navigating the campus PERIOD

 said Macdonald PERIOD

The Street View trike is scheduled to leave Oahu some time in
July and either head over to Maui or the Big Island and finish in
Kauai PERIOD They hope to map Mauna Kea and the observatories on
Klauea PERIOD
