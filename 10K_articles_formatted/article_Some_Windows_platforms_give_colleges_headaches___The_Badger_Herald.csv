2850,2002-11-11,"after dealing with worms viruses and other computer problems last year the University of California at Santa Barbara recently decided to ban students on the network from using specific Microsoft operating systems PERIOD

Use of Windows  and Windows NT . is now prohibited for students on the network however the ban is not campuswide PERIOD The systems are still in use in other parts of the institution where there is a more controlled corporate environment PERIOD

After the University of California made complaints regarding Microsofts software the Microsoft Corporation insisted the problems were specific to the university and had resulted from the way its network is configured PERIOD

Santa Barbaras struggles with Windows  reflect the vagaries of its own network not any flaws in the operating system said John Dubois a member of Microsofts educationsolutions group PERIOD

However according to Curtis Kline Santa Barbaras residential network coordinator only about  of the networks  computers ran Windows  last year but most of the security breaches were traced to those computers PERIOD

Kline blames the issues on the problems students may have in setting up the systems PERIOD The systems default security settings can confuse users and in turn make them set up their machines in ways allowing hackers to access the users computer without a password PERIOD

Due to these problems UCSB has suggested that students purchase Windows XP Home or XP Professional for their computers PERIOD Both of these systems are strongly recommended and sold in the universitys bookstore because they are easier to set up properly and therefore more difficult to breach according to Kline PERIOD

Michelle Souza a senior at UCSB said she is unhappy about the recommendation PERIOD

I really dont have the money to buy a new computer program right now she said PERIOD

The University of Wisconsin has also experienced problems with these systems however a policy of this sort has not been adopted PERIOD

According to Brian Rust UW Division of Information Technologys communications manager problems occurred about a year ago when the Klez virus and other viruses hit their peak PERIOD

One way UW addresses these problems is by the licensing and largescale distribution of Norton antivirus software rather than banning a particular operating system Rust said PERIOD

Other precautions that UW takes are regularly and continuously letting departments and students know what they can and should do to keep viruses off their computers PERIOD One way of doing this was DoITs production of an antivirus video that is shown to new students PERIOD

DoIT also makes Microsoft patches and fixes readily available to the campus and helps remove viruses from infected computers as well as restore the data originally on the computer PERIOD

About half of our faculty and staff and about  percent of our students are using Windows  without serious problems PERIOD We probably owe most of our success to licensing and effective use of Norton Antivirus Rust said PERIOD

Many universities have had similar problems and like UW have applied antivirus scanning and deletion at the server level and on the desktop to protect their networks PERIOD
