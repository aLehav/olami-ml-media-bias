COACHELLA INSPIRED STYLE TIPS FOR COLGATES SPRING PARTY WEEKEND 
After brutal exams and long work days many Colgate students are looking forward to this semesters upcoming events during Spring Party Weekend SPW PERIOD As we all know SPW is that time of the semester when we can all let loose before the storm of research projects and exams PERIOD However what most people dont realize is that Spring Party Weekend is also the time where students make the most fashion statements PERIOD So dont let yourself just become a mess during this SPW PERIOD Instead turn up on Colgates campus with some style PERIOD Like most if youre totally lost on what to wear for this years SPW hopefully this article will provide you with some Coachellabased fashion tips that will help generate inspiration for this years look PERIOD Cant we make Spring Party Weekend Colgates very own Coachella
Style Tip  Rock Color and Different Patterns
Its not a secret that springtime on Colgates campus for some people can just mean crop tops shorts and a Patagonia PERIOD However to help break away from this homogenity you can add some colorful layers to that crop top or even experiment with different types of patterns with your shorts skirts and tops PERIOD Florals and other bohemian patterns are also popular especially around the springtime PERIOD
Style Tip  Add Statement Pieces to Simple Outfits
Definitely add a statement piece to your outfit PERIOD As Teen Vogue pointed out a few days ago there are ways to add style while avoiding past years incidents PERIOD Different types of statement pieces like necklaces bracelets or even mini colorful purses have the ability to take a very simple outfit such as a black crop top with jean shorts and elevate it PERIOD Small purses also have a bit of practicality to them besides looking cute because you can carry important stuff like your cellphone gatecard and whatever else you need to survive the long weekend PERIOD With all these creative ideas in mind remember that there are ways to dress up on campus without offending different cultures on campus PERIOD 
Style Tip  Sneakers are a Yes
During SPW were all familiar with Converse and sandals as favorable footwear options for Greek Life events and climbing up the hills of Hamilton when the cruiser comes twenty minutes late again PERIOD For those who want that same comfort for the same price Vans and Adidas never seem to go out of style PERIOD Not to mention you can still get them just as dirty this weekend and be ready for whatever comes your way next Friday night PERIOD So try something new and switch up your shoe options while still getting lit for this years performance of ILoveMakonnen and Jidenna PERIOD
Style Tip  Definitely Use Sunglasses
If its a sunny day out not only are you doing yourself a favor by using sunglasses to protect your eyes from the UV rays but they can also give a more rebellious feel to any typical outfit PERIOD The best thing about sunglasses is that you dont have to just stick to the classic aviator shades PERIOD Change it up by using different types of frame shapes and colorful or reflective lenses PERIOD Pick the shade that best suites your personal style because the variety of options are endless PERIOD
Style Tip  Its Never Wrong to Be Cozy
Honestly if youre not really into the whole fashion trendscene on and off campus theres nothing wrong with rocking sweatpantsjoggers and plain tshirts.The most important thing to keep in mind is that the goal of SPW is to have fun so when picking out your outfits you can try to keep it as comfortable and lightweight as possible by dressing up your favorite grey sweatpants with white Vans or any other sneakers you feel good in PERIOD Whether youre into patterns and accessories or baggy jumpsuits this spring Colgates Spring Party Weekend has nothing to do with following the latest trends and everything to do with chilling with friends and having a good time
