By  Brian ThomasOctober  

When looking at the Huskies statistics through their first four MAC games one statistic stands out as a reason for their success turnovers PERIOD

Early in the season NIU   MAC struggled to maintain possession of the ball as in its four games against nonconference teams it turned the ball over seven times PERIOD

Looking at the turnovers in the early goings junior quarterback Jordan Lynch was the culprit of most of the turnovers as he had one or more turnovers in each of the first four games PERIOD

Lynch lost three fumbles two of them in the game against Army and in three consecutive games he threw an interception PERIOD

Since then Lynch has been mistakefree not throwing an interception or losing a fumble during MAC play PERIOD He has put the ball on the ground twice but has been able to recover both times maintaining possession for the Huskies PERIOD

With Lynchs turnovers going down turnovers for the Huskies as a team have also gone down PERIOD In four MAC games they have only turned the ball over four times all of which have been fumbles PERIOD

Sophomore TommyLee Lewis lost two fumbles against Ball State PERIOD The other two fumbles came late in games like when junior safety Nate McNeal fumbled a punt against Buffalo and when red shirt freshman quarterback Matt McIntosh fumbled in the final seconds of the game against Akron PERIOD

On the other side of the ball the defense has stepped up its game and forced a number of turnovers during MAC play PERIOD

In the Huskies first four nonconference games the defense was quiet forcing a total of three turnovers PERIOD Those three takeaways all came against Tennessee Martin as senior safety Jimmie Ward recorded an interception and the Huskies recorded two fumble recoveries PERIOD

In NIUs last four games against MAC opponents it has recorded  turnovers PERIOD They have recovered five fumbles and intercepted six passes PERIOD Two of those came from true freshman cornerback Marlon Moore against Buffalo PERIOD

Turnovers have played a huge part in the Huskies success on both sides of the ball PERIOD Offensively the Huskies have been able to hold onto the ball while the defense has forced numerous turnovers both of which set up the offense for more scoring opportunities PERIOD
