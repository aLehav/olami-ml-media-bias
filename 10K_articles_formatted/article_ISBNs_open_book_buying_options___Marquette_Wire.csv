3223,2023-11-04,"for those students who have yet to purchase their books this semester for fear of wiping out their bank account worry not PERIOD For the first time in addition to book titles and authors being listed ISBNs have been added to BookMarqs Web site ensuring students can find the exact text their class requires if shopping somewhere other than BookMarq PERIOD

This change is in accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act which was signed into law in August  by then President George W PERIOD Bush PERIOD Section  of the act requires all universities provide ISBNs so students can find the most affordable textbooks available PERIOD

The law becomes enforceable in July  but Marquette has taken the proactive step of issuing ISBNs starting this semester PERIOD

According to the act the purpose  is to ensure that students have access to affordable course materials by decreasing costs to students and enhancing transparency and disclosures with respect to the selection purchase sale and use of course materials. david Konkol BookMarq manager said the change was an enhancement to its system PERIOD

The aim of our transparency effort and this upcoming requirement is to bring as much information to our students so they can make the best educational decisions he said PERIOD

Students are able to use ISBNs to compare book prices from numerous outlets including offcampus stores like Sweeneys College Books and Web book suppliers like Chegg.com and Amazon.com PERIOD

Competition isnt new Konkol said PERIOD Ultimately competition is great for students and keeps us sharp in the goods and services we provide. colleen King a sophomore in the College of Arts  Sciences said she compared prices at different online suppliers PERIOD

This semester it was easier for me to find cheaper books King said PERIOD Usually there was not a huge difference but I saved more money than if I had just bought all my books from BookMarq. charles Schmidt public relations director for the National Association of College Stores a trade organization connected with Marquettes bookstore believes the publication of ISBNs will have little to no effect on BookMarq PERIOD

ISBN numbers with textbooks are not actually as accurate as they once were because of bundling he said PERIOD Sometimes publishers will charge as much for one book as a bundle would cost at a campus bookstore. many professors package books together in order to ensure that students are covering all angles of a subject PERIOD These books from BookMarq come wrapped together upon purchase PERIOD The bundle contains textbooks and supplemental materials all sold at one price through a college bookstore PERIOD

Many students still prefer to compare prices on single items PERIOD In addition to searching for the cheapest books online students are exploring other options for class materials PERIOD

For instance Denmarkbased BookBoon provides free textbooks online PERIOD The company reports more than  million book  downloads annually PERIOD The catch is that the online content is written exclusively for the  Web site by experts employed by the company rather than electronic versions of existing textbooks PERIOD While it might not be the  exact text a teacher requires it is supplemental material that is completely free PERIOD

Students can not only download our books form our site but they can also be downloaded directly via Facebook through a Facebook app said E.A PERIOD Blake Bookboon.com sales manager in an email PERIOD
