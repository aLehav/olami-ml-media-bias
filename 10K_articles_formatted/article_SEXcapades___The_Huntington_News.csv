My boyfriend and I practically live together at this point PERIOD We spend five to seven nights out of the week together at his apartment with his notsofriendly roommates PERIOD

Ever since we first started dating one of his roommates has confronted us several times about our nighttime and morning and afternoon activities saying that we were too loud PERIOD This roommates room is right across a narrow hallway but the problem isnt with our volume PERIOD Its with the roommates habit of leaving their door open sitting on their bed without music or television for background noise and flatout listening to us PERIOD

How would I know this person does this

One of them told my boyfriend he sits on his bed and listen to us having sex PERIOD

I feel like a loser that I dont have anyone he said PERIOD

I wish I were kidding about this guy PERIOD

One of the roommates downstairs that is more understanding a lot more hes like a saint just laughs it off PERIOD

Yeah I can hear everything PERIOD I turn the TV louder PERIOD Yeah my room shakes violently PERIOD I just close the lazy boy. but were no strangers to outside access to our acts PERIOD

One weekend we decided a little morning jump in the hot tub could be fun PERIOD

It was  a.m PERIOD on a sunny day in a small town and no less than three houses had a view of quite the show in the hot tub PERIOD
