436,2023-10-23,"when Utah power forward Kyle Kuzma first committed to be a Ute there was a lot of buzz surrounding him PERIOD The former fourstar prep athlete from Flint Mich PERIOD surrendered his senior season in high school to join the Runnin Utes as an early enrollee a move that Ute centerinwaiting Jayce Johnson adopted getting an early jump on his collegiate career PERIOD

Though he wasnt able to play during this time period he practiced with the team building up his strength and knowledge of the game at the next level PERIOD Expectations were raised even higher for Kuzma but during Utahs Sweet Sixteen run in  he didnt meet them PERIOD

There were many instances during the  campaign where fellow thenfreshman Brekkott Chapman would be given the nod by Ute head coach Larry Krystkowiak opting to leave Kuzma on the bench PERIOD Thats not to say he didnt contribute but Kuzma only averaged . minutes and . points per game last season  not eyepopping numbers PERIOD

Chapman was expected to solidify his role as the starting fourspot during the offseason but much to the surprise of Utah fans it was Kuzma who started getting his name called with the starting lineups once this season began PERIOD

And he didnt disappoint PERIOD Though it was against inferior talent in SUU Kuzma kicked off the campaign with a 23point 12rebound performance and Utah fans got a glimpse of what the sophomore is capable of in the seasonopening game PERIOD

Hes come up big in a number of other games this season as well PERIOD Against Duke at Madison Square Garden in December he finished with an important  points in the overtime victory PERIOD And in a fourgame stretch extending from January to February the power forward finished with    and  points respectively PERIOD

But in the last four games combined Kuzma has been in a slump scoring just  points during that span PERIOD That was his worst fourgame stretch of the season and if the Utes were to have any success in the Pac12 tournament this weekend Kuzma needed to flip the switch PERIOD

Luckily for the Utes he did just that PERIOD In his biggest contest as a starter  a doordie situation in the conference tournament  the sophomore forward stepped up in the biggest way possible scoring  points on a nearperfect shooting night 11for12 from the field PERIOD He also added seven rebounds and was a strong presence in the post beside Pac12 Player of the Year and future NBA lottery pick in Jakob Poeltl PERIOD

His brightest moment came with  left in the game when USC was creeping back PERIOD Up by two points at  point guard Brandon Taylor found Kuzma in the corner behind the threepoint line PERIOD The sophomore squared up rose up and drained the shot  his ninth field goal of the game  to put the Utes up by five in a critical moment PERIOD

This past week in practice I made an extra focus to play hard and try to do the little things right Kuzma said after the game PERIOD Its good karma. kuzma is a grinder PERIOD Ever since hes stepped foot on campus hes been working tirelessly to become a better player and eventually maybe a nextlevel talent PERIOD When you say that out loud some might be thinking Kuzma a professional player  really

Well yeah why not He firmly believes he can develop into that type of player and draft analysts across the nation are starting to take notice PERIOD Mike Schmitz a video scout for DraftExpress.com tweeted out on his account on Feb PERIOD  that Kuzma is one of the most underrated prospects in the country and I tend to agree with him PERIOD

Before his time is up on the hill Kuzma will leave his mark on this Utah program PERIOD In fact I think he will be a star PERIOD Once the seniors and Poeltl leave this years team to move on to bigger and better things Kuzma will be the prime candidate to take over this Ute squad PERIOD

And I think hes thinking the same thing PERIOD
