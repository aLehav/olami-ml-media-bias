Disappointment  the word most often written in emails to the OColly concerning our main story Monday PERIOD  was the question most often asked PERIOD



The story simply pointed out three events that occurred over a oneyear period involving Vernand Morency PERIOD He was accused of sexual assault in early  and Payne County District Attorney Robert Hudson declined to file charges in spring  PERIOD



Morency was arraigned on charges of receiving stolen property in April  served a deferred sentence and had the record expunged in spring  PERIOD



And in July  Morency filed a civil lawsuit against two university officials to maintain his status as a student and an athlete at Oklahoma State University PERIOD That lawsuit was dismissed just two weeks ago a little more than a week after the OCollegian began asking questions about it PERIOD



The records in that case were permanently sealed when the case was dismissed and the fact that they were sealed in the first case is what sparked the OCollegians interest in the story PERIOD



It was during the investigation of the civil lawsuit that the OCollegian came across the search warrant outlining the earlier accusation which had never been reported PERIOD



If read as it was written no blame was ever placed upon Morency PERIOD The OCollegian did not accuse anyone of anything PERIOD All that was reported were the documents found via the Oklahoma Open Records Act PERIOD All fairness was given in the details and reports from the documents PERIOD All involved were given ample opportunity to respond and offer their view PERIOD Despite that all but District Attorney Rob Hudson declined to offer comment which was itself limited PERIOD



Other readers have suggested the story should not have run because it was too old and therefore not newsworthy PERIOD However when the story ran the civil case had been dismissed only  days earlier PERIOD The earlier accusation was reported in the search warrant which was recently found PERIOD



At the time any Oklahoman had the right to obtain the same document our reporter did PERIOD Our reporter was doing what he was supposed to do  follow a lead until the story was finished PERIOD



The story concerned the policies of the university PERIOD Had the same series of events happened with any OSU student and the same courses of action were taken the story would remain as it was printed PERIOD The truth was being obscured from Oklahomans who are entitled to have access to court records and other documents of the like PERIOD



And much like reporters are a check and balance to systems and governments that affect people every day reporters too have their own system of checks and balances PERIOD There are laws to protect the privacy of individuals to ensure the greatest measure of accuracy in stories and prevent undue harm to reputations and emotional distress PERIOD However because of the documents used and sources interviewed the OCollegian was fully in its right to publish what it did PERIOD



By not reporting this story The Daily OCollegian would have done its readers a disservice PERIOD
