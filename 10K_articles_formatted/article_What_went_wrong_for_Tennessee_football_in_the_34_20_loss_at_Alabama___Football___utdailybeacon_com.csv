Head coach Josh Heupel looks on from the sidelines during the game against Alabama at BryantDenny Stadium PERIOD Saturday Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

TUSCALOOSA Ala PERIOD  Cigar smoke filled BryantDenny Stadium on Saturday night PERIOD Those cigars did not come from orange and white boxes PERIOD

There was no fieldstorming or goalpost tearing down PERIOD It was routine PERIOD Tennessee losing in Tuscaloosa has become routine PERIOD

The Vols havent won on the road against Alabama since  PERIOD That didnt change on Saturday as Tennessee fell  PERIOD

The score certainly doesnt tell the whole story of Saturday night PERIOD The game actually started as good as someone would want for the Vols   SEC PERIOD

Joe Milton III orchestrated an eightplay 75yard drive that got Tennessee on the scoreboard PERIOD It was capped off by a highlight catch from Squirrel White PERIOD

A couple of field goals and another Milton touchdown pass gave Tennessee a  lead going into halftime PERIOD

It was the first time Tennessee had a 13point lead over Alabama on the road since   a dream scenario for the Vols PERIOD

The dream turned to a nightmare very quickly in the third quarter PERIOD

Alabama came out and took just two plays to go  yards and find the end zone PERIOD

End of the day reset gotta keep coming keep playing Tennessee football head coach Josh Heupel said PERIOD And we did at times offensively PERIOD Dont put it in when we get down there with seven eight minutes left and you got a chance to make the game. the one touchdown snowballed PERIOD Tennessee was called for signaling a fair catch by an upman PERIOD

That pinned the Vols at their own 4yard line after the play PERIOD The offense couldnt get anything going and was forced to punt PERIOD

From there it was all downhill PERIOD Nothing different happened during halftime to contribute to the bad second half though PERIOD

The players all echoed the same message

Lets go step on their throats White said of the halftime message PERIOD But obviously we werent able to do it. i believe that we came out with a lot of energy PERIOD The message was just the same PERIOD You got to play all four quarters PERIOD Tonight we didnt get it doneGabe JeudyLally said PERIOD

The Crimson Tide managed to outscore Tennessee  in the second half PERIOD Nothing went right for the Vols PERIOD

The offense stalled penalties increased  to the displeasure of Heupel  and Alabama took all of the momentum PERIOD The loss was reminiscent of Tennessees trip to Florida PERIOD

You got to come out swinging early Milton said PERIOD You got to put a guy to sleep early PERIOD I feel like if you do that I feel like then all the momentum would be on our side for the whole game. alabama ran for  yards in the second half after rushing for just  in the first half PERIOD Milton was blindsided and stripsacked one of Alabamas secondhalf touchdowns PERIOD

Tennessees offense picked up  yards in the first half but finished with  total PERIOD A lot of those yards came near the end of the game in crunch time PERIOD

To make matters worse for the offense the running game was nonexistent for most of the night PERIOD Milton led the way on the ground with  rushing yards on  carries PERIOD The next closest was Dylan Sampson with  yards PERIOD

We just let go of that rope got comfortable linebacker Elijah Herring said PERIOD Felt like we won the game already PERIOD

Its tough out there when things are flying around PERIOD Guys got to snap and reclear PERIOD I mean it seemed like we couldnt do that today. herring denied that is was complacency after halftime but the message from Saturday is clear PERIOD The Vols had the game in hand and couldnt finish the job PERIOD

The trend is becoming a lot more common for Tennessee on the road PERIOD Mistakes snowball into bigger mistakes which snowball into losses PERIOD It happened at Florida PERIOD It happened at Georgia last year PERIOD It happened again on Saturday

A lot of their goals get a lot tougher with the second SEC loss PERIOD A road trip to Kentucky awaits Tennessee who has played poorly on the road PERIOD

I mean the communication is the only thing that in my opinion thats really more difficult Heupel said of the road PERIOD As long as you are settled into your job and doing that when youre out between the white lines PERIOD Today its a good football team PERIOD Were talking about Alabama PERIOD

We didnt reset refocus and make enough plays in the second half PERIOD End result. log In
