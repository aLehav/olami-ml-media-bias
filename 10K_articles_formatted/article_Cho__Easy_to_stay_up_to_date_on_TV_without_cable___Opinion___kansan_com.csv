I used to be an avid fan of cable PERIOD Growing up I couldnt have imagined life without cable television PERIOD But in an age where ondemand services like Netflix and Hulu are increasing in popularity once I went off to college cable wasnt essential to me PERIOD

At the first couple of apartments I lived in cable was provided by the complex free of charge PERIOD But even with the availability I hardly ever watched TV PERIOD If there were ever a big game I would go over to a friends house one who had a much bigger TV or go out and watch it at a bar or restaurant PERIOD There are people who love to catch their favorite shows the moment they premiere or there are people like me who can wait a few days or weeks to watch the episode PERIOD When moving into the apartment I currently live in cable was not provided which made me consider the factors above PERIOD I knew I could cut the cord on cable and still be perfectly fine PERIOD

According to Huffington Post a report releasedby Leichtman Research Group found the  largest payTV providers  shed about  video subscribers in the most recent quarter of  PERIOD The article also reports more than  million homes areopting out of cable and switching to services dedicated to ondemand streaming PERIOD This number will continue to rise especially as cable costs rise with them PERIOD

The price of cable was an unnecessary cost to me and was another bill I did not want to deal with PERIOD The Huffington Post article adds The average cable TV bill not including fees promotions or taxes has increased by a whopping  percent over the past  years. the article continues to state that studies find cable TV bills could reach up to  per month in the next five years PERIOD

Choosing to get rid of cable was not a hard decision but for those who need to watch everything right when it comes out it may be a more difficult option PERIOD I have still managed to stay up to date with all of my favorite shows by using sites that stream episodes online in HD PERIOD If I want to watch a live game I can find websites that stream those online too  though admittedly the quality suffers a bit in this case PERIOD Finding ways to stay up to date with shows prior to their release on ondemand streaming services can take a bit of effort but its an efficient way to save you hundreds of dollars in the long run PERIOD
