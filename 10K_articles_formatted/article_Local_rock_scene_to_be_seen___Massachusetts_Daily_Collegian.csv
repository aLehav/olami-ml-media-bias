Think back to oh    years ago PERIOD Think about what music in Massachusetts meant PERIOD

It meant Xtreme hair ballading about something being more than words PERIOD The House of Pain rapped about jumping PERIOD The New Kids on the Block had the uh right stuff PERIOD And that my friends was more or less it PERIOD

Oh the way things change PERIOD

The Massachusetts rock scene  not crappy hair bands or rap or pop but serious honesttogod ROCK  has exploded in these recent years PERIOD There isnt just one good band or a couple but what seems like an endless well of talent bubbling up from all over the state PERIOD What happened in Seattle in the early 90s  an active club scene legions of young fans and dozens of fantastic bands influential bands pushing for attention  has been duplicated in Massachusetts PERIOD Years from now the zeroes will be remembered as the golden age of the local rock scene PERIOD At this point it isnt a matter of if any bands will reach the national success of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden but which bands will reach that plateau PERIOD

To create a scene as vibrant as the one we are currently enjoying involves several factors PERIOD For one thing the bands need a place to play and the Mass clubs have stepped up PERIOD Bills Bar in Boston Jarrods Place in Attleboro the Fat Cat in Springfield the Palladium in Worcester the Skybox at UMass the LaFayette in Taunton  all these venues and many more have taken to supporting the scene putting on the shows that give the fans exposure PERIOD

Of course the clubs wouldnt book if the bands couldnt draw  and draw they do PERIOD The current renaissance of rock wouldnt be possible if it werent for the amazing rise of the new rockbased youth PERIOD Its mostly kids  that pack these shows PERIOD These are the people who got disgusted with the crap that radio and MTV was shoving down their throats  the kids from your high school who listened to Korn are now fueling the rock movement nonstop PERIOD Can the scene be viewed as a reacting against the altpop crap hiphop and boy bands that have been forcefed to America leading the young to look for sincere rock music and discovering it all around them Perhaps PERIOD Then again if you were to ask the people at the shows youd mostly discover that they just go where the good music is  and thats here PERIOD

The scene has already spawned some national acts which have drawn yet more attention to Bay State rock PERIOD What some have called the Godsmack effect is now in firm hold  one band makes it huge nationwide and the record companies want more of the same PERIOD Theyve found it too PERIOD After Whatever blew up and Godsmack went nuts Staind followed suit PERIOD Reveille toured on the Ozzfest PERIOD Powerman  scored major radio hits and got mucho MTV play PERIOD All of a sudden the record companies realized that theres something special going on in Massachusetts and that people all over the country want to hear it PERIOD The frenzy to find the Next Big Act has begun PERIOD Who will it be
