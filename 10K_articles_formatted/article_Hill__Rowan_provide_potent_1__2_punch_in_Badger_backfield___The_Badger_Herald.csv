2743,2006-09-04,"cLEVELAND  Throughout spring ball summer conditioning and even into fall camp there were many questions surrounding the state of the Wisconsin running game in light of Badger standout Brian Calhoun defecting to the NFL last April PERIOD

Not only have these questions been answered in convincing fashion it appears that the UW offense may not miss a beat without Calhoun in the  season PERIOD The style of running just might look a little different PERIOD

During Wisconsins  defeat of Bowling Green on Saturday the Falcon defense was consistently hammered by a pair of bowlingballsized backs P.J PERIOD Hill and Dywon Rowan PERIOD Hill plunged his way to  yards on  carries and a touchdown whereas Rowan chipped in with  yards and UWs first touchdown of the game PERIOD

At 5foot11 and  pounds Hill made a resounding statement in the first start of his career literally hauling Bowling Green defenders down the field on many occasions PERIOD As a result Hill averaged nearly six yards a carry on the evening PERIOD

 said Hill who only lost three yards from scrimmage PERIOD 

 quarterback John Stocco added PERIOD 

With new coach Bret Bielema at the helm most of Hills carries seemed to come in bunches as he regularly ran the ball on two or three consecutive offensive plays during the night PERIOD

 Hill said PERIOD

Rowan saw most of his action in the first half but the 5foot9 241pound fifthyear senior helped the Badgers gain an early advantage PERIOD After Bowling Green eased down the field for a  lead on the first drive Wisconsin answered with a 10play 66yard drive capped by Rowans 7yard dash to the left side of the end zone PERIOD

 Rowan said PERIOD 

Hill who didnt find the end zone until  left in the fourth quarter said he knows he can be more than a sufficient successor to Calhoun  a quicker and flashier runner PERIOD

 Hill said PERIOD 

That other style came from true freshman Lance Smith who on the first play of his career broke free for a 14yard carry up the middle PERIOD Two plays later Stocco hit full back Bill Rentmeester for a 4yard touchdown pushing the UW lead to  PERIOD

Smith also earned some lategame work and turned in an eightcarry 42yard performance for the Badgers PERIOD

On the other side of the ball Wisconsins defense struggled to contain Falcon quarterback Freddie Barnes PERIOD In the redshirt freshmans first start Barnes all but destroyed the UW run defense dashing for  yards and two scores PERIOD

But that didnt stop Wisconsin from matching the Falcons running game equaling Bowling Greens mark of . yards per carry as a team PERIOD In the end Barnes two touchdowns were not enough as the Badgers were able to utilize the steady run power from Hill Rowan and Smith to craft three touchdown drives of at least  yards PERIOD

If the first game of Wisconsins season serves as any indication Bielema will not hesitate to employ two three or even four backs PERIOD Bielema acknowledged that Jamil Walker will be incorporated into the mix of running backs throughout the remainder of the year PERIOD

 Bielema said PERIOD
