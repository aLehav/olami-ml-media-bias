Stony Brook professor Dr PERIOD Eckard Wimmer and assistant research professor Dr PERIOD Jeronimo Cello have recently collaborated with Stony Brook University and Janssen Pharmaceuticals to develop an inactive polio vaccine based on highly attenuated polio viral seed strains PERIOD

According to the universitys press release These strains when inactivated have the potential to be as effective and as safe as the current activated poliovirus vaccine IPV. wimmer who has been at Stony Brook for nearly forty years is best known for his work on the poliovirus PERIOD

Last May he was inducted into the National Academy of Science PERIOD



Sean Boykevisch who facilitated the agreement between Janssen and the university lauded Wimmers accomplishments and contributions to the field of virology which include the elucidation of the chemical structure of the poliovirus genome and the first in vitro synthesis of polio or any organism for that matter. in  Dr PERIOD Wimmer and Dr PERIOD Cello developed a novel poliovirus that was stably neuroattenuated and they identified its first application as a possible therapy for the treatment of neuroblastoma Boykevisch said PERIOD

They realized that the engineered virus can have other applications as well such as in the manufacturing of inactivated polio vaccine IPV and proceeded to study this application with funding from the World Health Organization Boykevisch said PERIOD

According to Boykevisch higher reliance on IPV necessitates new safer seed viruses for its manufacture. wimmer and his colleagues are working with Janssen to evaluate the seed viruses that they developed to determine if they are suitable for use in manufacturing IPV PERIOD

If so Janssen will use the seed strains to manufacture a new inactive polio vaccine PERIOD

Current polio vaccines are made from a wildtype poliovirus which is more dangerous and could lead to further health issues PERIOD

There are two types of vaccine one is called oral vaccine that you used to receive in the States which was made of a live attenuated virus PERIOD Now its not given here but it is in the rest of the world Cello explained PERIOD

Eventually that vaccine could mutate and give you side effects and give you paralysis. so now the World Health Organization doesnt want to use that vaccine anymore and they want to go to the inactive polio vaccine Cello said PERIOD

Cello said he Wimmer the university and Janssen Pharmaceuticals are each making a contribution towards this project to develop the vaccine PERIOD

We use the laboratories here but more than that the university is dealing with all the legal aspects of our work and in this case they are working with the company in Holland PERIOD At the same time the university helps protect our rights as inventors Cello said PERIOD

We dont have the ability to commercialize all these products and Janssen have a system where we can produce a huge amount of the vaccine he continued PERIOD

While we are developing the seed strain they are making it safer and cheaper Cello said PERIOD

The most worthwhile part of the process Cello said is the chance to help people avoid contracting the disease PERIOD

I think its nice I think everyone wants their research to be used in a way that will help he continued PERIOD

In this case eradicate a disease or treat a disease and youre helping the society PERIOD To see our research is put in action in this way and see this result its rewarding. hanaa is a senior journalism and Spanish Language and Literature major PERIOD After coming to Stony Brook Hanaa decided she wanted to explore print and online media after previously working in radio PERIOD She joined The Statesman in the fall of her freshman year and became an assistant editor that spring PERIOD She hopes to use her language and multimedia skills to travel and someday work for a Spanishlanguage publication in either Spain or South America PERIOD Contact Hanaa at emailprotected PERIOD
