Who are you going to call Ghostbusters

Although its a common pop culture reference from the beloved 1980s movie Ghostbusters you have to admit that ghosts in a comedy arent that scary PERIOD But take a drama like The Eclipse and mix in a wellcalculated script seamless acting breathless cinematography and ghosts and you have yourself a crafty film that will give you a whole new perspective on ghosts PERIOD

In this chilling film Michael Farr Ciarn Hinds Munich is haunted by the loss of his wife and his recent encounters with ghosts PERIOD As a chauffer at the Cobh Literary Festival in Ireland he provides his services to authors Lena Morelle Iben Hjejle Live fra Bremen and Nicolas Holden Aidan Quinn TVs Law  Order Special Victims Unit PERIOD

Lenas reading from a passage of her book The Eclipse speaks to Michael on a personal level PERIOD Her words reverberate throughout the room as she confesses when you see a ghost your brain splits in two PERIOD One side of you is rejecting what you see and the other side is screaming at you but this is real. lena and Michael reveal stories of their ghostly encounters and form a profound connection PERIOD Lena allows Michael to come to terms with his reality PERIOD While Michael finds solace in her words Nicolas arrogant and egotistical feels threatened by Michaels connection with Lena PERIOD

Based on Billy Roches Tales from Rainwater Pond Irish playwright and director Conor McPherson aims to show how one characters piece of literary work has the power to shed light on a mans griefridden struggle PERIOD While McPhersons script is clever with an intuitive writing style the most compelling effect he brings to the film is the unanimous visual language which speaks volumes as its interpretation relates to humanity as a whole PERIOD The language is well read by viewers due to the honest content within the romance scenes PERIOD McPherson illustrates how a fervent bond requires few words as this unspoken language lucidly intertwines between the romantic scenes and the supernatural occurrences PERIOD These two genres are spread throughout the film switching from romance to thriller in one cohesive production PERIOD

With heavenly cinematography the films creepy factor is intensified by Irelands peaceful scenery PERIOD The white soft clouds that overhang Irelands soothing shoreline contradict the spinetingling ghostly encounters PERIOD The unlikely appearance of a ghost in the serene setting offers the film a heightened sense of reality and is actually quite perfect PERIOD This is enhanced by the colorful and patient camera work especially the tracking shots that personify the viewer PERIOD Thanks to this small trick viewers will feel as if they are taking on the role of a ghost in the film PERIOD

McPhersons experience as a playwright carries over into this film as he gives the characters playlike attributes PERIOD Initially Michael appears as an average character in a ghost movie but it is his captivating emotional depth that adds authenticity to his role and allows viewers to relate to him on a deeper level PERIOD And it doesnt hurt to know that Hinds won the Best Actor award at last years Tribeca Film Festival for his work in The Eclipse. while Hinds takes on the character of Michael effortlessly throughout the film he is most convincing in the final scenes in a performance that is sure to touch viewers PERIOD

While he steals the show Hjejle flourishes in her role as well PERIOD Hjejle complements Hinds in his role as she is perceptive incorporating subtle mannerisms into her character PERIOD

While the acting is convincing the haunting choral music sets the mood of the movie throughout the production PERIOD The somber melody in the opening scene foreshadows the gravity of the film and embodies a sinister essence PERIOD The pianos classical sound and abrupt absence enhance the film and intensify the sounds of silence adding to the suspense factor PERIOD

McPherson manages to wrap a love story and a ghost story into one movie while also touching and frightening viewers PERIOD A quality piece of work The Eclipse may have viewers calling the Ghostbusters just as a precaution because of the films realistic quality PERIOD

  stars out of  PERIOD
