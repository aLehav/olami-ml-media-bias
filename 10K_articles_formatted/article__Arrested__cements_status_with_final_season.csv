The list of TV shows on which Charlize Theron is willing to play a fiveepisode arc has got to be pretty short PERIOD Luckily she chose to play a mentally retarded English woman on the third and final season of Arrested Development instead of say an impromptu Vinny Chase hookup PERIOD

And while a stint on a TV comedy apparently watched by nobody may not have the careerdefining power of her Oscar it does say a lot about the show and those who love it PERIOD Its this small devoted fan base consisting of Hollywood Alisters and college undergrads that should pick up the truncated third season DVD of televisions greatest comedy sorry Seinfeld PERIOD

The 12episode set is primarily focused on two extended plotlines PERIOD The first is Michael Bluths Jason Bateman Dodgeball unfortunate relationship with Rita Charlize Theron Monster a special young woman from southern Californias Wee Britain essentially the British equivalent of Chinatown PERIOD  The second set of episodes centers on the resolution of George Sr.s Jeffrey Tambor Twenty Good Years legal problems and effectively ties up the series PERIOD

Season three may not be on par with the second but its uncommonly funny  although probably a little too selfreferential for its own good PERIOD Once the writing staff knew their days on Fox were numbered they loaded the show with tiebacks and gags from past seasons that left casual viewers not knowing what they missed PERIOD

For a show in its final season with such a devoted fan base the features are a disappointment to say the least PERIOD Three episodes have audio commentaries from the full cast sans Jeffrey Tambor and although its nice to hear the actors interact outside of their fictional world its a mess that resembles a cast reunion more than a show commentary PERIOD At one point creator Mitch Hurwitz calls Tambor on his cellphone to get an explanation for his absence and chaos ensues PERIOD Also included is a short feature documenting the last day on set a blooper reel and deleted scenes PERIOD

Although the special features cant stand up to the likes of Freaks and Geeks and other cult comedies the episodes alone validate this set and firmly place it in the pantheon of comic television PERIOD
