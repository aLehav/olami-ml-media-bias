8601,1970-01-01,"before every sporting event in the United States the national anthem The StarSpangled Banner is played to celebrate the countrys freedom and those who protect it PERIOD N.C PERIOD State does not excluded this tradition PERIOD Before the basketballs are tipped off at PNC Arena and Reynolds Coliseum before the footballs are kicked off at CarterFinley Stadium and before the first baseballs are thrown at Doak Field the iconic tune is either played over the public address system or by the Power Sound of the South PERIOD

The students as well as all other fans and spectators stand up and face either the flag if it is in sight or the general direction from where the sound is coming PERIOD What strikes a sour chord in my game day experience is what the student body does when the anthem draws to a close PERIOD In place of the word brave the students of State shout out the schools athletic nickname Wolfpack. as a student I have much pride in the university and the student athletes that compete but participating in this has been uncomfortable for me for a number of reasons PERIOD The central reason spawns from why I am a freshman in communication rather than a sophomore majoring in mathematics PERIOD

After graduating high school in June  I joined the North Carolina Army National Guard in hopes of getting financial aid to come to this institution PERIOD In doing this I had to cancel my enrollment for that August PERIOD In the following October I left home and travelled to Fort Sill Oklahoma to spend two months as a member of fourth platoon in Charlie Battery First Battalion and thirty-first Field Artillery within the  Basic Combat Training Brigade PERIOD

During that time I spent as a Private First Class I worked with soldiers who are now spread out across the globe from South Korea to Afghanistan even some who are stationed down the highway at Fort Bragg PERIOD

Even though I did not have the chance to finish my training to say that the starspangled banner waves over the land of the free and the home of the Wolfpack would be a disservice to my colleagues and those who served and continue to serve the country PERIOD

When Francis Scott Key the original writer of the poem was held captive during the  Battle of Baltimore he saw the nations flag flying over Fort McHenry following a bombardment by the British Royal Navy PERIOD He did not write his composition to celebrate the protection of a college that wouldnt be formed until over  years later PERIOD

Key was inspired because despite the threat of Great Britain the young nation of America still fought and defeated one of the greatest military forces in the world even after having lost in the Revolutionary War PERIOD

In  President Herbert Hoover did not sign the congressional resolution to make this song the official anthem because of a university that was known as the Wolfpack for only nine years at that point PERIOD

Hoover signed it because the anthem spoke of how no matter who threatens the nation or what danger any enemy presents the flag will always wave proudly over the land of the free and the home of the brave PERIOD









is not excluded

I think youre missing the point PERIOD In my opinion its kids being kids and thousands of Americans have fought and died for the student body to have that right including many MANY North Carolinians and NCSU Alumni PERIOD When they shout  at the end I believe that its the student body paying tribute to those members of the pack who have served are serving and will continue to serve as long as theres a United States of America PERIOD As North Carolina residents and NCSU students we the home of the  Wolfpack are also the home of the brave.Ted SpencerVice President NCSU Student Veterans AssociationU.S PERIOD Navy

Thank you for you service PERIOD

WOLFPACK beam

I would agree more if the national anthem wasnt played at every event in the country regardless PERIOD  Not too long ago the anthem was reserved for major events such as a national championship or the Super Bowl PERIOD These days it is played at the start of a junior high tennis match PERIOD  I truly believe overuse has desensitized us to the relevance of the words PERIOD If the song itself were more revered by our citizens as a whole to wit reserved for special occasions Im certain our students would reciprocate PERIOD
