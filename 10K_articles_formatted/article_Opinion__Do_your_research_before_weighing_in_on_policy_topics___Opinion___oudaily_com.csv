Time is a precious and scarce thing for many people PERIOD So for those who try to have informed opinions on public policy short and sweet news makes sense PERIOD Perhaps this is why Trumps simple language and daily updates on Twitter are so widely referenced and why Facebook and Reddit are now major news sources but there is as always a catch PERIOD It may sound obvious to say that you cannot learn all the details of a political situation from Trump tweets or even a whole news article but how much do you have to learn to really be informed Thoughts worth having may actually be terrifyingly long and nitpicky PERIOD

First of all there is the trouble of deciding if what you read even makes sense by itself PERIOD People tend to accept whatever is said by people or organizations they trust PERIOD If you are thinking  then you are especially at risk PERIOD Sometimes we trust the wrong people to be honest PERIOD Sometimes honest people get lazy and fail to do their research or think through their short arguments PERIOD And sometimes smart people get emotionally invested in a topic and stop making arguments at all settling instead for something closer to verbal assassination or digital tears PERIOD Nobody makes great points all the time PERIOD Even major news outlets have gotten in trouble for awardwinning journalists making up articles and for doing a bad job publicizing retractions and corrections just google Jayson Blair and Janet Cooke PERIOD

The second trouble with a short thought is that it does not give enough room for a good discussion of data PERIOD As a tutor at OU for several statistics courses I can say with confidence that taking an introductory statistics course does not make one aware of the intricacies of data PERIOD Of course there are also the many millions of people who never even take a statistics course but often share statistics proving their positions PERIOD If you really look into the data it turns out that there are all kinds of problems skewing the proof like unresponsive samples researcher bias poorly conducted studies and data that just cannot be found no matter how hard researchers try PERIOD Even if the best researcher is working with the best data many people do not appreciate that statistics is at its core about probability PERIOD When results are significant it means the researchers are comfortable claiming that their sample represents everybody because they are probably right PERIOD Even a nonexistent perfect piece of data that is perfectly analyzed does not definitively prove an argument PERIOD It supports it PERIOD

Sometimes in an effort to avoid the second trouble people encounter a third trouble PERIOD When you are not knowledgeable about statistics reliance on experts is a good way to compensate but there are almost always experts on every side of an issue PERIOD Admittedly some experts are more credible than others the Heritage Foundation may be a better conservative source than the National Policy Institute PERIOD But many times experts just have different basic assumptions about the world that determine which research they believe is credible PERIOD There are great researchers at both the Urban Institute and at the Heritage Foundation but good luck finding issues on which they agree PERIOD It can be extremely timeconsuming to figure out which experts are worthwhile and when they disagree about facts versus assumptions PERIOD

The truth about any public policy is out there to be discovered but it takes a painfully long time to find and may necessarily assume an untestable view of the world PERIOD Words have power and since almost none of us have the time or skill to find the truth about every issue maybe we could do everyone a favor by hesitating to weigh in on topics we have not thoroughly researched PERIOD Perhaps this would help make politics less toxic and  less important PERIOD
