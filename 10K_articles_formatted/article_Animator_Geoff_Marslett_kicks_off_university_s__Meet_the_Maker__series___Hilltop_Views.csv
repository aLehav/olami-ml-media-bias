Students gather to attend Geoff Marslett seminar covering the trials and tribulations of animation and the film industry PERIOD

Creative Geoff Marslett visited St PERIOD Edwards University on Sept PERIOD  to talk with students about independent filmmaking as part of a Meet the Maker series hosted by the university PERIOD

Showing up with gravitydefying hair and a  Honda Odyssey with  miles on it Marsletts opening remarks to students seemed quite bleak PERIOD

A horrible business he said about filmmaking PERIOD Its really hard it will beat you down. appearing at various film and animation festivals like Sundance BFI London and SXSW he has been a director writer producer animator and actor PERIOD Some of his works shown include Loves Her Gun and The Day Before and Yakona. along with maintaining his presence in the film industry Marslett has also educated college students at the University of Texas at Austin Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Colorado at Boulder about film and animation PERIOD

Sometimes when I am teaching I ask myself what Geoff would do and use that for inspiration Jeanne Stern Marsletts former teaching assistant and current animation professor at St PERIOD Edwards said PERIOD

Marslett studied math and philosophy in college and ended up animating his first short titled Monkey VS Robot in the 90s PERIOD This animation later gained traction showing at Spike and Mikes Classic Festival of Animation and on PBS PERIOD



Youll get a lot of strikeouts Marslett told students PERIOD You get better at this as you go. in  Marslett went on to animate MARS a romantic comedy following astronauts and robots on the way to Mars PERIOD He created unique programming to make this animation style happen PERIOD

Animation is harder to do so less people do it Marslett said PERIOD

His next animation Phantom  starring Tom Skerrit appeared at the  Sundance Film Festival PERIOD With this feature Marslett emphasized casting animators the way you would cast actors PERIOD

Rising tides will raise all ships together Marslett said when talking about the collaboration between animators PERIOD

This mixing of animation styles carries over into Marsletts Quantum Cowboys which was featured on Sept PERIOD  as part of Fantastic Fest PERIOD

According to IMDb this rotoscoped timetravel western follows a trio across 1870s southwestern Arizona while portraying complex quantum time theory and philosophical musings about art as the way we understand our history and memories. geoffs greatest strengths are that he believes in his work and never gives up Stern said PERIOD

After working in the film industry for  years Marslett has a healthy dose of skepticism regarding what it means to be successful but also has a hopeful set of eyes trained on the future PERIOD

I genuinely believe some of you students will beat the system and make some things that we will have never seen before Marslett said as his last piece of advice to St PERIOD Edwards students PERIOD
