Editors note Sara Johnson fifth year senior studying

privatecommercial recreation submitted this guest commentary earlier this

month PERIOD The sentiments expressed might be appropriate now as finals are

approaching. may seem to be the new pickup line

heard around campus these days PERIOD The beautiful Autumn leaves are leaving

the football season is late in the fourth quarter and freshmen are aging

gracefully PERIOD Where does all of our precious time go What exactly is

time

This semester is especially crucial for all of those fifth year seniors who

will have to make the painful transition into the career world in a couple

of weeks PERIOD I am one of these frightened souls who is now realizing that its

time to slow down PERIOD We need to stop take a deep breath look around and

actually try to take as much in as possible PERIOD I mean really look around and

realize that we will no longer be allowed to play and be our adolescent

selves anymore PERIOD Maybe if everyone as a student body would collectively

take a deep breath together say Friday at  p.m. we could all manage to

slow Father Time down for awhile PERIOD

Time defines and sets the parameters of our daily activities lives

personalities and ambitions PERIOD  is an excuse many of

us use when thinking of what could have been or why we did not produce PERIOD

Time periods in our life  grade school high school college  all trigger

certain memories and have allowed us to develop into ourselves PERIOD Time is

life and life is full of time PERIOD So there should be no excuses right James

Taylor is one of the better role models for relishing lifes opportunities

it throws at us PERIOD Taylor sings about his knowledge and lets us know  Maybe that sounds too

easy but maybe thats why people have made him a success PERIOD

Graduate school backpacking through Europe working out west  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD these

are a few of the options we have to delay this reality we need to face PERIOD

This transition time sounds much more inviting especially to those needing

to develop their level of maturation before they step into that business

suit PERIOD Time is a wonderful factor especially when we have an abundance of

it PERIOD  the freshmen cry PERIOD Wah wah PERIOD Enjoy your

time to grow up and dont forget to do so PERIOD This is an important lesson to

learn especially to those who put it off for so long PERIOD Time is of the

essence right now in our young lives PERIOD Remember Ferris Buellers famous

philosophy on life
