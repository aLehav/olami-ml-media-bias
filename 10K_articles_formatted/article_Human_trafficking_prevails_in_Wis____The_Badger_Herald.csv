2840,2012-03-13,"human trafficking a modernday form of slavery and a growing criminal activity both internationally and also here within Wisconsin goes largely unnoticed by most citizens PERIOD

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime defines human trafficking as the act of recruiting transporting harboring or receiving a person through use of force coercion or deception with the purpose of sexual exploitation commercial sex acts or labor exploitation PERIOD

Slave Free Madison a community action group cites human trafficking as the secondlargest criminal activity in the world with  billion in profits each year second only to drug trafficking PERIOD The Bureau of Justice Statistics lists the average cost of purchasing a person at just  PERIOD

Another such group 5Stones which originated in Appleton has been working to not only inform individuals of the crime but also to provide an emergency shelter for victims of sexual trafficking the most prominent form of human trafficking in the state PERIOD

A firsthand account of sex trafficking was aired at a 5Stones event where the organizations volunteers put together a 12minute video interview with a woman who had been a victim for almost  years PERIOD

The woman who went by the name Lisa explained she had been in college and gotten into what she described as a normal relationship that gradually became a form of sexual trafficking as her boyfriend brainwashed her into it PERIOD

I think its a situation young women can get trapped in Lisa said PERIOD It can happen anywhere in a lot of different ways. her boyfriend had started using her initially by asking her to upload sexual pictures to the Internet and trying things she was not comfortable with in bed eventually using her to make money through exploitation PERIOD

For a long time I was lost really lost Lisa said PERIOD It was a living hell. in an interview with The Badger Herald Melissa Hollendyke the coordinator of a recent 5Stones event explained the misconceptions about and problems of human trafficking PERIOD

Trafficking does not necessarily have to mean moving over state lines or international boundaries Hollendyke said PERIOD It can happen in any number of ways though it tends to occur among those who are in a vulnerable position. these examples can range from a father forcing his child to commit commercial sex acts for money in order to help pay the familys rent to an individual being kidnapped at a bus stop drugged and forcibly held in a brothel overseas Hollendyke said PERIOD

Since its such a broad misunderstood phenomenon it is assumed to be largely underreported Hollendyke said PERIOD

Another problem 5Stones recognizes is that a victim of sex trafficking can be arrested for prostitution and never recognized as a victim of trafficking plaguing their record and life in such a way that makes it hard for these individuals to move on in life Hollendyke said PERIOD

Victims of trafficking can have difficulty getting away from their captors because victims may fear for their lives be held against their will by violence and drugs or believe that their trafficker has their best interests in mind Hollendyke said PERIOD

Although sex trafficking is considered the most prominent form of human trafficking JoAnn GruberHagen a spokesperson for Slave Free Madison believes labor trafficking also exists in Wisconsin but is even harder to recognize PERIOD

What I think most of us arent very good at is identifying that when we eat at a nice restaurant we dont know how these people cleaning our tables or doing our dishes are involved in the business or if they are being paid GruberHagen said PERIOD In those situations they look like they are just doing their job. gruberHagen also thinks agriculture is a big area where people tend to be exploited which is only an estimate because of the fact that roughly  percent of the nationwide victims of labor trafficking are foreignborn and many are undocumented PERIOD

This is in sharp contrast to sex trafficking with the vast majority of nationwide sex trafficking victims being U.S PERIOD citizens not people from another country as many suspect GruberHagen said PERIOD

In general help geared specifically for victims of sex trafficking is hard to come by as the U.S PERIOD currently only has five shelters for victims totaling just  beds Hollendyke said PERIOD

In a recent analysis of each states laws Shared Hope International a global effort against sexual trafficking rated Wisconsin with a D in addressing the overall problem PERIOD

Shared Hope Internationals Protected Innocence Initiative identified Wisconsins lack of tools to conduct investigations and identify sex trafficking cases as the major sources of failure leaving room for improvement with motivation from groups within the state according to their website PERIOD

With nearly  raised through 5Stones Awareness Through the Arts event the organization plans to split the funds between establishing Wisconsins first shelter for these victims as well as developing a Wisconsinbased documentary on the issue Hollendyke said PERIOD

Slave Free Madison hopes to continue alerting people of the crimes that are happening and also to work to pass legislation that will give law enforcement and other groups better ability to deal with the issue GruberHagen said PERIOD
