By  Sam Weber Staff Writer September  

Gun violence is one of the most divisive issues in American culture today but the UPTVbased nonpartisan political television show The Bully PulPitt set out to investigate that issue through discussion on Wednesday night PERIOD

The Bully PulPitts Lets Talk  Gun Violence discussion in the William Pitt Union Lower Lounge focused on educating students on the reasons behind violence in different settings organized as domestic police suicide mass shooting and homicide PERIOD

We dont expect to find the solution to gun violence in one night the events Facebook description said PERIOD What we do hope is to be able to begin discussing what people have been telling us to talk about for so long. executive producer Annabelle Hanflig and the staff of The Bully PulPitt divided the group of nearly  students into five groups each with their own starting point for the discussion PERIOD The groups once seated together listened to some words of advice for the night from Hanflig PERIOD

This discussion isnt about being afraid of this topic Hanflig said PERIOD Were here to be able to be wrong while learning truth. one group consisted of senior nursing major Zoe Klingenberg senior economics and math major Nick Pagano junior finance major Greg Carlson and senior industrial engineering major Jahari Mercer PERIOD

That group of students were from drastically different backgrounds but all having prior exposure to firearms PERIOD Through the event the group was able to engage in a conversation about what can help in reaching solutions to gun violence PERIOD

The discussion began with a statement from moderator Vikaas Arunkumar meant to prompt conversation PERIOD

Studies have shown that when people address the community instead of the government better results come through Arunkumar said PERIOD Some areas like Chicago have brought in exgang leaders to try and rehabilitate the community. in the conversation on gun homicide the first to offer an idea about this situation was senior political science major Katie Vossler with a statement about the lack of understanding that people have about gun control PERIOD

Theres huge pressure for a topdown reform by the government taking away guns as a goto idea while talking and understanding is more helpful Vossler said PERIOD People think it would be easier to have a national movement against guns when community outreach is so much more usable and practical. as the session on homicide came to a close the group moved to the topic of mass shootings and their impact in American society PERIOD After initially looking over a fact sheet distributed by the presenters SGB executive vice president Jahari Mercer said he was shocked at how minor the impact of recent mass shootings had been in reference to total annual death by gun violence PERIOD

I dont understand the need to be able to buy what many times began its use as a military weapon Mercer said PERIOD The fact that the use of these types of weapons is possible but barely makes a dent in annual deaths is horrifying. the next discussion focused on gun violence and domestic abuse the discussion centering on the social sexual and racial issues in which problems arise and result in violence PERIOD

Klingenberg said its often a problem in these situations that healthcare professionals dont seriously screen for domestic violence in their patients PERIOD

Ive seen in the health care system that even when someone comes in and is asked if they are abused they arent recognized for it and that the medical field needs to take this more seriously she said PERIOD

The next discussion centered on policebased violence PERIOD The moderator for this discussion political science major and columnist for The Pitt News Jeremy Wang cited from personal experience interning with the police that police departments are often spread thin and the regulations behind use of deadly force will vary in different locations PERIOD

Senior economics and math major Nick Pagano said he has seen how proper integration with officers can limit the fear of them and therefore better understand the regulation behind use of force PERIOD

The job of the police is to make people feel safer than normal Pagano said PERIOD Solely seeing them as an antagonist in situations even when we are at fault only promotes the fearmongering in reactionary actions to the police. the final discussion before wrapping up the night was that of suicide and gun use PERIOD The most prevalent suicide rates by gun use were in white males over the age of  a statistic that caused a decrease in the average life expectancy of the average American male for the first time in  years PERIOD

Junior Finance major Greg Carlson referenced how he had heard before that individuals who need help do not always seek it out PERIOD

In places like here for instance people have all the possibilities to get help when they need it Carlson said PERIOD Its a matter of people dont always know where to go or they dont want to feel like they are different than everyone else. correction A previous version of this story incorrectly cited Hanflig as the speaker of the quote which is the description of the event on Facebook PERIOD This story also previously reported Klingenbergs major and that she said domestic violence victims werent taken seriously  Klingenberg was referring to her perception that healthcare professionals dont adequately screen for domestic violence in their patients PERIOD This story has been updated PERIOD
