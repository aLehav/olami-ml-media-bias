Osborne

Nebraskas  football recruiting class blendsold names with the new places and fills big holes with newfaces.The younger brothers of three  Cornhuskers the sonof a former Husker and a pair of recruits from untappedstates separate the group signed Wednesday from those ofpast years.On national letterofintent signing day Coach TomOsborne termed the  new Huskers  and said NU successfully filled the positionstargeted most in its recruiting effort.Osborne said But that doesnt bother me PERIOD The last three or fouryears weve had reasonably good success and I dont thinkweve had a class that was ranked real high.Everyone did what they said they were going to doYou are always a little concerned thatsomebody will change their mind and leave you high and dry.But that didnt happen.A guy out of Gregory S.D. isnt going to have asmany people recruit him as somebody out of Fort LauderdaleWeve got a huge logistics problemTo tryto filter all the information is very difficult PERIOD Justidentifying the players is the first thing and then wevegot to get them here.Thats almost like having another five to eightscholarship playersWe unabashedly do that.Its been one way that weve been able to survive againstthe Florida schools.If we didnt have the walkons come hereIthink it wouldnt be long before we became a secondrateprogram PERIOD Theyre very very important to us. back to Sports page
