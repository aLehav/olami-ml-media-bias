When Nebraska steps on the floor Saturday to play Baylor they wont be playing for an atlarge spot in the NCAA tournament PERIOD

The Cornhuskers are currently  and  in conference play and only one Big  Conference team has ever made the NCAA tournament with an  record PERIOD

Most have accepted that NUs only chance at the  is a Big  tournament championship or maybe a runnerup finish PERIOD

But thats a tall task for any Big  team that isnt a topfour seed in the tournament PERIOD Those top four teams enjoy a day of relaxation as the bottom eight beat each other up on the court hoping to advance to the next round PERIOD

So an NCAA tournament bid isnt likely for NU but theres still reason for positive thinking going into the season finale in Waco Texas PERIOD

If the Huskers win theyll finish with a . league record for the first time in a decade PERIOD

NUs last . or better season was in  when Danny Nee led the Huskers to a  record and a fifthplace finish in the league PERIOD

Nebraska has the NIT tournament in its sights and could possibly host a firstround game at the Bob Devaney Sports Center PERIOD

Despite losing three of its last four games Nebraska seems to be getting better offensively PERIOD

The Huskers have had backtoback games with more than  points although it took them awhile to get started against Iowa State on Wednesday PERIOD

 said NU point guard Cookie Miller who scored  points against the Cyclones PERIOD 

Nebraska has consistently been a top defensive team but have struggled scoring points all season PERIOD

NU coach Doc Sadler said hes pleased with how his team has picked it up offensively but said points are easy to come by if players make shots PERIOD Its the stingy NU defense that still makes him proud PERIOD

 Sadler said PERIOD  Baylor entered the season with a lot of hype and were expected to finish in the upper half of the conference but have disappointed with a  league record PERIOD The Bears sit in ninthplace just behind the eighthplace Huskers PERIOD

Since the eight and nine seeds play in the first round of the conference tournament Saturdays game likely will be a preview of Wednesday PERIOD

Sadler said even though Baylor isnt living up to preseason hype its still going to be a tough game PERIOD

 Sadler said PERIOD
