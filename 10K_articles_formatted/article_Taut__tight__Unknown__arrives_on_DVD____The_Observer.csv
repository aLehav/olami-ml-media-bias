Sean Sweany  Sunday February  

Fear of the uncertain is one of the most alarming and terrifying feelings PERIOD Not knowing where one is how one got there or  worst of all  who one is can instill a terror so profound that one resorts to desperate measures to find the answers to these simple questions PERIOD

This is the dilemma facing five men who awake to find themselves injured and locked inside a warehouse in the movie Unknown. confused as to who they are and why they are injured the men learn from a discarded newspaper they are all connected with a kidnapping plot  and that two were kidnapped while the other three were kidnappers PERIOD

A phone call alerts them that the ringleader of the kidnapping will return to the warehouse in several hours to sort out the situation PERIOD What follows is a race against time for the men to piece together their collective memories and escape the warehouse before the other kidnappers arrive PERIOD

The greatest strength of Unknown is its script PERIOD Penned by Notre Dame grad Matthew Waynee the smart writing drops hints and creates mystery at just the right times PERIOD Cerebral explorations of good and evil take place at the same time as character development and even brief flashes of humor demonstrating Waynees skill in his first screenplay PERIOD

The narrative is quickpaced and complex using flashbacks to gradually reveal the truth to the audience slightly before the characters themselves realize it PERIOD One man Jim Caviezel The Passion of the Christ seems most integral to the plot and quickly becomes the storys protagonist PERIOD

Caviezels fellow actors include Greg Kinnear Little Miss Sunshine Barry Pepper Saving Private Ryan Joe Pantoliano Memento and Jeremy Sisto Six Feet Under all of whose story arcs weave in and out of each other as their characters gain and lose each others trust PERIOD

At its heart Unknown is a psychological thriller about the interaction of fear and trust and all five men convey this perfectly in their acting PERIOD Occasionally the narrative eases the tension by leaving the warehouse to show us the head kidnapper Peter Stormare Prison Break and the wife of one of the kidnapped men Bridget Moynahan I Robot two deep characters that add much to the film PERIOD

The excellent script and acting overcome what is mediocre directing and camera work especially since the unchanging setting provided director Simon Brand a realm of creative possibilities PERIOD The simple and repetitive cinematography becomes evident towards the end of the film which is also when the whole ship starts to sink PERIOD

In any film of this genre like Reservoir Dogs one expects plot twists and they begin in earnest in the last  minutes of Unknown. as the plot twists begin to pile up like the dead bodies in the film however the plausibility becomes questionable PERIOD

Ultimately the good traits of the first thrilling hour of the movie become negated by unrealistic events and connections viewers are asked to believe in the last few minutes PERIOD This is not to say that the movie is not worthwhile  the acting is superb and the first five minutes alone should be enough to hook anyone PERIOD However it is hard to imagine what Unknown could have been had its ending kept pace with the rest of the movie PERIOD
