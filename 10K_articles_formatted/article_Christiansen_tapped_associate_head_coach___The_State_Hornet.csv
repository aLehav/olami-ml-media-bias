Dustin NoslerSeptember  

Reggie Christiansen the Hornets hitting coach during the  season was promoted to associate head coach for the  season by head coach John Smith on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

Christiansen came to Sacramento State last year from South Dakota State University where he served as head coach of the baseball team for four years PERIOD

Christiansen said many of his duties will remain the same despite the promotion PERIOD

Its a very nice gesture from Dr PERIOD Terry Wanless and head coach John Smith Christiansen said PERIOD Its more of a show of appreciation for what Ive done here in the short time Ive been here more than anything. according to a Hornets Sports release the team hit . and had  home runs in   both good for fourthbest in school history PERIOD Christiansen also helped former Hornet outfielder Tim Wheeler become the highestdrafted baseball player in school history PERIOD Wheeler was selected thirty-second overall by the Colorado Rockies in June PERIOD

Christiansen said his duties as associate head coach are not dissimilar from the duties he had as the hitting coach PERIOD

I do the majority of the recruiting he said PERIOD On the field I coach the hitters and this year Ill coach the infielders PERIOD I coach third base and on game days I call the pitches PERIOD I guess Im much more involved than most assistant coaches PERIOD

Head coach John Smith has really given me a lot of latitude and freedom to do a lot of things on the field and off the field. assistant coach Jim Barr a 12year Major League Baseball veteran said he supports the move PERIOD

I think its a good deal Barr said PERIOD

Barr feels Christiansens organizational skills are going to be an asset to the team PERIOD

He is very well organized in the things he wants to do he said PERIOD He demands the players to be detailoriented which you always want. smith said he chose Christiansen for a number of reasons but one reason is his previous head coaching experience PERIOD

Smith said he had tried to hire Christiansen in the past before he finally accepted an offer to join the Hornets coaching staff last year PERIOD

I had met him prior at the University of Kansas baseball camp Smith said PERIOD I really enjoyed our conversations and I knew he was a true baseball guy he cared about kids and was going to be successful down the road. smith said Christiansen is not just a good baseball coach but a good person which Smith recognized in his first meeting with Christiansen PERIOD

My first impression of him was that he was very on top of not just baseball but life Smith said PERIOD He had goals which I was very impressed with PERIOD He knows where he wants to be at in life when hes  and he also has the patience to get there. university of Kansas baseball head coach Ritch Price said if Christiansen ever becomes a head coach again the best piece of advice he would give him is to be patient PERIOD

The hardest thing to do is see the big picture Price said PERIOD You have to have a two three or even a fiveyear plan. price has known Christiansen for eight years and said he still talks to him almost daily PERIOD

Christiansen said he and Smith share a special bond and a relationship that is not typical of a head coach and assistant coach PERIOD

Smith reaffirmed Christiansens statement PERIOD

I think its more of a fatherson relationship than a head coachassistant coach he said PERIOD Thats because our philosophies are so similar. smith said Christiansen goes about things the right way PERIOD

Hes one of the finest young men in college baseball right now he said PERIOD I also think hes one of the finest young coaches in America period PERIOD I think thats a great combination. you have a lot of guys who are really good young coaches yet they havent figured out life PERIOD Hes figured it out Smith said PERIOD
