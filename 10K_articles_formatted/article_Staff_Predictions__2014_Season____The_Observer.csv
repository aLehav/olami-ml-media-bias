Theres plenty of youth plenty of potential and plenty of inconsistency PERIOD There are also quite a few players currently out with injuries who with prompt recoveries could boost the Irish upon their returns PERIOD Basically theres a lot of unknown PERIOD

Still I think Notre Dame is good enough to tally nine wins in the regular season with likely losses against Stanford and Florida State and then one against either Michigan USC or Arizona State PERIOD

Everett Golson will lead a deep and talented offense and an aggressive and young defense will have its share of big plays but also its share of glaring mistakes PERIOD This year it will be the offense that needs to carry the team in games PERIOD

Youth  Notre Dame has a lot of it PERIOD I guess thats to be expected from a team that returns only  starters PERIOD

Young talent will benefit the Irish on offense where Greg Bryant and Tarean Folston should form a formidable backfield and receivers like Corey Robinson and Chris Brown should be appealing targets for a bulkedup Everett Golson PERIOD

On the other side of the ball Notre Dames lack of depth particularly on the defensive line and at linebacker will spell trouble for the Irish PERIOD Look for true freshmen to step up in the teams new defensive scheme but dont expect Notre Dame to escape a difficult October and November slate without a few struggles PERIOD

Theres no question the Irish would like to improve on last seasons campaign PERIOD The question lies in how exactly they will get better PERIOD With a new defensive coordinator a new defensive scheme key losses on the defensive line and players shifting positions Notre Dames defense is hardly a lock to be consistent PERIOD

The landscape looks uncertain on offense as well as Brian Kelly must choose a starting quarterback navigate a stillcrowded backfield and establish the main receiving threats PERIOD

Still questions mean possibilities and the Irish have a great deal of potential PERIOD The key for Notre Dame will be capitalizing on young talent PERIOD If the Irish can do that they should have an excellent season PERIOD

REGULAR SEASON RECORD

Assistant Managing Editor

Call me crazy but the Irish will go undefeated this season  and not twoseasonsagoundefeated when they didnt win the national championship PERIOD

Everett Golson just spent a year with one of the best quarterback coaches in the country PERIOD Tarean Folston Cam McDaniel and Greg Bryant are all more than capable in the backfield and the offensive line is strong and versatile PERIOD

Notre Dames athletic and talentladen defense will not skip a beat after the graduation of Stephon Tuitt and Louis Nix especially under the leadership of new defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder PERIOD Although defending national champion Florida State looks to be the biggest obstacle Notre Dame will finish the season undefeated PERIOD

REGULAR SEASON RECORD 

Mary Green
Sports Editor

The  season will be packed with many changes for the Irish PERIOD Two new coordinators will make their marks on both sides of the ball the fivegame ACC schedule officially begins and a familiar No PERIOD  returns under center PERIOD

However these changes wont be enough for Notre Dame to make its second trip to the national championship game in three years  matchups against Stanford and Florida State assure that PERIOD

But the Irish will find themselves in a better game than the Pinstripe Bowl once the regular season concludes PERIOD A refreshed playbook and the sparks provided by youngyetexperienced players like Jaylon Smith and Tarean Folston and by veterans eager to return to the field from injury will get them there PERIOD
