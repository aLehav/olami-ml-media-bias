Carolina Hurricanes head coach Rod BrindAmour announced Sunday that Jordan Staal would be the next captain of the Carolina Hurricanes with defenseman Jaccob Slavin and forward Jordan Martinook serving as alternate captains PERIOD

During the State of the Canes address before the Carolina Hurricanes final preseason game against the Washington Capitals playbyplay announcer John Forslund spoke with the Hurricanes new goaltender coach Jason Muzzatti BrindAmour and president and general manager Don Waddell PERIOD It was BrindAmour who broke the news PERIOD

BrindAmour said the choice was an obvious one and one he felt was needed PERIOD Heading into the preseason BrindAmour said he was confident in the leadership group already in the room but after going through a few games and reading the room he decided he needed someone to take charge PERIOD

Roddy BrindAmour more or less said You want to be captain and he usually keeps it pretty simple Staal said on BrindAmour approaching him with the decision PERIOD I was excited Im honored and those were the two words that came out of my mouth. staal had served once already as a captain but in a more interesting way PERIOD In the  season former head coach Bill Peters named both Jordan Staal and former defenseman Justin Faulk as cocaptains a very rare situation in the NHL PERIOD This has only happened two other times in  with the Bruins and in  with the Sabres PERIOD

This pair only lasted for the single season as the Hurricanes missed the playoffs for the ninth straight year and Peters left for a head coaching job with the Calgary Flames PERIOD New head coach BrindAmour then stripped the C from both and named Justin Williams captain PERIOD

With Williams stepping away from the game Staal will have the opportunity to prove his value as a lone captain a position his brother Eric Staal held for seven seasons from  PERIOD

I knew if we were going to pick a C Id be in the running Staal said PERIOD Ive been around for a while and I was fortunate enough to wear the A for a few years and I learned a lot from our leaders throughout the years PERIOD Im excited by the new challenge and to play alongside this talented young group. entering his eighth season with the Hurricanes Staal has four years remaining including the one coming up on the 10year contract he signed back in  PERIOD Staal is set to play with the Hurricanes for a long time PERIOD Serving a crucial role as the No PERIOD  centerman Staals contributions both on and off the ice are vitally important to the team PERIOD

Alongside Staal Slavin who has been a calming presence as the No PERIOD  defenseman on the Hurricanes roster since making the jump to the NHL roster in  and Martinook who played his first year for Carolina last year are two obvious choices to bolster the leadership in the room PERIOD

Cant say enough about those two guys Staal said about his two alternates PERIOD I mean Slavo Slavin hes been here for awhile now but just his daytoday is so consistent and obviously his play is what you want to see on the back end and he brings it every game PERIOD Marty Martinook is no different PERIOD Hes a guy that wears his heart on his sleeve and shows up to work PERIOD Those are the guys you want to follow and be around. while other teams such as the Edmonton Oilers and Buffalo Sabres have named their  NHL draft superstars as captains the Hurricanes decided to go in a different direction PERIOD

Sebastian Aho who the Canes drafted in the second round of the  draft will not be wearing a letter for Carolina but it isnt a slight to him or his abilities PERIOD The Hurricanes allstar will have more time to focus on his offensive ability and overall game which the Canes will be relying on more PERIOD

He earned it Aho said when asked about the captaincy PERIOD Hes a great leader and Im so happy for him and to have him as my captain. there should be no worry among fans whether there will be any animosity in the locker room following the decision PERIOD Staal has worn the C before is currently respected in the room and is already becoming one of the most respected captains in the Hurricanes history PERIOD
