8300,2023-10-25,"the Oscars current and former producers Brian Grazer and Brett Ratner at the L.A PERIOD premiere of J PERIOD Edgar. associated Press

In a time span of only almost a week the Academy Awards saw major changes PERIOD

The usually headline free production made a major splash when Brett Ratner the shows producer stepped down from his position PERIOD

The resignation came just days after Ratner made a gay slur at the premiere of his new movie Tower Heist. he did the right thing for the Academy and for himself Tom Sherak the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Arts said PERIOD Words have meaning and they have consequences PERIOD Brett is a good person but his comments were unacceptable PERIOD We all hope this will be an opportunity to raise awareness about the harm that is caused by reckless and insensitive remarks regardless of the intent. just days after Ratners leave the shows host comedian Eddie Murphy also announced that he too would be leaving his post at the Academy Awards PERIOD

First and foremost I want to say that I completely understand and support each partys decision with regard to a change of producers for this years Academy Awards ceremon Murphy said in a statement released by the Academy PERIOD I was truly looking forward to being a part of the show that our production team and writers were just starting to develop but Im sure that the new production team and host will do an equally great job. to replace Ratner the Academy enlisted the help of Brian Grazer PERIOD

Grazer ironically was Ratners producer for Tower Heist. brian Grazer is a renowned filmmaker who over the past  years has produced a diverse and extraordinary body of work Sherak said PERIOD He will certainly bring his tremendous talent creativity and relationships to the Oscars. with the producing slot filled the Academy shifted their focus onto finding a host PERIOD

Replacing Murphy as the eighty-fourth Annual Academy Awards host is Billy Crystal PERIOD

This year will mark Crystals ninth time as the shows host PERIOD Crystal last hosted in  PERIOD

Im thrilled to welcome Billy back to the Oscar stage Sherak said PERIOD Hes a comic legend and Oscar icon and it feels good to have him back where he belongs. as the news broke Crystal tweeted I am doing the Oscars so the young woman in the pharmacy will stop asking my name when I pick up my prescriptions PERIOD Looking forward to the show. the Independent Voice of Southern Methodist University Since
