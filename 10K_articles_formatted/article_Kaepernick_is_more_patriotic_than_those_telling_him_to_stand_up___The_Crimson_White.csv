7969,2023-10-23,"by now you might be tired of reading about Colin Kaepernick PERIOD You might think the issue has been overdrawn dragged out by the media just looking for a controversial story PERIOD You might be tired of football commentators bringing every NFL games halftime coverage back to event that happened before kickoff PERIOD The events of the last few days prove that the story is far from over though and needs more attention now than ever PERIOD

The killings of two black men Terrence Crutcher and Keith Lamont Scott have reignited the debate over police brutality that emerges periodically now in the American media cycle PERIOD While these specific cases are under investigation they and the many similar cases that have come before them prove time and time again that racial issues are not over in our country and something needs to be done about the statesponsored violence the black community faces PERIOD

Kaepernick kneels because he recognizes these problems PERIOD He kneels because he is issuing a call to action to change the oppressive structures surrounding black Americans PERIOD He kneels because he knows that the flag is supposed to represent freedom and justice and he wants it to do that for all Americans PERIOD He kneels because he cares about America PERIOD And thus his kneeling shows that he is more patriotic than those yelling at him to stand up PERIOD Patriotism isnt passive PERIOD Patriotism is actively trying to shape your country into the best nation it can possibly be it is trying to ensure that we live up to the ideals of democracy and liberation that our founding fathers stood for PERIOD No institution can ever be perfect including the American government so recognizing and actively trying to remedy those flaws is a crucial part of the democratic process PERIOD As author and businessman Steven Covey said Love is a verb and the same is true for love of country PERIOD

What patriotism is not is a blind acceptance of Americas virtuosity and worth PERIOD That is more akin to fascism a concept that is bordered very closely by unexamined nationalism PERIOD Sometimes though this type of patriotism is the easiest PERIOD If we refuse to acknowledge any problems in our nation then we dont have to expend any effort to try and fix them PERIOD Many white Americans can live comfortably in this ignorant bliss this passive nationalism when it comes to the case of police brutality PERIOD But America and democracy at large are built on community on a large and diverse group of people coming together to ensure that government is not tyrannical PERIOD In our country if freedom does not exist for all it can exist for none PERIOD Demanding respect for a flag and a country that does not currently stand for the values it was founded upon is not patriotic PERIOD Ignoring someones right to freedom of speech and freedom of protest is not patriotic PERIOD Anyone can stand and place their hands over their hearts for a minute and half  what takes real love of country is shirking a tradition and facing incredible backlash to advocate for change and reform PERIOD So if you want to continue to criticize and crucify Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem stop hiding your hatred behind patriotism and call it what it really is  racism PERIOD
