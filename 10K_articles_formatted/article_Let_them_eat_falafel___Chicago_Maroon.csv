2216,2022-03-16,"we Middle Easterners take our food seriouslyperhaps too seriously PERIOD Refusing to eat my mothers Persian dishes is tantamount to spitting in her face learning how to make the perfect chai is a rite of passage in my household PERIOD Indeed it is nothing new that food brings people together or tears us apart PERIOD

In the Middle Ages Christian societies singled out and alienated Jews for not eating pork when in fact this originally was not a distinctly Jewish custom PERIOD Back in the ancient Near East the Israelites shared the custom with the Egyptians and other Semitic peoples PERIOD Later when Jews traveled from Middle Eastern countries to Spain they brought the eggplant with them and were singled out again this time as eggplant eaters PERIOD By the seventeenth century the eggplant was dubbed the Jews apple in England as it was adored by Spanish Jews who brought it with them after their expulsion from Spain PERIOD

We all know of the everlasting IsraeliArab conflict but recently the quarrel has expanded to a food fight over claims of ownership of regional dishes PERIOD

A few weeks ago University of Chicago Friends of Israel UCFI hosted an Israel Independence Day celebration on Bartlett quad featuring falafel hummus Hebrew music and free henna tattoos PERIOD Where UCFI was Students for Justice in Palestine SJP followed protesting the celebration. the demonstration didnt bother me PERIOD In fact I was happy to hear their side of the story their activist fervor and a healthy exercise of free speech PERIOD

But two days later an article titled U of Chicago Students Protest Cultural Appropriation Misinformation at Israel Independence Day Event was published on the site Sixteen Minutes to Palestine containing the following passage

Students on campus found the appropriation of Arab and Palestinian products and cultural elements to be offensive PERIOD The event presented falafel as an Israeli dish improperly attributed the art of henna to Israel and even featured a taxidermied camel PERIOD SJP members and others expressed concern over the blatant orientalization and distortion of Palestinian culture meant to energize these kinds of events. followed by the pice de rsistance

For what its worth this is not the first time proIsrael student groups have fetishized camels as part of their celebrations. this isnt the first time Israel and Jews have been accused of hummuswashingtheft of Palestinian culture. such carping would be amusing here if it didnt contradict the fact that Middle Eastern Jews have always eaten falafel and hummus PERIOD In the wake of the founding of the State of Israel Jews of Arab nations were quickly targeted for revenge PERIOD Thus seeking refuge most of these ancient communities in Libya Syria Egypt Yemen and Iraq fled to Israel bringing their culinary traditions with themincluding scrumptious falafel recipes PERIOD

Just last month Forbes published the Middle East version of the McDonalds indexThe Falafel Indexto assess purchasing power in the Middle East PERIOD There the falafelas opposed to the Big Macis the quotidian dish youll find on the street PERIOD Included with Palestine and Israel on this falafelnomics list are Syria Iraq Jordan Lebanon and Moroccoall countries which housed strong Jewish populations that made their way to Israel PERIOD Cuisine often described as Palestiniankibbe majadra stuffed grape leaves cabbage and zucchini stuffed leg of lambare all admittedly delicious but barely unique to Palestine rather they are shared by most societies of the Levant the Eastern Mediterranean PERIOD Israel herself doesnt have one dish she is a country made up of indigenous people as well as immigrants from all corners of the world PERIOD If you walk into the shuk market youll find a plethora of European schnitzels and bourekas next to halva and jachnun hailing from the east PERIOD

And what if Israel had not adopted the Mediterranean cuisine of the region Would Israelis not be accused of being supremacists imposing their white European culture on an already rich culinary tradition

Similarly for thousands of years henna has been and still is an important part of Middle Eastern Jewry PERIOD My Jewish friendswhose origins trace back to the Maghreb the Levant the Mediterranean basinthe Arabian Peninsula andWestern CentralandSouthern Asiahave traditional henna parties before weddings PERIOD Not to mention the biblical Song of Solomon in which the lover purrs a cluster of hennaflowers is my beloved to me in the vineyards of EinGedi  PERIOD

And as for that taxidermied camelhow did they know about my camel fetish No camels were harmed in the making of this article or the UCFI event at present time only artificial camel skins could be found. it started with reading the stories of Abraham Jacob and Joseph where these domesticated pack animals are mentioned over twenty times PERIOD When Abraham expeditions to Egypt Pharaoh offers him a huge gift including livestock servants andof coursecamels to purchase Abrahams wife Sarah PERIOD But my favorite camel tale is a true love story in which Rebecca is chosen as a wife for Isaac because she offers water to Abrahams servant as well as his camels until they will have finished drinking Genesis  PERIOD From the presence of these stories alone it is apparent that camels are as integral a part of Israeli history as of Palestinian culture PERIOD

In the end though these accusations leave me disappointed more than anything PERIOD Israelis Jews Palestinians and Arabs share a beautiful cultural past and presentwhy not use the potential of a rich shared culture not to point fingers but to nourish progress When it comes to falafel whats mine is yours and whats yours is minethis chickpea delight doesnt belong to SJP or UCFI rather its a treasured piece of both Palestinian and Israeli heritage PERIOD Forget hummuswashing lets have some falafeldiplomacy PERIOD So take this as an open invitation to any member of SJP Id personally like to take you out for falafel or maybe shakshouka PERIOD
