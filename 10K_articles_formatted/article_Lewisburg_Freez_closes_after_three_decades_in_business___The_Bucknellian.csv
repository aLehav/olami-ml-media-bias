The Lewisburg Freez closed its doors permanently on Aug PERIOD  after  years in business PERIOD

We have always believed that we wanted to make a great product that was affordable for our customers The Freez wrote in a public Facebook post PERIOD With rent increases this would no longer be possible PERIOD Because of this the land owners have decided that they want to move forward with plans that do not include the Freez. the news came on Aug PERIOD  a few months following a Facebook post that said the store was experiencing some staffing issues PERIOD Due to those staffing issues they initially wrote the store would maintain limited hours until the positions were filled PERIOD

The Freez had been serving the Lewisburg community and students for years as a seasonal ice cream stand PERIOD Many students shared a similar sentiment that the Freez was not just a business but a place of the schools community PERIOD

Im saddened that a core part of our community is being taken away Hannah Schultheis  said PERIOD

Its devastating PERIOD Every time I drive by the Freez I see a bunch of people congregating and communicating and enjoying ice cream together Jack Chase  said PERIOD

Although the Freez wanted to maintain their affordable products one student said they would be willing to pay more just to keep the Freez around PERIOD

I know there arent a ton of ice cream spots in Lewisburg there is the frozen yogurt place but Lewisburg Freez was a destination and a part of Bucknells identity Carter Raleigh  said PERIOD I think its a really unfortunate situation PERIOD If the Freez was to raise prices I would still be willing to pay. the Freez was not affiliated with the university but many students felt that it was a part of the off campus experience  and even an honorary part of the University PERIOD

When you take away the Freez you take away a part of Bucknell Chase added PERIOD

Its sad Im a junior I remember going there for freshmen orientation PERIOD Ive gone there every year it was definitely a staple of Lewisburg Madison McCormack  said PERIOD
