December  

A Chico State biological sciences lecturer is working to further Wildcats knowledge on elephants through a new class PERIOD

Rebecca Brunelli and Tag Engstrom a biological sciences professor created BIOL  to build elephant knowledge and establish an elephant preserve in Tehama County PERIOD

Brunellis gains in her personal and professional life are resounding but they all came with a certain perspective PERIOD Shes hopeful for the preserves success PERIOD

A positive attitude is everything PERIOD It can help you deal with obstacles in your life PERIOD Instead of viewing them as failures look at them as challenges you can overcome she said PERIOD

The overall yearly conditions in Northern California are similar to that of Southern Africa PERIOD The rolling hills will provide a semiwild environment for these highly social animals and accommodate for them being longdistance migrators PERIOD

I love teaching but Im also always keeping my eyes open for additional opportunities to work with animals and thats why Im excited about the Tembo Preserve Brunelli said PERIOD

The high standard of care given to these elephants by the Tembo Preserve the Oakland Zoo and Chico State could yield incredible outcomes in terms of research development that include but are not limited to

The Tembo Preserve Foundation is committed to the conservation of African elephants in the wild PERIOD They are dedicated to creating a  acre elephant preserve in Northern California to provide a natural environment for elephants as well as inspires appreciation supports research and develops innovative methods for supporting conservation according to its website PERIOD

Chico could possibly become the place to learn about elephants and attract a large population of prospective students both nationally and internationally PERIOD

Bringing the Tembo Preserve could mean huge results for Chico State and the science department PERIOD Chico could possibly become the place to learn about elephants and attract a large population of prospective students both nationally and internationally PERIOD

The preserve alongside the Oakland Zoo who will oversee daytoday operations will also provide a more suitable habitat for captive African elephants with larger territories and variations in diet PERIOD

Elephant populations have dropped drastically from nearly . million in  to  today PERIOD For students who want to help the grassroots efforts of Tembo Preserve spring  registration is still open for the elephant behavior and conservation class PERIOD

The class will offer  seats for students interested in learning more PERIOD

Brunelli suggests that the prospective students watch the new Netflix documentary The Ivory Game to learn more about the current dire elephant situation PERIOD
