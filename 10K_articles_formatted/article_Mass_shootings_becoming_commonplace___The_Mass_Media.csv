1772,2023-10-30,"i had a pretty shocking revelation yesterday when news broke of the Navy Yard shooting in Washington PERIOD I looked at the blaring headlines on my computer and I thought Oh great another one. thats right mass shootings have become so common in this country that Im almost used to seeing them come up in the headlines PERIOD It didnt look any different than McDonalds trying out healthy line of wraps or Anthony Weiner ruins another campaign. this is how you know you have an epidemic on your hands when it seems almost run of the mill PERIOD
Thats not to say that this isnt a horrible or senseless tragedy because it certainly is PERIOD A dozen people lost their lives simply for being somewhere PERIOD They did nothing wrong rather they were being good service members the people who deserve the most praise and respect out of any of us PERIOD
But with this new breed of criminal thats come on the scene in the last decade and a half the mass shooter it doesnt seem to matter how good a person you are PERIOD Its not about you PERIOD Its about one sicko that wants to make news on his way out and you just happen to be around at the time PERIOD
That is the scariest part about mass shootings the fact that youve done nothing wrong but youre still a target PERIOD Not only did the victims never wrong the gunman who will not be named in this editorial they most likely never met him PERIOD
The sad truth is that weve entered into an era in this country where we cant go out to the movies to the mall to work or to school without having some terrible thoughts in the back of our mind PERIOD Innocent bystanders were never targeted like this in past generations but now we are becoming prey in these rampages and there arent many practical things we can do to stop it PERIOD No putting an armed guard in every school is not practical for you NRA supporters PERIOD
As far as legislation is concerned thats looking as bleak as ever PERIOD The problem is that America is the gun country PERIOD In other developed nations guns are not a part of everyday life as they are here PERIOD In Germany police fired less than  bullets last year and  of those shots were warning shots PERIOD
Meanwhile in Times Square this week police shot a man for pointing two fingers at them in a gun shape. just over the weekend in Boston nine people died from gunshot wounds but gun control is an issue most politicians wont touch with a 10foot pole PERIOD
Republicans and Democrats tend not to agree on much but they can both agree on guns PERIOD There needs to be a party that takes a more hardline stance on guns and pushes not just for small improvements like background checks and waiting periods but tougher guidelines on whos allowed to own a weapon PERIOD Personally I think the legal age to own a gun should be  but I know at the present time thats not realistic PERIOD
The area where we can make a real impact in preventing attacks like these is mental health PERIOD If you know someone whos going through a rough patch or someone whos being tormented in school reach out to them PERIOD
Give them some attention because thats the same attention thats being sought out in horrible extreme ways PERIOD As of right now thats the best way to stop these incidents PERIOD
