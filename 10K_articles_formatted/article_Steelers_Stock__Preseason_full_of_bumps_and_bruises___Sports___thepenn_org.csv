The Pittsburgh Steelers defensive woes continued in a  loss to the Buffalo Bills Saturday PERIOD

The Bills quarterbacks went 30of33 on pass attempts for  yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers while the running game added  yards and another three touchdowns PERIOD The Steelers defense struggled early letting up  yards and two touchdowns in just the first six plays of the game PERIOD

Injuries took a toll on Pittsburgh again with linebacker Bud Dupree foot kicker Garrett Hartley hamstring and former California University of Pennsylvania wide receiver C.J PERIOD Goodwin broken ribs all leaving the game due to injury PERIOD

Duprees injury isnt expected to be serious and he should be able to play in the final preseason game against the Carolina Panthers PERIOD

Hartley however doesnt look good head coach Mike Tomlin said PERIOD

After the injury to Hartley the Steelers and Jaguars made a trade to remedy the kicker problems Pittsburgh has been having by acquiring Josh Scobee for a  sixthround pick PERIOD

Scobee is most remembered by sinking a 59yard field goal to beat the Indianapolis Colts in  PERIOD That kick would be the longest field goal in Heinz Field history PERIOD

Shortly after the game the Steelers announced wide receiver Martavis Bryants fourgame suspension for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse PERIOD Bryant was pegged by many to have a breakout year after having eight touchdowns and  catches in  games last season PERIOD

The wide receiver position is now down to Antonio Brown and Markus Wheaton with Darrius HeywardBey and Sammie Coates locked in to make the 53man roster PERIOD Goodwin would have had a chance to make the roster but now Shakim Phillips will likely make the roster due to the Bryant suspension and be designated to practice squad once Bryant comes back PERIOD

Look for Wheaton to play a huge role in the first four games of the season as he will be on the opposite side of Brown PERIOD Wheaton has been productive in the time he has played with four catches for  yards and a touchdown to go along with a twopoint conversion so far in the preseason PERIOD

Michael Vick had a strong start in his first preseason game going 4of5 with  yards passing against the Bills connecting with Bryant for a 63yard connection on his first throw PERIOD

The defense struggled in all aspects of the game while some of the linebackers such as Ryan Shazier continued to impress with six tackles and Terrance Garvin led both teams with nine PERIOD

The Steelers also restructured the contracts of Brown tight end Heath Miller and kicker Shaun Suisham to clear  million in cap space PERIOD Brown was rewarded with  million more for  in signing bonuses bringing his total to  million PERIOD

The  players the Steelers cut this week were as follows offensive linemen Miles Dieffenbach Colin Rahrig and Kevin Whimpy wide receivers Kenzel Doe and C.J PERIOD Goodwin running back Braylon Heard defensive linemen Joe Kruger Joe Okafor and Niko Davis defensive backs Jordan Sullen andIan Wild and tight ends Cam Clear and Ray Hamilton PERIOD

Final cuts for the 53man roster must be made by Saturday at  p.m. and the practice squad will start to be formed on Sunday at noon PERIOD
