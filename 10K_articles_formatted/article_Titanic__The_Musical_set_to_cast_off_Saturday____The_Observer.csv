Tae Andrews  Friday January  

Under the tagline a familiar story told a whole new way director Kyle Chamberlin and the rest of the Titanic the Musical crew cast off with two performances this Saturday night in the Ballroom of the LaFortune Student Center PERIOD

As the first performance put on by Fortnight Productions Titanic differs vastly from nearly every other campus production in one regard  the cast and crew will have staged the entire show from auditions to performances in just two weeks PERIOD Talk about a whole new way of telling a familiar story PERIOD

Given how busy many Notre Dame students are Fortnight Productions provides another theater venue for wouldbe performers who might not otherwise have the time to commit to a fullscale production PERIOD The cast read and sang through the show for the first time on Jan PERIOD  and then went through scheduled rehearsals for  of the next  days PERIOD With the accelerated production schedule the extremely tight timetable forced the production staff to be flexible and adapt to various challenges as they arose PERIOD

Despite the many challenges of staging Titanic on two weeks notice Chamberlin said he has enjoyed the experience of directing the ship PERIOD It has been particularly rewarding to help a group of talented intelligent experienced performers do something that none of us have ever done before he said PERIOD

Chamberlin went on to say that he listened to the soundtrack for Titanic The Musical well before he ever saw the show onstage PERIOD When he finally did see the show the performance didnt live up to his expectations PERIOD With so many people on board that fateful voyage there was a host of compelling stories he said PERIOD I felt there was an opportunity to do so much more with the story. one of the stories the show does not include is the story arc played out Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the movie version of Titanic. neither Jack or Rose are anywhere to be found in our production and if you want to hear My Heart Will Go On you best bring your mp3 player Chamberlin said PERIOD Instead of trying to compete with the grandeur of the movie we left the focus on our talent and the music. titanic The MusicalLaFortune BallroomSaturday at  and  p.m.Admission Free
