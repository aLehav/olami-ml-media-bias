Veterans attend a class to expand their business skills in the Wehner Building PERIOD

For veterans with disabilities starting a business can seem daunting PERIOD Entrepreneurship Boot Camp an eightday residency program for veterans eases those hesitations PERIOD

As one of eight campuses nationally AM is hosting  veterans who throughout the week are teamed with mentors coaches professors and veterans who previously participated in the EBV program to learn the skills necessary to achieve their entrepreneurial goals PERIOD

The veteran unemployment rate is about twice where the normal civilian rate is said Richard Lester director of the Entrepreneurship Boot Camp for Veterans and clinical associate professor at Mays Business School PERIOD

Through Saturday veterans will receive oneonone time to discuss business planning creativity and innovation marketing management and opportunity recognition with local community mentors in a classroom setting PERIOD

Their goal by the end of the week is to develop a onepage business plan for their business and a presentation of ten minutes to give to their mentors Lester said PERIOD

This year Lester and his graduate students in the Masters of Human Resources program at the Mays School reviewed  applications from Texas New Mexico Louisiana and Oklahoma selecting  for the program PERIOD

Once accepted the threestage process begins with an online program for three weeks a residency program on AMs campus for eight days and then a 12month aftercare program PERIOD

Lester said one of the many benefits of the program is the Aggie networks involvement with the veterans and the services received long after the program is over PERIOD

One of the comments we always get every year is that I never knew that any place like this existed in the United States Lester said PERIOD Its so very powerful to the veterans to see a very strong military connection PERIOD We showcase our University very well and theyre very appreciative of it. lester said that the business schools involved in the program are all tierone worldclass research universities making the selection process very competitive PERIOD There are three criteria that apply to being accepted into the program PERIOD

The first is that youve been on active duty since  Lester said PERIOD We do that because that is the most at risk veteran population right now PERIOD The second criteria are that you have a serviceconnected disability thats verified and validated by the Veterans Administration PERIOD The third criteria is that you want to start your own business PERIOD Those are the minimum qualifications PERIOD The extraordinary qualifications is if youve demonstrated some interest and effort in accomplishing your entrepreneurship goal. lester said that after a pilot program at Syracuse University was launched in  a few other schools joined to spread the program throughout the nation PERIOD

Texas AM was one of the few schools to launch the EBV program following Lester said PERIOD

Lester said there are many opportunities for the veterans to socialize during the program PERIOD

Wednesday the local 4H youth development organization hosted a dinner and students from the 4H group gave letters to the veterans thanking them for their service PERIOD

They get to hear the stories of the veterans Lester said PERIOD Its a very very powerful evening its great PERIOD The 4H mothers cook dinner for us its basically a church social is what I call it. gary Blair head coach of the AM womens basketball team will speak during dinner at the Traditions Club on Thursday evening PERIOD Saturday a dinner will be held George Bush Presidential Dining Room at the Annenberg Center where there will be a bagpipe performance and Ross Volunteers will attend PERIOD

Kevin Doffing Class of  and EBV program student said the veterans were enthusiastic about being on AMs campus PERIOD

As a former student Ive seen EBV really build it up Doffing said PERIOD The vets are real excited PERIOD I was a Fish Camp counselor for four years and these guys and girls throw out Howdy with more enthusiasm than a fourthday fish Doffing said PERIOD

Jesse Slone of New Orleans Louisiana and student in the EBV program said that the work hasnt been too overwhelming but it has been a good challenge PERIOD

Its exciting Slone said PERIOD Its really nice that it pushes you right to the edge of what you can keep up with PERIOD Texas AM in general has been very welcoming and very supportive PERIOD You can see that everyone participating in the program can see they are very happy to be able to participate and really give us everything they can so thats been very nice. the startup businesses should benefit both the veterans and other veterans looking for job opportunities Lester said PERIOD

One of the things that I see that happens is that by and large the majority of them want to help other disabled veterans Lester said PERIOD So many times we see businesses and we see that they think how can we pay it forward Lester said PERIOD

Doffing said although he currently is a part of his familys business he appreciated the coaching and mentoring offered by the program and said it could only make his skills stronger PERIOD

Its refreshing from time to time and look back at your business objectively and have other people look at it and tell you what you need to do better Doffing said PERIOD Because no matter how good you get at your business it can always be better. log In
