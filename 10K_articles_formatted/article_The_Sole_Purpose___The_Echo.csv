9618,2020-12-12,"sole Hope at California Lutheran University is a new club that provides students with the opportunity to make a global difference PERIOD

Sole Hope is an already standing organization a nonprofit organization Janelle Garland president of Sole Hope at Cal Lutheran said PERIOD The mission of Sole Hope is to prevent footrelated disease in Africa and they do that through sustainability education and relief. when Garland found the organizations website she got in contact with their team and made it possible to start a chapter of Sole Hope at Cal Lutheran PERIOD

I believe this is the first one on a college campus and the organization was willing to work with us to make that happen so thats been really great Sole Hope faculty adviser Samuel Thomas said PERIOD

A huge part of Sole Hopes mission is raising awareness of a footrelated disease in Africa PERIOD In Africa jiggers or sand fleas are the source of foot diseases PERIOD These fleas burrow into human feet and lay eggs within the exposed flesh PERIOD

The people that Sole Hope reaches out to cannot afford shoes so they have no protection from exposure to the fleas PERIOD This organization intends to promote change in Africa by providing shoes to those that dont have the resources or money to get them otherwise PERIOD

Sole Hope holds supply drives and shoe cutting events to create products from recycled materials PERIOD The products created are then shipped overseas to children in Africa PERIOD

Its an organization that attempts to reuse materials especially denim and then create new products out of those PERIOD Typically shoes that then will go to people in need in poor areas Thomas said PERIOD

Garland and Vice President Rebecca Callahan are currently in the beginning stages of developing this servicedriven club on campus PERIOD Garland and Callahan thought Sole Hopes goals and vision would fit well with Cal Lutherans serviceoriented mission PERIOD

This cause just really seems like an interesting and good thing to do Callahan said PERIOD

It creates community here among people who volunteer and get together and participate in what they call cutting parties and the preparation of the materials and the making of the shoes Thomas said PERIOD

As the club is very new Garland and Callahan have set a series of both shortandlongterm goals for this new chapter of Sole Hope at Cal Lutheran PERIOD

One of them is definitely to get some awareness on campus about the cause and the mission of Sole Hope in general Callahan said PERIOD Then also to make a great impact and greatly help Sole Hope by having enough cutting parties or tracing parties where we can get them enough material so they can make shoes. the events to be held at Cal Lutheran will aid in the process of getting materials to Sole Hope and more importantly shoes to the children in Africa PERIOD

I think the student Janelle Garland who approached me about it and who Ive been working with to get the club up and running felt like that could be something that fits really well with student interest here and with the mission of the university Thomas said PERIOD

Garland and Callahan will be setting up donation areas on campus where students and faculty will be able to drop off materials to be processed and sent to Sole Hope PERIOD

All students are welcome and encouraged to join and participate in the involvement with this nonprofit organization PERIOD

We have the main positions filled but if anybody ever wanted to help out and be an officer that would be great PERIOD Or if they just want to be a member that would also be greatGarland said PERIOD

Students interested in involvement with this club can reach out to Garland and Callahan through their Facebook page Sole Hope at CLU. jennifer Birch
