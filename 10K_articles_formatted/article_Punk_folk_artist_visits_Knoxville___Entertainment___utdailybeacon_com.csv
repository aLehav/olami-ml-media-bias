I feel the burn on the backs of my ankles and wonder what Ani

DiFranco would say PERIOD Im  and just wearing my first pair of black

leather boots PERIOD Im not turning punk just thinking realistically about

the rest of winter and every wicked puddle that ruined my last pair of

boots PERIOD But with my feet strapped in English leather and every step

cushioned with rubber soles I feel like I can rule the world PERIOD Im

even strutting a little down sidewalks humming a song  Forget my blisters

DiFranco and her music have that kind of effect on peoplelike new

boots that hurt so good PERIOD The honesty and emotion she expresses

overwhelm PERIOD 

Truth according to Ani can be catharticlike hearing your life in a

song and feeling a sudden wash of comprehension like realizing why

you left PERIOD Maybe its her dedication to that honesty thats kept her from

signing with any of the number of major labels that have courted her PERIOD

 she told Guitar

magazine 

With her funky hair and her  Rush Limbaugh would

probably call her a femiNazi. then again Ani would eat him for lunch PERIOD

Yum PERIOD

Since her musical career began at age nine DiFranco has been her

own distributor PERIOD And since  her label Righteous Babe Records

has released seven discs and sold more than  PERIOD Recently shes been

featured in Rolling Stone and on MTV PERIOD Not too shabby for someone who

sold tapes out of the back of her VW Bug PERIOD Her slew of fans across the

country handle promotion matters they do as good a job as any major label

could PERIOD Maybe better PERIOD

What DiFranco does has been called punk folkfor the way she

assaults the acoustic guitar with all the fury of a hardcore

percussionist and uses language without fear PERIOD Shes equally intense

with her voice at times pushing the boundaries of what sounds  and

what might make you cringe PERIOD Her sound is aggressive and smartly angry

poignant and tender sometimes all in the same song PERIOD Shes sexier and

scarier than Madonna and  times more lovable PERIOD Ill tell you one

thing Alanis and Tori should be falling on their knees to worship Ani PERIOD And

so should you PERIOD Shes going to put on a kickbooty show tonight at  p.m PERIOD

at Flamingos PERIOD Tickets are just  in advance and  at the door PERIOD So watch

your head buster Im wearing my boots and those blisters are long

gone PERIOD
