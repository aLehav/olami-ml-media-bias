2410,2023-11-04,"gov PERIOD Pat Quinn announced his proposal Thursday to close seven state prisons and facilities for the mentally ill laying of more than  employees in the process PERIOD Quinn said the closures are a result of the reduced budget approved by the Illinois Legislature PERIOD

State Rep PERIOD Naomi Jakobsson D103 criticized the governor for not being active in the budgetmaking process PERIOD She said this is not the first time Quinn has tried to shut down facilities as a way to cut back and threaten the General Assembly PERIOD

Most of these facilities except for Tinley Park are downstate and when you threaten an agency in a very small community downstate it affects the whole community she said PERIOD If that facility were to shut down the economy of that would really suffer PERIOD So its a frightful thing the governor has done. jakobsson also said Quinn could have been more active in the budgetmaking process if he wanted to save the state money PERIOD She said Quinn rejected a different budget proposal that had bipartisan support in favor of the current budget PERIOD

Champaign Mayor Don Gerard was also critical of the governors plan PERIOD



Its calamitous to the health of our communities when those who cannot care for ourselves are left to their own devices he said PERIOD

Gerard also said closing these facilities will have a ripple effect on the entire community and economy which is especially bad when trying to avoid a doubledip recession PERIOD He said he is glad the state government is finally trying to deal with the deficit but he does not think the governors plan is the correct way to go about it PERIOD

Gerards counterpart in Urbana Mayor Laurel Prussing was less critical of the governor PERIOD

I think Quinn is living up to the limits that the legislature has imposed on him she said PERIOD I dont think he wants to cut these agencies  they just didnt appropriate the money. state Rep PERIOD Jason Barickman R105compared Quinns actions to those of former Gov PERIOD Rod Blagojevich when he tried to shut down the Pontiac Correctional Center to save money PERIOD

Now we hear Gov PERIOD Quinn trying to use a similar strategy with Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln and Im concerned that decision could have equally dangerous consequences for our entire correctional system Barickman said in a press release PERIOD

I think what has become clear is that Gov PERIOD Quinn does not embrace a responsible calculated approach to fiscal management but instead favors headline grabbing scenarios that are intended to force a manufactured crisis he said PERIOD

The proposal has also drawn fire from labor union The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees or AFSCME for violating a nolayoff agreement PERIOD

Any layoff and any closure would be a direct violation of that agreement said AFSCME Council  spokesman Anders Lindall PERIOD It would be a direct violation of the word the governor gave and AFSCME has shown that we will do whatever is necessary to see that the rights of our members under the contract and under the law are upheld. quinns proposal is not final as it sill must be reviewed by the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability and employees must be given proper notice PERIOD
