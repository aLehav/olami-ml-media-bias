7883,2023-11-01,"the Student Government Association discussed mental health and housing at Tuesdays meeting PERIOD

In light of the recent death of freshman Jocelyn Straus SGA president Emily Solomon proposed the idea of discussing students psychological wellbeing on campus PERIOD

Im not necessarily aiming for SGA to do something in direct response to Strauss death said the sophomore visual and media arts major PERIOD Im more looking at this issue as a whole to discuss what are things that our campus can do to foster a better environment and prevent students from feeling so overwhelmed. gabriela Kula class of  senator talked about the feedback she has received on mental health from her peers PERIOD She said that representatives from the class of  sent out a survey to their class in midOctober asking them what general issues they would like to be addressed PERIOD While she said that there wasnt a high number of responses the issue that her class thought needed to be worked on the most was mental health PERIOD

The conversation segued into suggestions to improve Emersons oncampus housing arrangements PERIOD Vice president Kassandra King proposed a new way to look at freshman residence hall assignments suggesting that the Little Building become an almost entirely freshman dorm with spillover only going into Paramount and Piano Row not Colonial. king a senior political communication major and Little Building resident assistant said that shes has this idea since becoming an RA last year PERIOD

The way Colonial is set up is not conducive to freshman learning King said PERIOD Ive never thought that it was. king spoke about the social aspect of the Little Building and her experience living there as a freshman PERIOD She said she was depressed during her first year but where she lived although not her first choice was ultimately beneficial PERIOD

It was always good to know you were coming home to somebody King said PERIOD

Further suggestions from King included allowing upperclassmen to remain in suites in the Little Building and only assigning freshmen single rooms under special circumstances like those pertaining to gender or disabilities PERIOD She said that there are double rooms small enough to be converted to single rooms and others large enough to be converted to triple rooms if demand called for it PERIOD

Class of  senator Victoria Loubert proposed making Colonial solely for upperclassmen PERIOD Jasmine Reyes the elections chair agreed with the suggestion PERIOD

Considering there were only  freshmen who were moved into Colonial during orientation week said the junior journalism major it kind of seems pointless to have them living there at all. cancel reply
