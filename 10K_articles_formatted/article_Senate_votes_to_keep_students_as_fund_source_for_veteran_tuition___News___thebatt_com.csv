Amid the different costs to attend Texas AM one in particular is being brought up for reconsideration PERIOD

The Hazlewood Act a bill that provides qualified veterans their spouses and dependent children with an educational benefit at Texas public colleges and universities has caused an unsettling among some students PERIOD

With assistance from Hazlewood qualified veterans receive exemption from up to  hours of tuition and major fee charges PERIOD The tuition and fees of current students at the universities fund the veterans tuitions PERIOD

Texas AM Student Senate voted on a bill Wednesday that requested for a reevaluation of the Hazlewood Act in order for it to become funded through the state and not through the students of Texas AM PERIOD

We want the state to know we cant keep shouldering the burden of paying for veterans tuition said Brody Smith senior history major PERIOD We need to make sure programs that support veterans are not detrimental to students in any way PERIOD

Student Senate voted the Hazlewood Act Bill down PERIOD

The state needs to find alternative means of funding Smith said PERIOD State dollars donors or other sources that wont take away money that could be spent on the

University PERIOD

Because the Hazlewood Act is state legislation Taylor Sessions senior agricultural economics major said he feels that it is not the students place to provide funding for it PERIOD

The Hazlewood Act is a state legislation bill but it is not funded by the state Sessions said PERIOD So its putting a tax on the University PERIOD

Although some students say this takes away from what other University expenditures veterans who are current students at AM feel different about the legislation PERIOD

Josh Melendez junior accounting major is a Marine Corps veteran who served from November  to November  and has taken advantage of the opportunity provided to him by the Hazelwood Act PERIOD

Being blessed with the Hazlewood Act is what you look forward to Melendez said PERIOD When youre away you think about when you get back home and how you want to be a better person PERIOD The Hazlewood Act is going to help you and help better your education PERIOD

Melendez said he feels that the legislation should continue to help those who return to school after serving their country PERIOD

If it were taken away that would be devastating Melendez said PERIOD Its something we look forward to PERIOD Its something weve earned PERIOD We are individuals who have protected your freedom PERIOD

Melendez said with so many fees that students pay and dont take advantage of it makes them seem hypocritical

Theyre okay with paying for so many things but cant pay for this Melendez said PERIOD Theyre okay with paying to upkeep Kyle Field and Reed Arena and for the Student Recreation Center that they might not use but not this PERIOD
