By  Northern Star Editorial BoardFebruary  

Do you know what is in the U.S PERIOD Constitution

Do you know all of your rights Do you know what the government can and cannot do to you

Well chances areyou dont know PERIOD

In  the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum released a study showing that more Americans know the five members of the Simpsons family Homer Marge Bart Lisa and Maggie than the five freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment speech press religion assembly and petition for redress of grievances PERIOD

But dont feel bad if you dont know the finer points of government PERIOD Your Student Association senators dont really know their own constitution either PERIOD

Sundays SA Senate was consumed with debate over whether the dismissal of Ryan Smith from the president pro tempore position was constitutional or not PERIOD

Those arguing for his removal point to Section  Part L of the SA bylaws which states that the president pro tempore shall preside over Senate meetings under the direction of the Speaker. so yes we understand where the impression of the president pro tempore serves at the pleasure of the speaker of the senate comes from PERIOD One analogy would be how the chief of staff interacts with the U.S PERIOD president Rahm Emanuel answered only to Barack Obama not Congress PERIOD

But then theres Article  Section  of the SA Constitution which states that theres a specific procedure for removing any officer senator SA representativeor any other member of SA. seven senators need to petition to remove the person in question and at later date a twothirds majority is needed to oust him or her PERIOD

But the SA did not do this on Sunday PERIOD Speaker of the Senate Jeremy Peters said he removed Smith on Friday and he appointed a new president pro tempore PERIOD The question of the evening seemed to be Was it constitutional

Were not constitutional experts but this is getting out of hand PERIOD We closed last semester with the SA being accused of violating the U.S PERIOD Constitution in its verbal battle with the Students for Sensible Drug Policy and now its being accused of violating its own constitution PERIOD

We understand that parts of constitutions can have differing interpretations but you would think that something like officer removal would be clear right

And it doesnt help either that the body is in charge of student money PERIOD Remember the SA is entirely funded by the student fees every NIU student pays PERIOD All the paid positions are funded with student money all of the directors and executives are paid PERIOD

If the SA is going to be in charge of our money it needs to know its own rules PERIOD And if the members are unsure then ask somebody PERIOD They have an adviser and theres plenty of law professors on campus who could probably decipher their constitution PERIOD

Act responsibly please PERIOD
