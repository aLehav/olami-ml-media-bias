The former DeKalb prosecutor joined the EPA she said because I saw this as one more way to protect a community  not from crime but by looking at environmental protection and health. advocacy Keyes Fleming added was what drew her to law in the first place PERIOD

Environmental justice  thats what communities are all about Keyes Fleming said PERIOD She was appointed EPA Region Four Atlanta Administrator by President Barack Obama in September  and rose to Chief of Staff for EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in June  PERIOD

You have to make sure everybody even the poor has access to clean air and clean water and we at the EPA believe a rising tide lifts all boats she said PERIOD

The School of Law alumna spotlighted several of the EPAs early community projects including the Atlanta Beltline a redevelopment of a formerly contaminated railway corridor and Atlantic Station once a steel facility responsible for much of Atlantas air pollution PERIOD

If business was going as usual at the steel facility Atlantic Station would never have been built she said adding that the Department of Transportation was barred from constructing a highway bridge to the site at the time as Atlanta had not yet met the Clean Air Act standards PERIOD The project was completed in  and now boasts a residential population of  and an employee population of  according to the EPA website PERIOD
