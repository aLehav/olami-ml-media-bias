Kurt Cobain and Nirvana pioneered a genre of music that would become the voice of a generation with their first fullfledged album Nevermind. on Saturday Nirvanas multiplatinum album celebrated its 25year anniversary PERIOD
Recognized by many as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time Nevermind not only helped catapult alternative rock into mainstream music but also became a defining component of 90s pop culture PERIOD
Following an 80s decade dense with pop music by the likes of Michael Jackson Madonna and hair metal by bands like Mtley Cre and Def Leppard Nevermind came at a time when people were anxious for something different PERIOD
Nevermind and particularly its lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit were almost singlehandedly responsible for introducing the world to the Seattlebased grunge subgenre PERIOD
Nirvana hadnt invented this genre PERIOD In fact there were already moderately wellknown grunge bands that would later go on to have a lot of success like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam PERIOD
But nobody had the blend of innovation and mainstream appeal that Nirvana did before Nevermind and seemingly overnight classic rock was dead PERIOD
Grunge music wasnt just loud it was angry PERIOD Grunge touched on the same antiestablishment themes of 70s punk music but there was something different about it PERIOD
Its angst and general disinterest in the glamorous lifestyle of rock stars of the past connected with teens and young adults in a way rock couldnt in the 80s PERIOD
Cobain showed that you didnt have to play guitar like Eddie Van Halen to be a rock star PERIOD
The band didnt bother with pyrotechnics and special effects that had become so popular at rock shows at the time PERIOD Not that there was anything wrong with that Cobain would just rather don one of his thrifted cardigans grab a pair of jeans out of the dirty laundry pile turn up his amp and play PERIOD
Stars who otherwise despised the limelight used the platform to call for real sociopolitical reform in movements previously underrepresented or nonexistent in rock PERIOD
Cobain a staunch feminist rejected the idea that women were ever responsible for rape and promoted an antirape education for men PERIOD
Eddie Vedder frontman of Pearl Jam scribbled prochoice on his arm in permanent ink during a performance on MTV PERIOD Grunge gave youth the confidence that it did have a voice and a powerful one at that PERIOD
Another way that Nevermind and Nirvana helped contribute to music at the time that often goes overlooked was by bringing acoustic elements back to the forefront PERIOD This would go on to be a distinguishing factor of 90s music in general PERIOD
Although Nirvana appeared on the show a few years after MTVs creation their  set on MTV Unplugged is arguably the most famous of them all and holds a legacy of its own PERIOD
The acoustic guitar wasnt so uncool anymore PERIOD The fluid transition to a fully acoustic performance which included hits from Nevermind such as Come as You Are and Polly proved not only how dynamic Nirvanas music could be but also how dynamic grunge music could be as a whole PERIOD
Other grunge bands like Stone Temple Pilots and to a much greater degree Alice in Chains would see similar success from their gigs on the show PERIOD
It seems like Kurt Cobain and Nirvana benefit from that large in life larger in death phenomenon that has repeated itself in music history PERIOD
Cobain became the latest member of the  Club and Nirvana subsequently disbanded before anyone could come along and knock them off their pedestal PERIOD
Still even at the height of their fame it was undeniable what Nevermind had done for rock and for a generation of youth who felt hopeless about the future PERIOD
It changed the direction of mainstream music in a way we havent seen since and still resonates with fans  years later PERIOD
