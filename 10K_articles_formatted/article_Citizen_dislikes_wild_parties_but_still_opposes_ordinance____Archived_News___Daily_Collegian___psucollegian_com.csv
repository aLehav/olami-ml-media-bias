In response to the proposed Nuisance Gathering Ordinance I am a senior citizen and a staunch conservative and unsurprisingly I despise rowdy parties PERIOD Recently my daughters home on West Foster Avenue was intruded and trashed by an intoxicated student PERIOD However I oppose a rule that would hold a homeowner or an apartment renter responsible for the illegal behavior of his or her party guests PERIOD

In Nazi Germany the  law held relatives and friends responsible for offenses of persons who could not be arrested by the authorities such as deserters to the enemy or people who fled the country PERIOD The former Soviet Union had a similar law PERIOD

It deeply saddens me that State College politicians would even consider such a fascist and communist idea in holding a person responsible for somebody elses misdeeds and I believe it would be irresponsible for the Borough Council to vote on this rule PERIOD As a conservative I am not very fond of the American Civil Liberties Union PERIOD However in this odd case I appreciate their fight against this unconstitutional and unAmerican rule PERIOD As a naturalized U.S PERIOD citizen I treasure the freedom and the constitutional rights in America PERIOD Such a rule has no place in our country PERIOD
