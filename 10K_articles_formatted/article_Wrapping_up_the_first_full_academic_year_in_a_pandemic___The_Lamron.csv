6368,1970-01-01,"last March the quick and jarring transition to remote learning left many students disappointed with the ending of their academic year and uncertain as to what the next year would look like PERIOD Coming out of the first full year of college in a pandemic students perspectives stayed fairly consistent on several topics but changed slightly with nuances in remote learning and the addition of a new class of students PERIOD

For many students the pandemic influenced where and how they would be able to participate in learning PERIOD Psychology major sophomore Taylor DAgostino is one such student PERIOD

I spent a semester home due to COVID and its impacts on my family and our financial situation  being back on campus Ive seen only a limited amount of people DAgostino said PERIOD It has been tough. students like DAgostino also find the pandemic to be very limiting in terms of general mobility PERIOD Limited study areas and spaces available for people to gather have severely impacted students ability to participate in the oncampus life and culture PERIOD

I miss the ability to go work whenever wherever DAgostino said PERIOD

Other students managed to find a certain amount of freedom in this lack of strictness and physical gathering PERIOD Early childhood education major junior Abigail Wendler noticed that her academic freedom reached a new height since the pandemic began PERIOD

Online learning has opened up a lot of time for me Wendler said PERIOD Im able to make my own schedule and do work whenever I need to or want to during my week. as far as classes go most upperclassmen are yearning for inperson learning to be again PERIOD Students like Wendler miss the inperson connection that accompanies the physical gathering space of a classroom PERIOD

I really miss seeing classmates and professors in person Wendler said PERIOD I miss that time before or after class to talk to my peers and make new friends. dAgostino also noticed a significant difference in the size of the course load being assigned by professors PERIOD

Professors are giving so much more course work than normal as compared to before the pandemic DAgostino said PERIOD

Difficulties in remote learning are something that most students understand PERIOD Biology and psychology double major freshman Lauren Verde had her first year at Geneseo defined by some of these stressors PERIOD

It has been hard to find motivation to learn online with some of the classes I dont like as much Verde said PERIOD Its also hard to miss out on inclass opportunities and meeting students in the classroom. many firstyear students encountered difficulties adjusting to college life outside of the classroom as well PERIOD Freshman childhood special education major Torianna Robleto experienced many frustrations adjusting in their first year during a pandemic including losing many of the experiences they felt would define their freshman year PERIOD

For most of those things I feel like Im still on a waitlist to experience. the pandemic presented sacrifices that critically defined the experiences Robleto and many other freshmen missed coming into Geneseo PERIOD

Were all persevering but in a very melancholy way kind of just surviving Robleto said PERIOD

Despite all the struggles that freshmen faced over the course of this academic year most found a way to cope and maintain an optimistic attitude PERIOD Robleto regardless of their frustrations with the initial transition to COVIDcollege life remains full of hope for the future PERIOD

Similarly Verde has been able to find the good interspersed with the bad and remains positive about her future at Geneseo PERIOD

COVID has had an overall negative affect Verde said PERIOD But Im really fortunate to have found great people regardless and to have found my place here. geneseos student newspaper since  PERIOD
