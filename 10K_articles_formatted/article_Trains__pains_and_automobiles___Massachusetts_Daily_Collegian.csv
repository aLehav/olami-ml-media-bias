There was a lot of news about trains over the summer PERIOD President Obama announced plans to encourage the development of highspeed rail service in this country with  billion allocated to its development by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act PERIOD Earlier in November of  not really the summer but I didnt hear about it until then gazillionaire Warren Buffet bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe one of the largest railroads in the country PERIOD

And why shouldnt they be pumping billions of dollars into this ancient and environmentally friendly industry After all railroads made this country great PERIOD Just think of all the Chinese and Irish laborers who were shamelessly exploited to give prominent politicians a photo op and a big payday PERIOD

Well for one railroads suck PERIOD

When youre on the outside looking in trains are amazing PERIOD I remember being enchanted by them when I was little PERIOD Steam diesel there was even a proposal for a nuclearpowered train at one time PERIOD Whatever the motive power trains were awesome when I was five PERIOD They were big fast made great and easily imitated noises and you never had to worry about choking on toy ones if you put them in your mouth PERIOD

Well Im a lot older now PERIOD Im more knowledgeable and I like to think Im wiser PERIOD Im also more cynical since I made the normal growingup discovery that the real world does not often live up to our imaginings PERIOD Ive ridden in trains of all kinds the MBTA in Boston the WMTA in Washington the New York subway the Philadelphia rail service and Amtrak PERIOD

One of the first things I discovered was that trains are loud cramped and rickety the bathrooms are annoying when there are any theyre always behind schedule and like every form of public transportation there is always a  yearold screaming his or her head off PERIOD

When this happens if youre lucky you get to share a sympathetic look with the parent PERIOD Most of the time however Mom and Dad are completely oblivious PERIOD Not only are they used to it but they have childrearing hormones rushing through their systems which provide immunity PERIOD Some of the things these kids do are absolutely horrendous PERIOD The parents have to be on something PERIOD

I was on the B43 bus to Target the other day PERIOD I swear there was a set of triplets PERIOD They did not stop screaming PERIOD If I could have astrally projected myself into the drivers seat of any car with air conditioning it would have made a great commercial for any car anywhere anytime especially an affordable one PERIOD

We cant ban children from public transportation or require parents to gag their rugrats or even segregate transportation based on a traveler being with or without children all we can do is take the hint and buy the clunker Crazy Phils Used Car Barn is advertising for 500the one with no seatbelts and the weird smell coming from the back seat PERIOD

There has never been a car in my life where the experience was inferior to that of public transit PERIOD Shocks control no screaming kids a radio playing music you actually listen toor even CDs or an iPod or most blessed of all silence PERIOD Just the gentle Vrrrrr of the engine maybe a little bit of chassis vibration and smooth gentle acceleration along the way PERIOD

Another problem with public transit is that the bathrooms are invariably inoperable PERIOD I dont even know why they bother building trains and buses with toilets when they never work PERIOD Im sure ingenuity and engineering could overcome this technological hurdle thats preventing American public transit from competing with Europe but why bother going through the Apollo program all over again With a car you dont have to worry about it PERIOD Guys can use bushes and women can use smart phones to find clean gas stations that arent run by perverts PERIOD

Compared to buses or trains the automobile is paradise on wheels PERIOD With a car you can set your own schedule go on a Great American Road trip be free of the wildly unpredictable and overcrowded buses and trains and in a pinch you can use it as a mobile bachelor pad PERIOD Yeah you have to add on to your debt peonage in order to buy one but its worth it PERIOD I find myself at peace just thinking about never having to listen to a little stinker scream for no reason in particular ever again PERIOD Well at least until I become a parent myself PERIOD For now however my mother has enough nightmares PERIOD
