IOWA CITY Iowa AP  He may have been angry but the Big Ten Conference said Wednesday that Iowa coach Tom Davis was not out of line when he talked about the officiating in the Hawkeyes loss to Michigan State last week PERIOD
Davis was irate after his teams  loss to the Spartans at East Lansing on Feb PERIOD  and talked with reporters for  seconds in which he disagreed with three calls in the closing moments of the game PERIOD The loss dropped Iowa which started the conference season  to  overall  in the Big Ten PERIOD
After listening to the audio tape of the postgame interview session and reviewing related print stories written about the game we have determined that coach Davis comments did not constitute undue criticism of the game officials Kevin Weiberg associate commissioner of the league said in a statement PERIOD
Weiberg said a press account from a Detroit newspaper quoted Davis as saying the game was taken from us. we have determined that this quotation was incorrectly attributed to coach Davis and was not part of his postgame comments Weiberg said PERIOD
Weiberg said it is appropriate for a coach to be able to say they disagree with certain calls by officials but he said they cannot delve into characterizations of officiating decisions that call into question the integrity of the game officials. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
