October  

On Sept PERIOD  I attended the Interfaith Celebration for Peace in the commons that was held as part of Unity in Diversity Week PERIOD

The reason that I attended was to hear NIUs Black Choir PERIOD I had attended one of their performances last spring and was anxiously anticipating hearing them again PERIOD

When they sang out the first note a smile stretched across my face PERIOD I was completely entranced by the incredible music they created PERIOD I only wish that more people were aware of the wonderful talent that the members of the choir possess I urge more people to attend a performance of the Black Choir PERIOD Once you hear them I guarantee that you will smile too PERIOD
