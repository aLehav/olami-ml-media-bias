The University already offers courses in data mining and the Carlson School of Management houses a business analytics graduate program but the new degree will focus more on computer science and teach graduate students to create new techniques for analyzing data PERIOD

We realized we had something to contribute said Dan Boley the new programs graduate director PERIOD We could teach people the skills needed to handle all this data and analyze it. the programs graduates will learn to make sense of large datasets and find patterns within them Boley said PERIOD

Computer science as a degree tends to lack fundamentals for dealing with data he said PERIOD
