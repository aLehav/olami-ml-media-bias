Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 53F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Who else out there hates themselves for taking naptime for granted in preschool Seriously lets band together and start a club PERIOD

I however am not one of you unfortunate insomniacs who stay up late refreshing the home page on Facebook because you have difficulties falling asleep every night PERIOD I just so happen to be a selfdiagnosed hypersomniac that can sleep for hours and still never get enough rest to fully energize me for the day PERIOD

Since I was  I have been compensating for the childhood years of staying awake through scheduled naptime PERIOD It was a little challenging at first because I would nap for at least two hours after school feeling groggy and unmotivated to get any schoolwork done because waking up to darkness meant my day had finished PERIOD

Fortunately I have turned a terrible habit into a lovely pastime by dating sleepdeprived men and enjoying the romantic aspect of falling asleep in their arms PERIOD Theres nothing more beautiful than a heartbeat and rhythmic inhaleandexhale to lull you into a dream PERIOD

But I had no idea there was a downside to falling asleep with someone I loved until I dated two different men on opposite ends of the nap spectrum PERIOD

First there was Ron the insomniac who could thrive off four hours of sleep day after day after exhausting tedious day PERIOD

I dont like that youre always taking naps he would complain PERIOD I dont get to see you that much and you never hang out for very long PERIOD Naps take away from the time we spend together. and then I poked several giant holes in his logic by reminding him I would always make the halfhour drive to his house three to four days a week and spend  hours sitting around his house doing nothing but putting up with him trying at least to get his fingers inside me PERIOD

So we would attempt to nap PERIOD But as he had a twin bed space was limited so I would insist he be the big spoon and I be the little spoon PERIOD

No he would argue PERIOD If youre going to nap youre going to do it my way PERIOD I want you to face me so I can watch you fall asleep. to a woman whos claustrophobic thats quite a creepy demand PERIOD That napping situation was not going to happen PERIOD

And so we fought PERIOD Over what position to fall asleep in PERIOD For the love of God PERIOD

Then there was Collin the fellow hypersomniac who I thought I would get along great with as he had no problems with my consistent napping PERIOD

The difference between us was that even though I loved sleeping as often and for as long as I could I knew when it was time to get my ass out of bed and move on with my day PERIOD He didnt PERIOD

I need all  fingers and at least a couple of my toes to count how many times in a row I have gone to pick him up at his house to go on that super special breakfast or lunch date he promised hed treat me to only to find him laying in bed PERIOD Asleep PERIOD Snoring PERIOD Naked PERIOD

It was obvious he didnt care about his girlfriend enough to set his cell phone and alarm clock on time even though he proposed the date in the first place PERIOD I had better things to do than stare at his unconsciously erect penislike catching a few extra Zs in the comfort of my own bed PERIOD

And so we fought PERIOD Over something we had in common PERIOD For Chrissake PERIOD

Since these two failed relationships Ive cut back on the shared naps PERIOD Apparently they start losing their romantic appeal if done too often and understandably so PERIOD

Oh the countless warnings I would give to little 4yearold me not that shed believe me anyway
