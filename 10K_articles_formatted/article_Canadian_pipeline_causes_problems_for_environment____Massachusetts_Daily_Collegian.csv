The U.S PERIOD State Department released its 2000page draft environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline last Friday a project slated to transport oil from the tar sands of Alberta Canada to Steele City Neb. and then finally onto the Gulf of Mexico PERIOD

The tar sands in Alberta Canada are currently home to millions of barrels of oil PERIOD Because Alberta is landlocked most of this oil ends up transported to the American Midwest for processing PERIOD Unluckily for Canada Cushing Okla. is also home to an abundant source of oil that needs to be refined which means there is a surplus of Canadian crude that sells at a  discount PERIOD This bottleneck makes Canadian oil producers unhappy for fiscal reasons PERIOD The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of three proposed solutions to remedy the issue PERIOD

Keystone Pipeline in full is a strategy proposed by TransCanada Corp PERIOD to pipe oil from the tar sands in Hardisty Alberta through the United States down to the Gulf Coast PERIOD Because more than  percent of Gulf Coast output is dedicated to export Canada and its oil now have greater access to world markets PERIOD Keystone includes four phases the first two having already been completed PERIOD

Phase three and four are what is referred to as Keystone XL PERIOD Through the implementation of these new pipes Canada will benefit foreign importers of oil will benefit but the United States will be stuck in the middle housing just over  miles of underground pipes pumping even more of the worlds dirtiest oil through its heartland and left at risk for a potentially massive ecodisaster PERIOD

In opposition to these theories the State Departments draft concluded that Keystone XL would have a small impact on the climate even though the extraction shipping refining and burning of tar sand oil emits more greenhouse gases than more typical forms of foreign and domestic oil production PERIOD

Since climate change has in fact been materialized in part by human activity its critical that the country takes steps to slow down the process not contribute to a problem that we helped create PERIOD Combined with the current pipelines Keystone XL could more than triple U.S PERIOD consumption of tar sands oil one of the most polluting and carbonintensive fuels in the world according to the National Wildlife Federation PERIOD And coupled with pollution from the process of extracting this oil it will subsequently wreak havoc on earths climate PERIOD Or we could just ignore this altogether and support the ridiculous dichotomy of warning against the hazards of climate change yet allowing for a project that will only make them substantially worse PERIOD

Another incredibly important environmental concern is the danger of leaking or faulty pipes that could potentially cause a largescale ecological disaster PERIOD More likely than not the pipes will leak Keystone I reportedly suffered  in its first year alone though was predicted to leak only once every seven years PERIOD So if or when Keystone XL leaks crude oil will be released into the surrounding areas of grassland wetlands river systems or other open water sources and could potentially disrupt and reduce alreadysensitive wildlife populations and aquatic habitats PERIOD

But the jobs It seems like a small risk to take compared to all the jobs the pipeline will create right Sure if one is inferring temporary jobs PERIOD The purported thousands of jobs this pipeline will create are only temporary PERIOD Once manufacture of the 1661mile pipeline is complete it need only be maintained in the longterm by as few as  people according to the U.S PERIOD State Department or as many as a few hundred according to TransCanada PERIOD These inflated jobs numbers dont bode well for TransCanada nor for U.S PERIOD House Speaker John Boehner who has harped on job creation to rally support for the project and who coincidentally reportedly invested thousands of dollars into firms with stake in Canadian oil sand PERIOD

Keystone XL has long been fought against by climate activists and rightfully so PERIOD President Barack Obama already denied a permit once for the project PERIOD The final decision on XL isnt anticipated until at least June but it certainly puts pressure on the president to deliver his inaugural promise to respond to the threat of climate change despite those who deny the overwhelming scientific evidence PERIOD His willingness to stand with science will reveal what might be its greatest political asset that it cannot be undermined by institutions with special interests or big oil corporations with their eyes on the dollar PERIOD It is based on fact and the facts surrounding Keystone XL prove that it isnt worth the environmental contingencies PERIOD

One othe thing PERIOD  Isnt it odd that NOT building the pipeline will benefit Warren Buffets railroad when Buffet is a noted supporter of Barackus Rex

US or China									  									Mar   at  pm

The same State Department report that you cite reports that oil sands production without the keystone pipeline will only be . to . percent less than if the pipeline is built PERIOD There are other ways to get the oil out PERIOD The report looks at two transporting it by train to existing pipelines or directly to oil tankers PERIOD Both would cause more emissions than the oil pipeline itself PERIOD Indeed the report says explicitly that the project was unlikely to have a substantial impact on climate change PERIOD

The report found it very unlikely that the pipeline would affect water quality in any of the four aquifers through which it crossed PERIOD It also concluded that in the case of a largescale oil spill these impacts would typically be limited to within several hundred feet of the release source and would not affect groundwater. the report found that the pipeline would create over  jobs during the two year construction period and the project would net  million in use and sales taxes for traversed states PERIOD

The Keystone pipeline could replace  of oil imported from overseas which means a boon to national security PERIOD

Finally not building the pipeline would seriously piss off Canada one of our biggest trade partners closest allies and staunchest supporters PERIOD

Problems

First and foremost that oil is going to be extracted and sold and burned PERIOD Period. this is not an inevitability and this much is even acknowledged by the oil industry itself PERIOD Without the pipeline there simply wouldnt be the transportation capacity to get the tar sands bitumen to places where it would be refined PERIOD This in turn dampens the economic prospects for expanding extraction PERIOD After all the bitumen itself needs to be refined before it has real value to potential buyers PERIOD If theres no way to refine the bitumen then the whole operation doesnt make much sense PERIOD

httpwww.td.comdocumentPDFeconomicsspecialca1212pipeline.pdf

Now it could be used by US reducing our dependence on Middle East oil or it can be sold to the Chinese. selling it to the Chinese would require that the bitumen in the tar sands actually be refined which blocking the pipeline is supposed to help prevent PERIOD China would not necessarily be in the business of refining it themselves and in fact arent actually all that interested in the tar sands oil for their own domestic use PERIOD

So whats more important US jobs and reducing our implicit funding of terror groups  or the emotionallysatisfying worship of the White Coast Priesthood and the increasinglyfrail climate science
