In a game marked by the occasional wail of vuvuzelas the womens soccer team tied  with the visiting San Diego State Aztecs Saturday night in a match that extended through extra time PERIOD Despite the underwhelming score line Miami maintained useful control over much of the game PERIOD

Through the first  minutes the Canes were able to keep SDSUs prodding overhead balls at bay and continued to get convincing chances at net PERIOD With two shots hitting the crossbar in a  minute period Miami had offensive momentum into the end of the first half PERIOD Yet in a moment that momentum was dashed away in frustration when SDSU was awarded a penalty in the forty-third minute PERIOD In an attempt to collect a loose ball after a corner kick freshman goalkeeper Melissa Dagenais took out an opposing forward in the box to generate SDSUs lone goal in the form of a penalty kick PERIOD

Despite the frustrating circumstances Miami dug into a gritty competitive mindset that generated plenty of chances moving through the second half PERIOD Multiple longshots including a rocket over the bar by Kristina Fisher in the  were peppered onto goal as Miami settled into the second half PERIOD With the Hurricanes aggressive wing play they were able to fire off  shots  of which were on target throughout the match PERIOD

The right side featuring skilled seniors Kristina Fisher and Bayleigh Chaviers especially provided problems for the SDSU backline PERIOD A chemistry built over four years was evident on the pitch and was echoed by the players PERIOD

Bayleigh and I work so well together Fisher said PERIOD I think just being here together for four years and finally playing on the same side has been really fun and I cant wait to finish out the season with her. it was that exact side that ended up finally putting a chance away for the Hurricanes in the waning minutes of the second half  as Bayleigh Chaviers chipped the ball over a keeper off her line marking her first goal this season PERIOD

In the spring we worked on it a lot just cutting in and getting a shot off and it just went in today Chaviers said PERIOD

I was back post for her but I knew it was going in all along Fisher joked with her goal scoring teammate PERIOD

Progressing through the extra time and multiple cramped players later Miami still couldnt find the sought after back of the net PERIOD Every convincing opportunity was either snuffed out by SDSU ended in a near miss or fizzled out from exhaustion PERIOD The four shots and three corners in extra time still didnt leave Miami with its golden goal PERIOD Instead they were left with a result indicative of two equal teams something that wasnt reflected on the pitch PERIOD Despite the unwanted scoreline the players still said they feel good moving into the rest of the season PERIOD

Take it day by day and practice by practice Chaviers said PERIOD I feel like weve been doing really well together. miamis next match is against Stetson on Thursday at  p.m PERIOD at Cobb Stadium PERIOD

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD",Womenâ€™s soccer team opens season with tie against San Diego State - The Miami Hurricane,University of Miami
