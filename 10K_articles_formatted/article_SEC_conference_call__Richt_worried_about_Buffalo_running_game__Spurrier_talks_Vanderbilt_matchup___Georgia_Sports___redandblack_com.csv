Editors Note The Red  Black listened in on the Wednesday SEC conference call open to all members of the media PERIOD Here are our observations from that call PERIOD

Georgia opens its  football schedule on Saturday against a Buffalo team that went  in the  season PERIOD Regardless of last seasons record Georgia head coach Mark Richt sees them as an experienced team that could prove challenging PERIOD

Overall theyve got  starters coming back on their team Richt said PERIOD  Richt said PERIOD Im anxious to see what we look like. freshmen tailbacks will see time against Buffalo

This offseason has seen the second straight year of attrition at the running back position for the Bulldogs PERIOD

The dismissal of Isaiah Crowell from the team in June paved the way for the possibility of true freshmen tailbacks Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall to see early playing time PERIOD According to Mark Richt that possibility has become a certainty PERIOD

I think everyone just wants to see them run the ball between the hedges when it counts in a real ballgame he said Theres no doubt theyll get in the game PERIOD Were looking forward to seeing them in there. despite the guarantee of early playing time for the duo of highlytouted ball carriers Richt stiil has some concerns over their pass blocking ability PERIOD

I hope theyre able to do a good job in pass protection PERIOD Thats one thing that can keep a back from playing a lot Richt said PERIOD You want your play caller to feel comfortable calling anything with them PERIOD We definitely need to protect the quarterback in our system and the running backs have a lot of responsibility in that area. richt however understands there is a learning curve with running backs learning how to pass protect and has faith in the duos ability to run the ball successfully PERIOD

Those are the things that dont come natural for them PERIOD I say they learn it last said Richt PERIOD Its not that heard to learn what track to take on running play then let your instincts and your ability take over PERIOD It takes a little bit to not only know who to hit but how to pass protect PERIOD Thats what will be interesting to see. spurrier and the Gamecocks prepare for Vanderbilt

SEC play opens before most college football teams have even sniffed the field when Vanderbilt hosts South Carolina in Nashville on Thursday PERIOD

The game between South Carolina and Vanderbilt is one of only three matchups between interconference foes the other two being ACC games PERIOD

South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier isnt worried about dipping into the conference schedule this early PERIOD

I think you got to play whoever you play during the course of the year Spurrier said PERIOD We have four weeks now to prepare for the first game PERIOD In the old days you had three weeks then you go play. spurrier sees one positive of playing a conference rival this early in the season being that his team is as healthy as they will be all year PERIOD

I think your players are healthier and ready to go at the beginning of the season he said PERIOD So weve had plenty of time Vandys had plenty of time PERIOD Weve got a lot of experienced guys coming back from last years team so we should be ready to play. spurrier also noted that his playbook notoriously filled with trick plays is completely open and hes not worried about showing his hand too soon PERIOD

We throw everything we can every week to try and win the game he said PERIOD Fortunately youre ahead enough in some games that you dont have to use a trick play or a special play then you dont do that PERIOD We bring everything weve got to try and win the game. saturday marks the beginningthe  Bulldogs finally hit the field PERIOD
