The Aztecs played without their top scorer senior guard Mckynzie Fort who was benched as a precaution by head coach Stacie Terry PERIOD

Fort said she broke her thumb during SDSUs  win over the University of Arizona PERIOD

A trio of guards  senior Khalia Lark and freshmen Naje Murray and Tea Adams  stepped up for the Aztecs scoring   and  points respectively PERIOD

I think as a team we played really solid Lark said PERIOD We had  assists which is something coach highlighted in the locker room PERIOD We tried to get everyone open shots PERIOD We always joke that its called dessert  Coach says we dont want a lot of dessert but here and there its great. the first quarter was a tugofwar battle until the Aztecs began to pull away building a sevenpoint lead on  percent threepoint shooting PERIOD SDSU also forced five turnovers in the opening period PERIOD

SDSU outrebounded the Royals  to  had a better field goal and threepoint shooting percentage and had half as many turnovers as the Royals PERIOD

Without Fort Adams stepped up to lead the team to victory PERIOD Not only did she shoot  percent from the field she also tallied eight rebounds and  assists with only one turnover coming off the bench PERIOD

Adams said she understood that an injury to one of the starters is something this team is prepared for PERIOD

It was tough there was definitely a missing piece but we have to get better just in case something like that ever happens again if one of our main players gets hurt we have to work together Adams said PERIOD

Terry had high praise for her freshman PERIOD

Im very impressed but Im not surprised Terry said PERIOD Thats the big thing we recruited Tea to come and do this stuff PERIOD She took advantage of the opportunity she had today. the Aztecs scored more than  points for the first time this season surpassing their previous season high of  against Arizona PERIOD SDSU shot . percent from the field as well as holding the Royals to only . percent shooting PERIOD The high scoring offense is a positive sign in Adams eyes PERIOD

Thats really big for our team PERIOD It means that against better teams we can score a lot and share the ball and be successful against even better teams Adams said PERIOD

With the win the Aztecs move to  on the season PERIOD

Lark said this team is showing drastic improvement from last season both on and off the court PERIOD

Its a lot different off the court we get along great we are closer than weve ever been before PERIOD Weve had a lot more discussions Behind the scenes weve really grown as a team. coach Terry says that she is seeing a championshiplevel drive with this team PERIOD
