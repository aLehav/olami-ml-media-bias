The Student Success Center has a wide set of resources for students including the Writing Center peer tutoring and review sessions PERIOD In addition they offer holistic support for students via success coaches like ITS junior Faiza Zaman PERIOD She focuses on helping students develop skills to deal with timemanagement motivation and procrastination PERIOD

The transition to college can be really scary Zaman said PERIOD It is a whole new lifestyle PERIOD Everyone adjusts differently. transitioning brings new stressors from schoolwork social life and extracurricular activities PERIOD Here are Zamans tips for incoming students to manage this new environment PERIOD

CREATE AN ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEM

When students come in the first question I ask is if they have a planner Zaman said PERIOD Obviously everyone wants to stay organized in their own way but I really suggest getting a planner. zaman likes to use her physical planner but students have found success with a variety of tools PERIOD Some enjoy using todo lists which give students a sense of accomplishment when they can cross something off PERIOD Others she said like bullet journaling which is a freeform calendar todo list and diary all rolled in one PERIOD She says these are particularly useful if you are artsy or looking for something aesthetically pleasing but warns that it often takes more time to maintain PERIOD There are also online resources like Google Calendar Todoist and Asana PERIOD

Finding a system that works for you is a process PERIOD Ideally you want something with enough structure to hold you accountable for your academics and social engagements  which can be just as important when it comes to mental health  but will not take too much energy to maintain PERIOD As many continue to shelter at home now is the perfect time to try to discover where your healthy balance of planning and spontaneity structured and unstructured time lies PERIOD Already having these systems in place will make your transition much smoother PERIOD Instead of scrambling as you settle into college life you will be able to fold your new environment into preexisting organizational systems PERIOD

FOCUS ON A LONGTERM GOAL

As classes transitioned to online in response to coronavirus Zaman said the Student Success Center saw an increase in students finding it challenging to stay motivated PERIOD

Doing online classes puts more time management skills on you Zaman said PERIOD You have to be able to motivate yourself even more than physical classes inperson. her recommendation to them has been to focus on a longterm goal try to fit the present task into a larger picture PERIOD For most students she helped this was graduation PERIOD However you can still practice this visualization with goals this summer even before your academic courses begin PERIOD Do you want to develop a habit that fits into a larger health goal Is there something that you want to learn that will help you on a larger professional trajectory

Zaman said writing down your goal and putting it in a highfrequency location like near your bed in the bathroom or by your desk can help with the muchneeded motivation especially during difficult times PERIOD The idea here is that focusing on something bigpicture will direct your energy towards something greater than any individual action PERIOD

RECOGNIZE YOUR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

When students begin to struggle Zaman suggests trying to understand where the challenges stem from PERIOD Isolating challenges make them easier to address PERIOD

If you are noticing that youre struggling in one or two specific classes figure out what makes a difference compared to your other classes Zaman said PERIOD

Students can try to carry lessons from classes in which they are finding success to classes where they are struggling PERIOD Are you more focused in mornings or afternoons Do you study better in groups or individually What are some ways that help you retain information Perhaps from your experiences with schools before UTD you already know some things about your learning habits PERIOD Keep those in mind as you prepare for classes to begin PERIOD

Zaman said that the transition to college is challenging in unique ways to every student PERIOD Incoming students should prepare to give themselves time to adjust PERIOD But when struggles persist students should seek external support PERIOD Zaman said that struggling students who do not feel comfortable coming into the office can turn to family and friends for advice PERIOD But if that is not enough there are trained UTD professionals who want to help PERIOD

Us coaches were not scary We welcome anyone to come into our office and discuss what challenges theyre having PERIOD We want to provide the best help we can Zaman said PERIOD

Students interested in academic success coaching can make an appointment online and depending on a students needs meetings can happen regularly throughout the semester or just once PERIOD
