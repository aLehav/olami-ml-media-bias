Barbara Jordan Media Award winners are selected by the Governors Committee on People with Disabilities and committees across the state PERIOD Nominated content was produced by professionals and students PERIOD

Each year the Barbara Jordan Media Award committee honors media professionals and students who successfully depict persons with disabilities in an accurate and positive light through media and communication outlets PERIOD

Thirteen winners were announced as recipients of the award on May  including journalism senior Rebecca Sloane communication senior Sarah Hoenig and Megan Rodriguez Class of  PERIOD The honorees were presented their awards through a virtual video that included each recipients acceptance speech and later will be sent a bronze medallion to commemorate their accomplishment PERIOD

Sloane whose contribution video to The Battalion titled Year Two Signing the Midnight Yell received the award in the College Broadcast category said she was encouraged to send in her nomination by her Journalism  professor Angelique Gammon PERIOD

Everyone was spitting out ideas for her project but I didnt really have anything to come out with Sloane said PERIOD And then I threw out there the one thing that I see that I do differently than everyone else is that Im also pursuing my Associates in American Sign Language at Blinn and really theres not that much involvement with them on campus PERIOD All she said to me was That PERIOD Thats what youre doing. according to gov.texas.gov in order to qualify for the award the judges require participants to present the individuals first with their disability as the latter subject PERIOD Sloane said this was the hardest box to check off when it came to meeting the committees requirements PERIOD

The biggest difficulty was the people that are deaf or hard of hearing do not like to be called disabled Sloane said PERIOD They do not like that term PERIOD They do not claim that they are disabled PERIOD While I was making the video my professor had brought up that I didnt mention that term and that was the entire purpose behind the award PERIOD That was the biggest goal like how do I accomplish this without demeaning anybody PERIOD And that I hope is what I accomplished. after receiving an email confirmation that she had won the award Sloane said she got emotional and even reached out to those involved with the project to share the good news PERIOD

My biggest goal in this has been to show these people are here and this is really the only resource they have Sloane said PERIOD Even as I was interviewing people for the video they were bringing up things like they wanted more recognition or more help if possible PERIOD Without them this wouldnt have even been possible PERIOD I was just the middleman. hoenigs nomination Beep Baseball Making Dreams Come True won in the College Print Magazine category which Hoenig said came as a complete shock when the email appeared in her inbox PERIOD

It was probably around the end of March and I was working on an assignment for class when I got the email Hoenig said PERIOD It wasnt necessarily on my mind just because there were so many other things going on it was just in the back of my head PERIOD When I saw it I was just so shocked and excited PERIOD I shared it with some of my peers who took the journalism class with me and they celebrated with me. hoenig said the idea to cover beep baseball came from an event she got to attend through her sorority Delta Gamma where she immediately knew she wanted to highlight those that are visually impaired PERIOD

I got to play beep baseball with about  other women or so and after that day and getting to interact with the coach I thought Wow there is a story in this and I knew I wanted to do it Hoenig said PERIOD

Ultimately Hoenigs main goal was to spread awareness that no matter the challenge being faced people with disabilities or impairments are to not be underestimated PERIOD

The overall goal was to display the reality and the challenges they face but to also show how strong and resilient people who are visually impaired are Hoenig said PERIOD I wanted to foster more inclusion for that community and show that they are so capable of doing so many things PERIOD It might look a little different but they are incredibly capable. rodriguez a former editorinchief of The Battalion and a current reporter at The BryanCollege Station Eagle won in the Print Profile category for her story Bridget Frank Facing challenges pursuing her passion PERIOD
