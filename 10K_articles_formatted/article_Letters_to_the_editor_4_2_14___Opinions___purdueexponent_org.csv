Racially charged remarks exist on both sides

I would like to respond to Bekah Ticens opinion piece accusing Congressman Paul Ryan of being a racist PERIOD Well it appears that First Lady Michelle Obama is in agreement with the cultural problem Congressman Ryan was discussing PERIOD

When it comes to getting an education too many of our young people just cant be bothered PERIOD Today instead of walking miles every day to school theyre sitting on couches for hours playing video games watching TV PERIOD Instead of dreaming of being a teacher or a lawyer or a business leader theyre fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper. this quote was from Michelle Obamas commencement speech at Bowie State University a historically black university in May of  PERIOD Do these not sound like racially charged remarks Where was the uproar Where was Al Sharpton denouncing these words This is just another classic example of the lefts double standard PERIOD Being a racist isnt based on your thoughts words or actions its based on your party affiliation PERIOD My suggestion to Miss Ticen is to engage in some rational thinking before making blatantly biased accusations PERIOD

Cutting common read beneficial for University

I recently read an article in The Exponent that said that the common core reading program had been eliminated in December PERIOD I was unaware of this like some of the faculty mentioned but I think that this is beneficial for Purdue PERIOD As a senior about to graduate I can honestly say that I have never needed the information from the common core PERIOD If its not being used in classrooms what is the point of having it

Some say that it makes transitioning to college easier but I would argue the opposite PERIOD Incoming freshmen already have an extensive todo list and reading an unnecessary book just gives them less time for useful preparation PERIOD Programs like Boiler Gold Rush are much more effective at preparing freshmen for their time at college PERIOD

All in all Im glad the program was eliminated PERIOD The  spent annually on this program could be better allocated PERIOD Kudos to President Daniels for his decision PERIOD Hopefully the University Senate will uphold it PERIOD

Best Buddies program works for inclusion of special needs

As a concerned group of students at Purdue in the College of Education we are taking it upon ourselves to get the word out about the concern that special needs students should be more readily able to be integrated within regular extracurricular activities and sports throughout their academic careers PERIOD Throughout schools and universities across America there are students with special needs and disabilities who often do not receive the same opportunities as their peers without special needs PERIOD There are plenty of opportunities right here on campus to help make a difference in this respect and we feel they are not being taken advantage of as much as they should be PERIOD One of the biggest organizations out there is called Best Buddies PERIOD

This organization pairs special needs students with nonspecial needs peers to encourage friendships through various activities PERIOD Organizations like Best Buddies can break down divides between groups of students promote friendship and cooperation and give students a fuller social experience PERIOD Students can learn to look past their outside differences and make lifelong friends PERIOD If programs like this one gained more attention awareness to the inclusion or lack of inclusion that plagues the special needs community today would increase and maybe this concern could be eradicated PERIOD Inclusion of special needs students is a widespread and complex issue but Purdue students can make an impact by getting involved and being agents of change PERIOD

Color schemes not representative of Purdue community

I like everyone else received the email from Mitch Daniels about the Purdue Student Government elections PERIOD So I checked out the websites for both sets of Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates PERIOD

I found it ironic that both websites had not only a red white and blue color scheme but also the candidates wore red white and blue PERIOD They chose colors that represent America instead of colors like black and gold that represent Purdue and these are the people trying to become the representatives of Purdue PERIOD

These elections are at Purdue which yes happens to be in America and have many Americans PERIOD However Purdue has students from many diverse backgrounds PERIOD In fact according to Purdues Fall  International Student and Scholar Enrollment  Statistical Report international students make up . percent of the undergraduate student body totaling to  students PERIOD

I had hoped that at least one set of candidates would have worked to be inclusive of all Purdue students when choosing something as simple as a color scheme of a website PERIOD
