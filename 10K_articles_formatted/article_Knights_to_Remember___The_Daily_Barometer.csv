Noah Evans Sports ContributorJune  

As summer arrives and Beaver Nation disperses a peculiar tranquility settles over our campus PERIOD

All of a sudden it becomes easy to find an elliptical machine at Dixon there are no more casual spike ball games being played on the Intramural fields and you can hear a pin drop while strolling down Monroe PERIOD

Amidst the melodic chirping of birds the only sound that seems to interrupt the summer serenity is the crack of a wooden bat colliding with a thrown baseball  and that can only mean one thing the Corvallis Knights are back at Goss Stadium PERIOD

The Knights are a summer college baseball team  not only do we always have Beavers play for us but we also feature college players from the entire northwest said Bre Miller the teams president and Oregon State University alumnus PERIOD

The Knights who play in the West Coast League have had several OSU players take the field for them according to the Knights website PERIOD Former Beavers that have donned the Knights uniform include Nick Madrigal 2B  Adley Rutschman C  and Steven Kwan OF  PERIOD Current Beavers Travis Bazzana 2B  Ryan Brown RHP  and Tanner Smith C  have also spent their summers in Corvallis PERIOD

The Knights love to have fun and it just so happens they love to win while doing it PERIOD They lead the WCL in total wins  and since relocating to Corvallis from Gresham in  they have won nine league titles adding six in the last six seasons PERIOD

For players the Knights serve as an opportunity to finetune their game in the offseason PERIOD While it may be serious for the athletes fans are urged to sit back kick their feet up and enjoy a sunny day in Corvallis PERIOD

We really want there to be a reason to care to come to a Knights game besides the baseball said Miller PERIOD Really making everybody feel included like they are part of the show. miller added that every Friday or Saturday game last season had either a giveaway for fans or a fireworks display something the Knights intend to continue this year PERIOD

From themed nights like Big League Chew Night to special events like Strike Out Cancer Night featuring unique jerseys and fundraising for charities the Knights put on a show thats fun for all ages PERIOD Their promotional schedule also includes giveaways of mini bats hats Tshirts and more according to the team website PERIOD

In order to serve the college students that call Corvallis home over the summer the Knights feature adult beverage promotions including Two Towns Tuesdays Wine Wednesdays and Thirsty Thursdays feature fourdollar pours from local vendors that Corvallis residents know and love PERIOD

Recognizing the importance of reciprocation the Knights consider giving back to their supportive community an integral part of their mission PERIOD

Not only are we a summer entertainment option but we are also a pillar of the community said Miller PERIOD We give back in donation packages to a lot of nonprofits for auctions and giveaways we support youth sports and we sponsor the games room at the Boys and Girls Club in Corvallis  we really just try to be ingrained in the community and be a part of Corvallis. the Knights will play their first home game on June  at  p.m PERIOD The homeopeners giveaway is a magnet schedule and will also be the first Thirsty Thursday of the season meaning specialty beer pours are just four dollars PERIOD
