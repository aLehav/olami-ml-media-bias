Graduate Student Kiana Scott was selected as the  student regent on the UW Board of Regents PERIOD

Gov PERIOD Jay Inslee has selected graduate student Kiana Scott as the  student regent on the UW Board of Regents effective July  PERIOD

Scott who will replace previous student regent Christopher Jordan is only the second doctoral candidate to be selected as the student regent since  PERIOD She holds a masters degree in public administration from the Evans School of Public Affairs and is currently pursuing a doctorate degree in political communication PERIOD She also works as a graduate teaching assistant in the communications department PERIOD

As the new student regent Scott plans to improve communication between students from all three UW campuses and the administration PERIOD She aims to be accessible to students serving as an effective channel through whom students can communicate their concerns to administrators PERIOD She added it will be an interesting situation this year after the state passed a budget June  that would keep undergraduate instate tuition rates from increasing PERIOD

Thats a great start but theres a lot more to do to make sure that education is affordable and accessible to students Scott said PERIOD

Scotts experience is unique according to Adam Sherman the  president of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate GPSS who cochaired the student regent selection committee alongside outgoing ASUW President Evan Smith PERIOD

Sherman said Scott has an understanding of graduate students from her experience in pursuing her masters degree as well as an undergraduate student point of view from her position as a teaching assistant PERIOD Due to her experience pursuing her doctoral degree she also understands the research mission of the UW as a major public research institution Sherman said PERIOD

Those are characteristics that are rare to find he said PERIOD Im really excited to see somebody who understands those issues not just conceptually but also pragmatically through experience. scott was selected as a finalist for the position by a studentregent selection committee made up of student representatives from various entities across the UW campuses such as the GPSS the ASUW Board of Directors the Residence Hall Student Association and the ASUW Student Senate PERIOD The selected finalists were forwarded for consideration to Inslees office where the final decision was made PERIOD

UW students who serve as board members provide the Board of Regents with important information and perspective  board chair Joanne Harrell said in a statement PERIOD We know that Kiana will help in our deliberations in the coming year. jordan said the student regent holds equal voting power on the board and votes on all issues except for matters involving the hiring discipline and tenure of faculty members and personnel PERIOD He added that it can be intimidating to be the only student member of a group of community leaders and being the only voice for student perspectives PERIOD

Its kind of a daunting task Jordan said PERIOD Ive worked with Kiana and I know that she already has the personality to ask the right questions to be willing to listen to really work hard to be present for students and to know background policy issues. unlike the other regents who hold sixyear terms the student regent only serves a oneyear term PERIOD Even though student regents have shorter terms Scott said they face the same policy issues that other regents face which typically take longer than one year to address PERIOD She hopes to work closely with Jordan to maintain programs that he pursued during his term PERIOD

The oneyear term means that I need to be ready to hit the ground running Scott said PERIOD Theres a lot to accomplish and of course it cant all be done in a year  but making sure that we continue to make progress and to push forward to grow and to

reach toward our goals will be a great accomplishment. reach Science Editor Imana Gunawan at newsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter imanafg
