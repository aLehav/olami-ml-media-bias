The Federal Food and Drug Administrations lack of response to the vast protesting of the ineligibility of men who have had sex with other men to donate blood is unacceptable PERIOD Because of this policy hundreds of student donors are not only ineligible but have no desire to give PERIOD Students need to show the FDA their disapproval of their outdated policy PERIOD

The statistics on HIVAIDS are dynamic and have been arbitrarily applied to gay men based on outdated assumptions PERIOD

The large numbers of seemingly healthy men who came down with symptoms of HIVAIDS in  lead medical experts and the public to coin the sickness as the  A subsequent donor policy was implemented to ban men who have had sexual contact with other men since  when experts believed widespread outbreaks of the virus began in the United States PERIOD

But these presumptions from almost  years ago do not hold up with todays data PERIOD

Advert an international AIDS charity organization provides statistics showing that all groups of ethnicities sexes and sexualities are affected by the HIVAIDS pandemic in the United States PERIOD And in  most people infected with the virus are African American heterosexual men PERIOD

Although maletomale contact constitutes the highest risk for route of infection heterosexual activity and drug injection use are just as likely possibilities PERIOD

Its clear that because the virus infects anyone regaurgless of race sex or sexual orientation and the routes for infection are numerous no one group carries the burden of carrying and spreading HIV PERIOD

There is absolutely no viability or sensibility in this policy PERIOD It was a rational course of action after the first break out of HIVAIDS in the early 1980s but more research has shown that its current existence is outdated and unneccesary PERIOD

More disheartening is that this outdated and sexually prejudice attitude hurts the people in need of blood more than anyone PERIOD

On February  the Kansan reported that the Red Cross has pledged full support for lobbying for the repeal of this policy PERIOD Not donating blood is not the way to amend the problem PERIOD Students who are eligible to donate blood should still do so PERIOD The Red Cross is not to blame for the policy implemented by the FDA PERIOD

Students should still support the Red Cross and donate blood and they need to aim their disapporival at the FDA
