Just in case you didnt notice the womens basketball team played further into March and April last year than the mens team did PERIOD

Senior Danielle McCray averaged nearly  points and eight rebounds per game in the Jayhawks surprising WNIT run PERIOD They lost a heartbreaker to South Florida in the championship game but the sentiment from all the players after the loss was the same PERIOD

Senior LaChelda Jacobs said it the most succinctly 

When Jacobs uses the word  its clear shes referring to the Big Dance PERIOD Making the WNIT was nice and all but its not like Dancing PERIOD Unless Lady Luck throws a few injuries into the mix the Jayhawks will make the tournament PERIOD

And I think theyll win the Big  Championship too PERIOD

Its not ludicrous PERIOD The coaches tabbed Kansas to finish tied for second in the preseason poll PERIOD They received three firstplace votes PERIOD

Baylor No PERIOD  in the poll has otherworldly freshman center Brittney Griner and poses the biggest challenge PERIOD In her senior year of high school Griner put up numbers that would make LeBron James blush  points . rebounds . blocks  . steals and . assists per game PERIOD

But maybe the most jawdropping stat Griners . dunks per game PERIOD

Griner can throw down and throw down hard PERIOD There wont be too many defenses in the Big  that can contain a 6foot8 center who can dunk PERIOD Check that  there wont be any PERIOD

Ill channel my inner Kenny Mayne to describe Griner 

So it wont be easy PERIOD But all the pieces are there PERIOD McCray is an extremely talented scorer who will put the team on her back in the closing moments of a game PERIOD

Senior Sade Morris is a willing sidekick who quietly puts up  points a night PERIOD Junior Nicollete Smith provides an outside look and junior Krysten Boogaard and sophomore Aishah Sutherland can convert around the bucket PERIOD

But the key for this years team is the development of the point guard position PERIOD Ivana Catic was steady last year but not threatening PERIOD She graduated and two players are competing for the spot freshman Angel Goodrich and junior college transfer Rhea Codio PERIOD

Whether one wins the job or they split time is irrelevant because they are both playmakers PERIOD As they mature in the position this team will only get better PERIOD

With a Big  Northheavy schedule the Jayhawks will be right there with Baylor PERIOD The Bears and Jayhawks face off Feb PERIOD  in Waco Texas on ESPN2 PERIOD

Its early but the Jayhawks will win that one and take home their first conference championship in womens basketball since  PERIOD
