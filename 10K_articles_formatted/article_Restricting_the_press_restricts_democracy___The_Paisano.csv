The Texas Legislature which commenced its biannual session earlier this month announced that it would continue a measure from the COVID19 pandemic that protected members of the legislature PERIOD The measure was originally enacted in  and barred reporters from attending sessions on the legislatures floor according to the Texas Tribune PERIOD Originally reported in a tweet by investigative reporter Lauren McGaughy from the Dallas Morning News McGaughy released a statement she had received from Secretary of the Senate Patsy Spaw PERIOD

There are no changes from last session Spaw wrote PERIOD There is no floor seating for the press. the statement then continues to outline the restrictions placed on the press that were levied during the  legislative session which designates them to sit in the gallery on the third floor while legislators conduct their business on the second floor PERIOD

While this measure was largely understandable during the  legislative session due to the extraneous circumstances of the COVID19 pandemic this development has come under harsh criticism for remaining in place during the current session PERIOD The motives of this move have come into question as well with the notion that Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick  who is also the President of the Texas Legislature  has come out publicly against other forms of COVID19 prevention measures such as vaccination requirements PERIOD In a tweet from  Patrick famously stated that taking the COVID vax is a personal decision and should never be forced upon by the state or a private employer. why is the legislature taking measures to ensure their personal safety from reporters while not promoting safety in other public settings

These measures could very well represent the start of a movement within the legislature to limit the reach and coverage of the press PERIOD While the relationship between the press and the legislature is strenuous in nature citizens everywhere rely on the press to report on the dealings of our representatives PERIOD They should not be restricted from conveying that information to the public PERIOD Our government should not operate behind closed doors without oversight from the citizens it represents PERIOD

As citizens we cannot idly stand by while our legislature places needless limitations on the press and must demand their discontinuation PERIOD You can find the contact information for your local representatives office at httpshouse.texas.govmembers and httpssenate.texas.govmembers.php PERIOD
