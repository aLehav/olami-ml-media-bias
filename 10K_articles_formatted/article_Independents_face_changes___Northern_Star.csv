By  Joe BushSeptember  

The Leftover League The Casserole Conference How about the Oddball Association

By the end of the decade or sooner if Division I football independents arent invited to join either an existing conference or a newlyformed mutant group they could form one of their own say independent athletic directors PERIOD

Of this years  independents one Penn State has accepted the Big Tens engagement ring and for six Eastern schools Boston College Pitt Syracuse Temple Rutgers and West Virginia the question is not if but when PERIOD

Miami and Florida State are prize Atlantic catches for some coastal alliance PERIOD Notre Dame with its rebellious TV package can stay independent but Theyre in another world Louisiana Tech AD Paul Miller says PERIOD

In the next few years the remaining  misfits NIU included will most likely align with a league probably their own PERIOD Being swallowed by any of the proposed gigantic elite conferences for schools like Tulane and Virginia Tech could literally be a nowin situation PERIOD

If coaches have a say theyre not gonna be too happy with a superconference because  percent of them are going to lose most of their games says University of Akron AD Jim Dennison PERIOD

I think our greatest opportunity is going to be part of a new conference says NIU Athletic Director Gerald ODell PERIOD I know were not ready to step up to the Big Ten or the Big Eight PERIOD I do think we offer the TV market but we dont offer the facilities. oDell says in order to fulfill NIUs goal of Division IA conference affiliation the school needs to improve its athletic facilities strengthen its football schedule and increase outside funding PERIOD

For example ODell says the independents with whom NIU would be most conferencecompatibleLouisville Akron Louisiana Tech Southwestern Louisiana Cincinnati Tulsa and Southern Mississippieither have large stadiums or are planning to expand PERIOD

People dont want to come play at a secondrate facility PERIOD Secondly its hard to recruit to a facility thats not top quality says ODell PERIOD

To those who thought 25yearold Huskie Stadium was the Taj Mahal of multiuse athletic structures ODell says theres not enough room for the number of athletes and coaches football field hockey soccer womens gymnastics who call the stadium home PERIOD

We have approximately  football players and we have a training room which might accomodate soccer field hockey and softball PERIOD Thats about it says ODell PERIOD

Only the football team has its own locker room PERIOD The womens gymnastics team changes in a handicapped restroom PERIOD

Its really a Division II facility and thats what it was built for PERIOD It was built to accomodate a college division as it was called then or a Division II athletic program ODell says PERIOD

NIUs football schedule tentative through  reflects the schools wish to build a reputation PERIOD Driven by one part ambition one part NCAA legislation NIU has scheduled fewer Division IAA squads just one in  and  PERIOD The NCAA announced recently that beginning in  a team must have beaten at least six Division I teams to be bowlworthy PERIOD

Future opponents include Illinois Arkansas Army Iowa Florida Indiana and Wisconsin PERIOD

Scheduling is very much on athletic directors minds when the subject of conference realignment is brought up PERIOD The bigger the leagues the fewer open dates the newly aligned teams will offer PERIOD Even now says Louisiana Techs Miller Scheduling as an independent is horrendous. akrons Dennison says what scares me more than anything is the prospect of firmly scheduled independents joining a league before the end of the teams scheduling contract PERIOD Usually such problems are settled by what ODell calls gentlemens agreements but schools can and have broken contracts resulting in losses of money and additions of hassle PERIOD Legal action is usually only brought on by shortnotice pullouts PERIOD

If a team chooses not to buy out of a contract and simply pull out it can be sued PERIOD Dennison says such cases havent held up well in courts. nIU Legal Counsel George Shur says the contracts are legally binding the problem with them depends on the schools involved PERIOD If two state schools are involved in a suit the court of jurisdiction is the United States Supreme Court PERIOD Shur says no one wants to go that far PERIOD Outofcourt settlements are the result PERIOD

Whatever configuration comes out of all this conference affiliation talk theres gonna be changes made says ODell PERIOD These things schedule changes go back and forth its part of the games you play PERIOD I dont think anythings ever written in stone even these contracts. oDell says deals have been made between NIU and others in the past few years PERIOD ODell felt NIU was in over its head in  and pulled NIU out of a game at some cost with national power Florida State PERIOD

ODell also points out that as independents disappear teams like Central Florida Georgia Southern and Arkansas State will soon be granted Division I status PERIOD

As usual the whims of the greedy will shake up the comfort of the content PERIOD Athletic directors feelings range from the fear of the unknownIt could get to be an emergency overnight says Dennisonto ODells calmness borne of conviction PERIOD By  ODell says NIUs schedule and facilities should be ready for the big time PERIOD

I dont think we should be in a panic situation says ODell PERIOD We have to worry about what we have to do to be in position when the opportunity comes for a IA conference affiliation PERIOD You need to be attractive when the date is offered. advertisement
