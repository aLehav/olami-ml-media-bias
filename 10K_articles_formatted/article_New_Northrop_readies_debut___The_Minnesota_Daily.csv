In addition to performances and lectures including one from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on April  the new Northrop will be home to three University academic programs the Institute for Advanced Study the University Honors Program and the College of Designs Travelers Innovation Lab PERIOD

We thought carefully about how to reconfigure the space so that we can get the most out of it  not just as a performance facility and a cultural heart to our campus but also as an academic contributor said Pam Wheelock vice president for University Services PERIOD

The 2700seat threebalcony main auditorium is down from its former 4847seat capacity PERIOD
