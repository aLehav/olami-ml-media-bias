Scientists at UTSA have recently uncovered a new relationship between the psychostimulant cocaine and dopamine responses in the brain PERIOD

This new information which was published in the most recent issue of the Journal of Neuroscience sheds light into how the brain reacts when there is added efforts into receiving a drug reward PERIOD

Matt Wanat an assistant professor of neuroscience at UTSA who published the article believes that learning how the brain reacts to food rewards versus drug rewards is an important step in understanding drug addiction PERIOD Wanat studies the neurobiology of motivated behaviors specifically dopamine responses in the brain PERIOD

The brain is a cluster of cells Wanat said PERIOD

Dopamine starts with the brain PERIOD These cells are constantly working and communicating with one another PERIOD The way they communicate is through chemicals called neurotransmitters PERIOD

Neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin dopamine and endorphin that can be released by the brain and act on other cells PERIOD These releases create a ripple effect throughout the brain which can stimulate actions or inhibit responses to certain outside stimuli PERIOD

I hate to say that dopamine just does one thing Wanat said PERIOD Its not like dopamine equals the pleasure center PERIOD Its involved with a large number of things PERIOD Its important for natural learning movement its important in motivation PERIOD Its a modulator. dopamine responses in the brain are altered with drug addiction PERIOD Professor Wanat and head researcher Idaira Olivas experiment measured dopamine responses in rats that were trained to work for a drug reward PERIOD The experiment used voltammetry to measure chemical responses in the brain PERIOD

If we give a food pellet to an animal we can see there is a nice rise of dopamine to that food pellet PERIOD If the animal likens a cocaine infusion we can see there is a nice rise of dopamine to that Wanat said PERIOD

The animals used a basic task  a lever press  to retrieve the reward PERIOD

To look at how much effort an animal is willing to do what you can do is have an animal press once to get a food pellet well the next time youre going to have to press two times the next time after that youre going to have to press five times then youre going to have to press ten times and then youre going to have to press forty times Wanat said PERIOD And you keep going up and up and up to a point where the animal says F it PERIOD Im done and thats a very powerful way to get a measure of motivation PERIOD You can see how the dopamine signals change to these rewards as you change the cost. the results showed that there was a disconnect between the dopamine response in the brain when given drug rewards versus food rewards PERIOD In other words a larger dopamine response was given when working for a food reward than working for a drug reward PERIOD

These results give insight into how dopamine works in the body PERIOD Dopamine research is important for learning more about drug addiction and processes that might aid in research for illnesses associated with dopamine such as Parkinsons disease PERIOD

Parkinsons disease affects dopamine production PERIOD People who suffer from Parkinsons have  to  percent decrease in the amount of dopamine in their body which inhibits their movement PERIOD This research could lead to a better understanding of dopamine that could one day lead to a cure or a better treatment for symptoms of Parkinsons PERIOD

People who suffer from drug addiction have to overcome greater costs to obtain drugs PERIOD

Drug addiction is a brain disease PERIOD Its not just one part of the brain thats misfiring or not acting appropriately PERIOD That part of the brain talks to another part that talks to another part that elicits change all throughout Wanat said PERIOD

Understanding how the brain reacts to drugs when compared to food gives researchers a glimpse into how the brain functions when working for rewards PERIOD Currently there is no FDA approved treatment for psychostimulant addiction PERIOD Wanat hopes that his research will help scientists uncover more about addiction and treatments PERIOD
