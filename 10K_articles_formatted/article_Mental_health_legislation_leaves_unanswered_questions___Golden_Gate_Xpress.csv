1464,2023-11-04,"when the California State University Board of Trustees adopted legislation at its Jan PERIOD  meeting to increase funding for mental health services it granted what many students and faculty had been asking for years  a way to increase the number of counselors and expand resources throughout CSU PERIOD

The  legislative proposal will establish the College Mental Health Services Program appropriating money from the Proposition  fund to expand services at California community colleges the University of California and the CSU system PERIOD Still several details remain unclear including the amount of money and a timeline of distribution PERIOD

Proposition  which was passed in  used funds resulting from a state personal income tax surcharge of  on incomes over  million to expand mental health programs PERIOD The exact increase in funding is yet to be determined and it is unknown as to when the information will be known according to Hazel Kelly public affairs manager for the CSU in an email to Xpress PERIOD





The general demand is that we make decisions about the budget together said Teresa Pratt assistant professor at SF State and adviser at Students for Quality Education PERIOD So faculty and students would have shared governance and staff would make decisions together about how we should use the money we have. the pandemic has exacerbated mental health issues in all especially college students PERIOD The legislation while promoted as beneficial doesnt directly address when aid is expected to be coming to SF State and other CSU campuses PERIOD

Pratt said that the SF State is often not very forthcoming with information pertaining to the budget even though faculty are supposed to have access to knowledge concerning most budget decisions PERIOD On this issue and many other issues we are always asking the administration for more transparent information and not getting what we want she said PERIOD

Currently at SF State there are  counselors available for SF State students creating a 1to2000 ratio for the student body PERIOD

The International Association of Counseling Services recommends a ratio of  students per counselor PERIOD Data from a  California Faculty Association report found only five schools met that ratio PERIOD The CSU system average is at  PERIOD

The report also listed the benefits of student counseling to be lower attrition improved academic performance and reduced legal liability for campuses PERIOD

Over the last year the economic social and emotional impacts of COVID19 have caused the overall mental health of college students to plummet PERIOD Leslie Jaeyoun Shin clinical counselor and outreach coordinator at SF State wrote in an email to Xpress we have seen a notable increase in students seeking services for COVID19 specific concerns including health issues grief and loss adjustment difficulties physical and mental wellness and heightened anxiety. nia Hall SF State student and intern for SQE which works in conjunction with the California Faculty Association tested positive for COVID19 while staying in the resident halls on campus PERIOD She said the isolation she experienced affected her mental health greatly PERIOD

Had I not been in the meetings that I was in with CFA Cops Off Campus with my comrades in SQE or at work online I think I would have literally not been able to handle it Hall said PERIOD

If youre a counselor you have way more work than you should PERIOD The demand would be seven more counselors at least and that they be Black Brown just representative of the student body PERIOD

 Teresa Pratt

However when it comes to the new mental health services program expanding these services Shin wrote The additional funding is still in its early stages so the impact it will have across each CSU is not known yet. according to the April  Academic Senate Resolution calling for increased resources for CAPS At times each semester when demand greatly exceeds the number of appointment slots available unless students report that they are in crisis or seeking a brief consultation they may need to wait  weeks for an appointment. thats a labor issue for faculty too Pratt said PERIOD If youre a counselor you have way more work than you should PERIOD The demand would be seven more counselors at least and that they be Black Brown just representative of the student body. for Pratt and Hall this additional money from the Prop PERIOD  fund is not enough PERIOD Both are also involved with the Cops Off Campus Committee which aims to dismantle and defund university police reallocating those funds to go toward welltrained mental health crisis intervention teams that are unaffiliated with policing and improving existing resources for students such as the Black Unity Center and hiring more fulltime staff for those centers PERIOD

What if we replaced UPD staff with Black Unity Center staff who are doing all of these affirmative supports specifically for Black students You know that to me is like a clear easy easy thing Pratt said PERIOD
