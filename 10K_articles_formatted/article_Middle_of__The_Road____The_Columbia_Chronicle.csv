The world has gone gray PERIOD The apocalypse came and snuffed out all life from moss and lichen on up the food chain PERIOD Its been months since youve seen another human being and that thought fills you with dread PERIOD After all your flesh is some of the last remaining digestible material on the planet PERIOD Suicide becomes more alluring as the threat of cannibalismor

starvationlooms PERIOD

Such is life in director John Hillcoats The Road adapted from the acclaimed Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name PERIOD But Hillcoats rendering shifts the focus from dystopia to melodrama for reasons unclear PERIOD

The score by fellow Australian and longtime collaborator Nick Cave is misused and distracting PERIOD Dull lilting piano refrains conjure the image of a bored child stuck indoors while it rains PERIOD For one threeminute period

Cave begrudgingly allows us a grungy industrial rock song PERIOD Its about the only time music completely clicked PERIOD Though heavy handed the score never becomes sarcasticthats not a compliment PERIOD

Characters with names like Man and Boy form obvious symbolic archetypes as the film follows the mode of literature PERIOD But this contrasts again with the depth of specificity surrounding the acting and emotions that become central to the viewing experience PERIOD Viggo Mortensen plays the Man who has reserved his own existence to protecting and preparing his Boy PERIOD His emotional range is impressive as he confronts the many and varied obstacles before him PERIOD His face serves as a counterpoint to the barren landscape PERIOD But how seriously can we take his pain when he is little more than a symbolic man He represents the old order unable to succeed in the new world though tasked with bringing up the next generation PERIOD His late wife represents human pain and loss wrapped in harsh practicality that cannot rationally justify this new tortured existence PERIOD And Boy who carries the fire inside is of course a new hope PERIOD Born into dystopia he is tasked with finding a way out for humanity. they walk the titular metaphorical road southto salvation

or judgment PERIOD

These themes and many others might have been best left for the novel PERIOD When the travelers meet an old man or a thief the audience is interested in the literal interaction more than the figurative PERIOD There is enough meat in terms of power fear and social order not to have to resort to symbolism PERIOD Symbolism has its place but The Road just isnt The Seventh Seal PERIOD There are many reasons why it doesnt work which have more to do with the audience than the production PERIOD

Expectations for this film fall in line with its predecessors like  Days Later to Children of Men PERIOD But is Hillcoat at fault for doing something slightly different Yes when it makes for a less enjoyable film PERIOD A postapocalyptic film should be a visceral experience PERIOD It should draw the audience in early and expose the exquisite decay of the new world PERIOD It becomes an emotional experience for the viewer as much as the characters PERIOD Whatever meaning we take from it is tied back to our nonapocalyptic lives in retrospect PERIOD This is the FDR model for bottomup dystopia PERIOD Hillcoat dubiously subscribes to Reagans topdown approach beginning with the meaning and ending potentially with something cinematic PERIOD

The narrative structure further hinders accessibility PERIOD The first  minutes are like a game of temporal pingpong PERIOD At one level this allows us to see the juxtaposition of life before and after and robs us of any comfort going in PERIOD It also confuses and distances the audience from the onset PERIOD Its as if Hillcoat knows what people want and tries to keep viewers from falling into the world and becoming cemented in the experience PERIOD

The hypothetical apocalypse described is still compelling PERIOD The Road is a fresh though not definitive take on the genre PERIOD
