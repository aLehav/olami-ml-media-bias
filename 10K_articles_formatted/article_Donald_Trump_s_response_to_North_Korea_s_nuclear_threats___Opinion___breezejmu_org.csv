Donald Trump speaks on October   in Washington D.C PERIOD Trump has discussed North Korea and their increased nuclear threats over the past few weeks PERIOD Olivier DoulieryAbaca PressTNS

As of late a wide range of American citizens have been imbued with feelings of panic as the media endlessly erupts with tabloids and live coverage of the precarious backandforth threats between President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun chairman of the Workers Party of Korea PERIOD During late July a myriad of news outlets broadcast North Koreas success of building a nuclear missile with the ability to reach U.S PERIOD soil PERIOD

The anxiety felt by many Americans has proven evident with the prodigious amount of coverage on the topic PERIOD Citizens are questioning the potency of the threats made by Jongun and are also creating an analogous distinction between the Korean Missile Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis that occurred in  PERIOD

The obvious similarity among the two is the threat of nuclear missile launchings PERIOD However other than the  years that separate them and other specific details the main difference lies in how they were addressed PERIOD

Trump didnt hold back in his responses against North Koreas nuclear threats and it couldve been done more effectively PERIOD

North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States Trump said PERIOD They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. this angerdriven response only pushed North Korea further and Pyongyang the capital of North Korea warned that it would attack the Pacific territory of Guam along with the U.S PERIOD mainland a few hours after Trumps remark PERIOD Although conference members tried to ensure that the president had no intentions to attack North Korea many critics and allies were confused by the ambivalent message he delivered PERIOD In fact Ashley Townshend acting director for foreign policy defense and strategy at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney described Trumps rhetoric as far from helpful. his bellicose remarks on the North Korean nuclear crisis are likely to make Pyongyang even more nervous raising the odds of an unintended escalation or misunderstanding Townshend said PERIOD

Conversely John F PERIOD Kennedy handled the Cuban Missile Crisis effectively making it clear that he was ready to defend the U.S PERIOD with nuclear war acting as a last resort PERIOD

The decision to use any kind of a nuclear weapon even the tactical ones presents such a risk of it getting out of control so quickly .. PERIOD I dont think anybody wants that weapon to escape from their control Kennedy said PERIOD

The strongly contrasting approaches to a potential threat exemplifies Trumps lack of political experience PERIOD In fact within the  years that the presidential office has existed every president has had experience with both political and military services PERIOD Making history Trump is the first U.S PERIOD president to lack this important set of skills and it shows with his inability to properly address a national threat without amplifying it PERIOD

With North Koreas myriad of empty threats in the past and habitual use of aggressive rhetoric typically unlike Trump diplomats usually refrain from using the same rhetoric to avoid further conflict PERIOD

If North Koreas actions are primarily driven by its sense of insecurity driven by a strong U.S PERIOD military presence in Northeast Asia the prospects of a cycle of threat and counterthreat by the U.S PERIOD could be very dangerous Kevin Gray a reader in International Relations at University of Sussex said PERIOD

But even after the warnings Trump claimed that maybe his remarks werent nearly as threatening as they couldve been and that he shouldve made his remarks more brutal PERIOD He goes on to say So if anything maybe that statement wasnt tough enough. the thoughtless and mindless comment did nothing more than cause North Korea to pledge to blow the U.S PERIOD from this planet as well as any other country that sides with the U.S PERIOD

Our country now faces a serious threat of another world war that all stemmed from something that couldve been avoided if our president had proper experience PERIOD Trumps inexperience with such militaristic situations and lack of knowledge in how to communicate in a clear and effective way make matters worse PERIOD

I urge you to speak up to your local government find a way to encourage your peers to vote and prevent more ignorant individuals from becoming focal points for our national government PERIOD The consequences of Trump acting as our president have negatively impacted various political policies and now our countrys safety is at risk PERIOD Its time we reflect on past leaders of our nations government and aspire to implement effective communication PERIOD
