4220,2023-05-14,"wild laughter spilled out of the Strafford Room as Comedy Centrals comedian Louis Ramey hosted Campus Activities Boards annual Funniest Person on Campus competition on Saturday between  and  p.m. PERIOD The panel featured five student comedians PERIOD

Ramey a seasoned professional who has been featured on several television comedy shows such as NBCs Last Comic Standing The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Last Call with Carson Daly introduced the first student comedian of the night sophomore communication major Kyle Sharpe PERIOD

Sharpe began by knocking over the stool on stage and then transitioning smoothly into a talk about death and how he himself wants to be put to restin Chilis restaurants PERIOD He then took a moment to acknowledge his competitors PERIOD You want your friends to succeed right Not tonight he said PERIOD

Next up was senior psychology major Ryan Pagliaro who spoke about his experiences in the alternative break challenge this spring break when he was the only male in a cabin with nine females and a story about his job in a hospital PERIOD

After a short entracte from Ramey in which he described doing comedy shows in Pennsylvania for the Amish senior theater design major Rebecca Bishop took the stage surprising the audience by dancing to the song she entered with PERIOD

Dancing is in my blood she said although she also conceded that she never took dance classes PERIOD

Her first story was one about the time her mother put a dead bird in a white paper pastry bag on her kitchen counter PERIOD

What you need to know is that my town has a general store that sells these delicious chocolate croissants and they come in little white paper pastry bagsI think you can see why this might be a problem. that day Bishop said pacing and with subtle motions that set the tone and added visuals to the performance her sister came home from school excited about a croissant and her mom quickly stopped her because there was actually a dead bird in the bag PERIOD When frantically asked why there was a dead bird on the counter Bishop relayed that her mother asked simply Where else would I put it

After a momentary interlude from Ramey out came firstyear bioengineering major Ian Root PERIOD Root told the story of his high school marching band visiting Madrid his sophomore year and sneaking around doing things one really shouldnt while on a school trip especially with his mother as a chaperone PERIOD At the time I had this thing with a seniorShe must have rebounded lowered her standardswhatever I didnt care he said PERIOD

Last up was junior history major Kaelen Caggiula PERIOD He began his performance by reciting several short original poems including two called Look Out for That Car and Thursday. he then walked the audience through a time when a stranger yelled profanities at him and he had to formulate a proper response PERIOD

The four judges including assistant director of Memorial union Building Dave Zamansky were whisked into a side room to deliberate PERIOD After a few minutes they emerged with results PERIOD

Third place went to Pagliaro Caggiula with his poetry got second and first went to Bishop who declared during her performance that because she was the only woman performing that night I am the funniest woman at UNH. what she didnt know at the time though was that she was the funniest person at UNH PERIOD She ran on stage to retrieve her prize of two tickets to see comedian Jerry Seinfeld this summer PERIOD

God I hope so Bishop said upon being asked if she wanted to incorporate comedy into her future PERIOD Doing this terrifies me but its important to push yourself to do things that scare you. the Student News Site of University of New Hampshire
