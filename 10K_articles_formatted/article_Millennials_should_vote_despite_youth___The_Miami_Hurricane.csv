I was walking out of my Zumba class when I came across a disturbing quote online from a Fox News host PERIOD

During a discussion about young people and voting The Five cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle said Theyre young women like healthy and hot and running around without a care in the world PERIOD They can go back on Tinder and Match.com. i nearly spit out my iced Starbucks latte PERIOD Did I just read that right Did a woman suggest other women skip voting and stick to swiping left and right on their iPhones

Guilfoyle believes that young women should excuse themselves from the upcoming midterm elections because they lack the same life experience as older women PERIOD She applies the same reasoning to her belief that young women shouldnt serve on juries too PERIOD

Her cohost Greg Gutfeld mentioned that with age comes wisdom and the older you get the more conservative you get. wait Fox News hosts are really discouraging young people from voting because theyre not yet older wiser and conservative

Im stating the obvious when I stress how important voting is PERIOD To disregard an entire generation is not only wrong but illogical and a strike against our democracy PERIOD

But its clear to me that the conservative Fox hosts may have a motive in trying to prevent young people from hitting the polls PERIOD

In the  presidential election youth votes were the deciding factor in President Barack Obamas overall victory after his victories in Florida Pennsylvania Ohio and Virginia PERIOD

Coupled with the fact that young people tend to vote Democratic it obvious why conservatives are trying to dissuade us from hitting the polls PERIOD

It is more than damaging to our society to try to convince anyone not to exercise one of our most fundamental rights PERIOD And because some millennials tweet song lyrics and use dating apps it doesnt mean were misinformed uninvolved and hence shouldnt vote PERIOD

In an NPR interview Ashley Spillane president of Rock the Vote a media campaign that encourages young people to vote said Young people are getting involved at a local level PERIOD They are creating startups PERIOD They are volunteering with local organizations PERIOD They are looking to take problems on in real time and fix them PERIOD They do care very passionately about issues that matter to them. i think its clear that theres more to us than social networking apps PERIOD Our voices do make a difference and have every right to PERIOD And for that I am blessed PERIOD
