The confusion of the  Student Government election has come to an end PERIOD Jono Croskey took home the majority of the votes in this weeks runoff election and will take office as student presidentregent at the beginning of the spring semester  PERIOD 

The runoff held Oct PERIOD  and  between Croskey with running mate Kyle Gunn and Joe Bilek with running mate Kane Miller rounded up two weeks filled with campaigning voting grievances and the elimination of candidate Tom Centarri and running mate Molly Miller PERIOD 

Croskey said he was glad that the campaign scandal did not prevent people from casting their votes a second time PERIOD

I feel really good that the students got out there and actually voted Croskey said PERIOD Im really glad I got their support. the total number students who voted was  which was  less than in the original election PERIOD Croskey and Gunn received  votes or . percent in the runoff election PERIOD In the initial election the team had finished last with  votes PERIOD 

Bilek and Miller received  votes or . percent PERIOD  They had gathered  votes and finished in second place in the initial election PERIOD

Sam Recob Chief Justice of the Student Judicial Court said the filing of the grievances may have been what hurt Bileks campaign PERIOD 

Its an election  he said PERIOD I think everything has an impact. bilek was unavailable for comment PERIOD

Centarri and Miller the winners of the original election Oct PERIOD  and  had been invalidated from the election after the Student Judicial Court found Centarri guilty of breaking three campaign regulations during his campaign PERIOD 

Bilek and his running mate Kane Miller had filed three separate grievances against the candidates Oct PERIOD  claiming Centarri had violated campaign financing and campaign funding rules and made promises of a tangible gift during his campaign PERIOD 

The court had found him guilty of exceeding the  spending limit for candidates receiving more than the allowed  in outside campaign funding and promising time off the study table to athlete voters which the court said fell under the definition of a tangible gift PERIOD  

Since UNO has no appeals process for Student Court decisions Centarri had tried to complain to the chancellor Nancy Belck but without success PERIOD In a personal meeting Belck explained to Centarri that the administration never gets involved in Student Government affairs PERIOD

Centarri had backed away and said he would direct his focus on his current position as chief administrative officer for Student Government PERIOD

Croskey said he hopes that the election chaos and the extensive media coverage may ultimately result in a stronger Student Government PERIOD

 I think that people are going to be more involved in whats going on and I think thats actually a good thing he said PERIOD 

Croskey said he did not feel bad about the way he won the election PERIOD He said he did his best to stay out of the argument between Bilek and Centarri and that he just was lucky his noninterference came to his advantage in the end PERIOD

Everything happens for a reason he said PERIOD
