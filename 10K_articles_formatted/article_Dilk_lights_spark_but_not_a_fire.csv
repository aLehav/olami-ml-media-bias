EVANSTON  Down nine midway through the second quarter and with sloppy play preventing any sort of rhythm the Michigan womens basketball team needed a spark PERIOD

Amy Dilk had been at the forefront of the Wolverines ugly first quarter PERIOD After turning the ball over twice in the first two minutes of the game it looked like it might be a lost night for the sophomore guard PERIOD But rather than letting her work out the kinks on the court Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico took her out four minutes into the game and talked to her PERIOD And the message resonated PERIOD

She knows I can put more effort than what Im putting in Dilk said PERIOD I need to be more dialed in from the start and thats obviously on me PERIOD Basically I just need to play harder. with  left in the second quarter Dilk saw her chance to be that spark PERIOD She poked the ball out of Northwestern guard Lindsey Pulliams hands at the 3point line and as it was rolling out of bounds Dilk dove to the floor to save it PERIOD The Wolverines called a timeout to keep possession and despite the ninepoint deficit they were fired up PERIOD

I think I owed it to my team to get some hustle plays and I think I got some tonight Dilk said PERIOD Obviously when any of our teammates dive on the floor it brings the momentum and energy up on the bench on the court PERIOD So just being able to do that and bringing the momentum up was huge for us. while Michigans play improved out of the timeout it couldnt overcome its firstquarter struggles leading to an  loss PERIOD

But Dilk wouldnt let the Wolverines go down so easily PERIOD At the top of a  zone she continued to give the Wildcats trouble deflecting passes and forcing Northwestern to reset its offense and settle for tough shots PERIOD She logged three steals in the quarter PERIOD

Offensively she settled down PERIOD While the Wildcats continued to press Dilk didnt try to force passes upcourt to avoid it PERIOD Instead she trusted her ability as a ball handler and only passed the ball when she was stifled by Northwestern defenders PERIOD

As Dilks play improved so did Michigans PERIOD But in the end it wasnt enough PERIOD After her steal the Wolverines grabbed a onepoint lead with a  run  during which Dilk scored four points and assisted on the goahead basket  but they couldnt extend it any further leaving the door open for the Wildcats PERIOD

I thought that she just started to  really take care of the ball a lot better and handle pressure a lot better Barnes Arico said PERIOD She also moved extremely well without the ball and was making some cuts and  making herself available and finish plays around the rim. in the third quarter Dilk showed no signs of slowing down PERIOD She continued to give the Wildcats problems defensively and offensively she only improved PERIOD When Dilk is at her best she is driving with confidence and going up strong qualities on full display Thursday night PERIOD

But the Wolverines struggled from the floor in the third  shooting just 4of14 and missing layups and open 3pointers  and Northwestern got hot shooting over  percent PERIOD Dilk gave Michigan muchneeded baskets and kept them in the game scoring eight of her  points in the third and the Wolverines led with  left PERIOD Though the Wildcats ended the quarter on a  run and there wasnt much Dilk could do to keep the game from slipping away PERIOD

Shes such a great passer that as soon as you bring through two or three at her shes dropping it off to me or dropping it off to freshman center Izabel Varejo sophomore forward Naz Hillmon said PERIOD Shes very unselfish but it does help us a lot when shes able to get into the paint and get those buckets. dilk got those buckets but the rest of the Wolverines couldnt follow suit PERIOD
