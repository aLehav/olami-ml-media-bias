3270,2023-11-04," writes Alexander Pope whose poem  lent this wonderful fantasia its title 

Joel Barish Jim Carrey is one of Popes blameless vestals PERIOD  After his girlfriend Clementine Kate Winslet leaves him Joel cannot determine how their relationship failed or why she now acts as if theyve never met PERIOD

The latter is easily answerable Barish discovers that she underwent brain surgery at Lacuna Inc. a psychiatric firm founded by Howard Mierzwiak Tom Wilkinson that specializes in 

Acting out of personal retribution Joel receives the treatment himself hoping to cleanse Clementine from his thoughts PERIOD

After Mierzwiaks staff commences the late night operation however Joel realizes the value of those memories PERIOD Hoping to preserve Clementine in his past he embarks on a whirlwind goose chase through his mindscape leaping through their cherished moments while attempting to smuggle his ex into

memories where the Lacuna team cannot find her PERIOD

Despite his efforts Joels mental world pummels forward in the forgetting  and the cerebral dynamic makes for a literally dizzying headtrip PERIOD

Beautifully constructed immensely moving and resplendent with bursts of emotions colors and moods  is a Valentines Day card for the spurned lover in all of us PERIOD Onscreen romantic

bliss hasnt been this weirdly fetching since Barry Egan and Lenas liplocked silhouette in  ebullient Hawaii sequence PERIOD

Cinematic romanticism also hasnt been as unconventionally plotted or transcendent PERIOD While Paul Thomas Anderson and Adam Sandlers  collaboration artfully glided over the emotional specificities in Egans

relationship  gazes at a relationship in its entirety lingering over the passing details the backward glances and the guarded conversations between two lovers PERIOD

This fantastical pastiche of memories results in one of the grandest most poignant love stories in quite some time PERIOD

The fact that director Michel Gondry the Frenchman responsible for the White Stripes recent string of video triumphs and Charlie Kaufman who penned the outr  cooked up the scenario is

additionally remarkable PERIOD Known for their conceptual brilliance and originality the resonance they achieve here is unprecedented PERIOD

The reclusive Kaufman always interspaces his plots with personal graceful feeling PERIOD With Joel and Clementines relationship however the curlyhaired wit fashions his most fully realized story PERIOD Equipped with a fractured

chronology and Kaufmans sleeveworn cleverness every character feels more wellrounded and realer than ever before PERIOD Hes also found another felicitous director in Gondry who can stand alongside Spike Jonze as a Kaufman collaborator PERIOD

Gondry previously adapted Kaufmans  an underrated debut that hints at the visual bravado he brings to their latest joint effort PERIOD The director mounted  with the imaginative enthusiasm and

confidence of an old pro PERIOD He stages terribly complex sequences  set in a mans proverbial mindscape no less  at perfect offkilter tones allowing his two leads room to make mindhopping look like the most natural thing in

the world PERIOD

Equally astonishing is the lead performance of Carrey who attains the perfect mesh of humor and pathos hes been pursuing for years PERIOD Joel is the most atypical character Carreys ever played Reserved pensive unsure of

himself hes the polar opposite of Ace Ventura and unquestionably gives rise to the actors finest performance PERIOD

Initially Winslets rebellious Clementine is offputting maybe even grating at times PERIOD But the actress inflects her character with vulnerability and compassion and by the zigzagging third act Clementines zeal could melt an iceberg PERIOD

The adroitly cast Lacuna employees are very amusing PERIOD Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst take a respite from their franchise appearances and give loose relaxed performances cast against type as a nebbish technician Mark

Ruffalo is his typically flawless self and Wilkinson manages to bring gravitas and integrity to his small role as Lacunas founder PERIOD

In spite of its outlandish qualities and chaotic rhythms Kaufman and Gondrys film is hardly as esoteric or impenetrable as the story suggests PERIOD

Like a first meeting between soul mates or a fading image of ones first kiss it harnesses onto your mind and stays there offering a treasure trove of passion hesitation pain regret and love PERIOD Its an outright masterpiece PERIOD
