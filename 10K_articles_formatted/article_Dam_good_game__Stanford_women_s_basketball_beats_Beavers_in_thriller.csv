5305,2023-01-28,"no PERIOD  Stanford womens basketball   Pac12 outlasted Oregon State   Pac12  in a thrilling game at Maples Pavilion on Friday night PERIOD An incredibly tight game looked destined for overtime before senior guard Haley Jones kept her composure to knock down three free throws in the final minute handing Stanford its narrowest win of the season PERIOD

One interesting matchup noticed from the outset was the battle of the forwards as junior Cameron Brink faced a tall task against 6foot9 sophomore Jelena Mitrovic one of the few matchups all year in which Brink held a height disadvantage PERIOD

The first quarter set the tone for a competitive night of basketball with both teams displaying physical defense and signs of explosive offense albeit with different approaches PERIOD Stanford showed off its usual display of fluid passing moves and darting drives to the basket whereas Oregon State was dangerous from 3point range going 8for19 over the course of the game PERIOD

Defense prevailed in the opening exchanges particularly from Stanford as Brink blocked a pass to set up a play scored by freshman guard Talana Lepolo who was back on the court and in the starting lineup one week after she sustained an ankle injury against Utah PERIOD Brink and junior guard Agnes EmmaNnopu then each blocked shots before the latter stole under the basket and scored a reverse layup to retain the lead for Stanford PERIOD

But the Beavers responded emphatically with two 3pointers in quick succession followed immediately by a stealandscore PERIOD As the quarter wound down it was Stanfords turn to respond as sophomore Brooke Demetre drained a 3pointer typifying Stanfords nextwomanup mentality PERIOD Then EmmaNnopu was left all alone for the 3point attempt and scored to flip the score in Stanfords favor as the quarter ended  PERIOD

In the second quarter Stanford quickly extended its lead with a 3pointer by senior guard Hannah Jump after the Beavers failed to score from their first possession PERIOD The Cardinal doubleteamed Mitrovic which allowed freshman guard Indya Nivar to steal the ball but the possession came to nothing part of a three minute scoring drought for both teams PERIOD The Beavers found their rhythm first with two more 3pointers but Jones and Brink each scored to keep the lead at five PERIOD

Mitrovic then delivered with a defensive rebound jump shot and assist to hand the Beavers the lead PERIOD In response Brink drove to the basket and was fouled converting both free throws to give Stanford a narrow  lead at halftime PERIOD

No one can stop her head coach Tara VanDerveer said of Brink PERIOD Doubled tripled and she was still scoring. in the beginning of the third quarter sophomore forward Kiki Iriafen was fouled twice and gave Stanford three of its  total points from the free throw line PERIOD In comparison Stanford had played an incredibly clean first half and gave Oregon State no scoring opportunities from the free throw line they surrendered just two points from the line the entire game PERIOD

The Beavers continued to respond with threes of their own although they also committed four team fouls in as many minutes the last of which saw Brink halve Stanfords deficit to two after a blatant violation allowed her to retry an unsuccessful free throw PERIOD Brink then tied the game with a layup as she scored six consecutive points PERIOD

The Maples crowd  always strong in numbers for the womens team  was equally strong in voice tonight PERIOD With two minutes left in the quarter the whole stadium erupted into chants of Defense in a showing of support which rivaled that of a playoff game PERIOD However the Beavers seemed unfazed and hit yet another 3pointer before Brink came agonizingly close with a jumper which fell in and out PERIOD

In the last possession of the quarter Lepolo found Brink at the top of the arc for a wide open 3point attempt PERIOD Brink missed but Jones pounced on the rebound and found a way to make the shot at the buzzer to tie the game at  after  minutes of play PERIOD

In the fourth quarter Stanford utilized EmmaNnopu and senior forward Fran Belibi to add some more defensive steel PERIOD

Agnes defense was awesome VanDerveer said PERIOD Frans was great too. and it seemed to be paying off for the Beavers did not score in the opening three minutes of the quarter PERIOD Stanford meanwhile extended its lead to six points after Jones took matters into her own hands carrying the ball forward and making a jump shot on two consecutive plays PERIOD

In a frantic next few minutes the Beavers knocked down a 3pointer before EmmaNnopu countered from deep PERIOD Brink was then outmuscled by the Beavers forward but returned the favor at the other end PERIOD This passage exemplified the games flow as each team exchanged blows and rose to the challenges presented by the other PERIOD

Oregon State tied the game in the penultimate minute as senior guard Bendu Yeaney made a terrific play driving towards the basket and finishing with a jumper as she crashed to the ground PERIOD This set up an incredibly tense final minute PERIOD First EmmaNnopu and then Jones secured offensive rebounds illustrating the Cardinals unwillingness to relinquish possession at such a crucial stage PERIOD Jones was fouled and converted both free throws to give Stanford a twopoint lead PERIOD

The Beavers then had two chances to tie the game but missed both shots forcing them to start fouling Stanford PERIOD Their fifth foul was met with controversy as a reach was called on a play in which the defender appeared to have cleanly taken the ball from Jones despite intending to foul her PERIOD Nonetheless Jones made one of the free throws and Oregon State trailed by three PERIOD After a timeout the Beavers missed a 3point attempt but collected the rebound and drew a common foul with just . seconds remaining PERIOD

In the final play of the game great mantoman marking by Stanford forced a weak inbound pass which was corralled by Lepolo PERIOD She gratefully hugged the ball as time expired with Stanford edging the contest  PERIOD

Well we got our moneys worth remarked an excited fan as he left Maples Pavilion PERIOD

Next up Stanford will takeon Oregon   Pac12 at Maples Pavilion on Sunday PERIOD Tipoff is set for  p.m PERIOD PT PERIOD
