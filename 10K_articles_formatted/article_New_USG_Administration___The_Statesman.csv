Remember Me



Fridays USG elections were a landslide for The After Party with Adil Hussain becoming the new president PERIOD It wasnt surprising that he won after his party had a huge campaign across campus and the unpopularity of the incumbent candidate Anna Lubitz PERIOD Though Yiufat Lam also worked hard on his campaign he lacked a larger named party to stand with PERIOD

Though I am happy to see change in the positions of the student government based off the campaign that The After Party ran on I have my reservations PERIOD

It was a brilliant marketing campaign on all aspects PERIOD The party used Youtube Twitter Facebook and posters to spread their names PERIOD It built a brand that everyone could recognize when they went to vote PERIOD But the problem with most of the candidates was that no one focused on hisher platform PERIOD What does Hussain stand for

His rebellious nature is exciting fresh and muchneeded for most students after what they saw as a bad year for USG PERIOD But will he deliver on his promises of transparency a studentfirst mentality and most of all fostering a new relationship between the student body and administration

This election has brought up larger issues at this University PERIOD Students hate elections apparently PERIOD Please correct me if Im wrong on this statement but with  undergraduates only  votes were cast for USG President PERIOD Many students had complaints against Lubitz for not properly representing the student body yet no one was willing to do anything PERIOD No one complained during the year she was in office PERIOD Even during elections only  students even cared to cast a vote for the person who would be in charge of overseeing distribution of money to clubs activities and other campus events PERIOD USG plays a huge role in building a campus life yet many are okay with settling on just blaming the government when really the student body has the say in what happens PERIOD

With the fee continually going up for our student activity fee the platform of a candidate is important in determining how the money will be spent PERIOD As we saw with Lubitz and her connections it made her relationship with the students fairly cold PERIOD This isnt saying Hussain will be the complete opposite as his campaign has raised eyebrows in administration PERIOD Hussain may be the polar opposite of Lubitz but because of that he could have a problem all year passing through ideas only to be shut down with an unreceptive administration PERIOD

The After Party made a video before elections on slam dancing stating it was the reason Kendrick Lamar and Steve Aoki werent able to perform on campus PERIOD As creative as the video was it was a little disturbing PERIOD Even the name of the party gives off the impression that a large portion of the campus cares more about their social and party life more than anything PERIOD While this is a huge assumption Im sure its a safe bet to say administration will have its work cut out the next year PERIOD

Anusha is a history major with a specialization in Latin America PERIOD She started as a contributing writer her freshman year and is currently the Assistant Opinions Editor PERIOD Journalism has always been an interest as much of public opinion comes from the daily news PERIOD After graduation she hopes to further her studies in either law or history though much like her opinions is subject to change PERIOD Her experiences abroad have given her insight into how much of the world lives operates and why covering foreign affairs is necessary PERIOD Her trips to Guatemala Peru Kenya Cambodia and many others have shown how fortunate Americans are and why history is the key to changing foreign policy PERIOD
