In recent years Marist has continued to produce a plethora of accomplished alumni and Skyler Caruso is a worthy addition to the list PERIOD

Skyler Caruso  is a recent Marist graduate currently working as an Editorial Assistant for PEOPLE magazine PERIOD At only  years old she earned a position as a social media correspondent for Seventeen Magazine where she had the opportunity to interview redcarpet talent all throughout high school PERIOD

Carusos work granted her direct access to award shows like the MTV VMAs and popular music festivals like Coachella and Firefly PERIOD Though exhilarating the experience taught Caruso at an early age to perfect the art of what she calls checking the fangirl at the door. understanding that the work between the talent and myself is a collaborative experience not a fan experience. caruso said PERIOD Upholding a sense of professionalism and respect is a must when working with celebrities. the skills Caruso learned at Marist such as adaptability and time management have helped her at PEOPLE magazine PERIOD In her time as a Communications major at Marist she worked under companies like Sony Entertainment The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and NBC Universal all while exploring her love for all things entertainment and pop culture PERIOD Caruso also served as both a host of Marists Word on the River and as a campus tour guide for incoming students PERIOD

Carusos life varies as an entertainment journalist PERIOD As a member of the SEO team her morning typically begins with a scan of Google Trends and Analytics before constructing a list of searchfriendly pitch ideas to her team and editor PERIOD Depending on the day and length of her piece she will write  articles a day for PEOPLE digital which are often reactive or predictive to current news PERIOD Her job grants her an ample amount of creative freedom and every day is dependent on the daily news cycle PERIOD

Between pitching unique angles for stories and creatively crafting sentences to tell an engaging story one of my favorite parts of my job is that I get to be creative every single day. she is also not just limited to PEOPLEs office PERIOD Recently Skyler has had the chance to travel to places like Coachella in California and New York Fashion Week for event coverage pieces PERIOD Some of her alltime favorite conversations have been with celebrities Shawn White Alicia Keys and Drew Barrymore PERIOD

For current Marist students looking to pursue a similar path Caruso advises three things PERIOD Regardless of the year you are in she encourages students to hone in on their interests as often as possible whether through starting a blog writing for the campus newspaper or taking part in MCTV PERIOD She also advises reaching out to admired professions in the field to learn more about their work PERIOD

Tell them you look up to them and that youd like to learn more about what they do. skyler adss PERIOD A little message demonstrating interest and passion can go a long way Additionally Caruso urges students not to be afraid to ask questions of professors who have professional experience and can offer great advice for your future PERIOD

Perhaps her biggest piece of advice however comes from what inspired her to be where she is today  realworld handson experiences. in fact it was Carusos final internship back with TigerBeat Media as a senior that helped push her in her final direction PERIOD

Not only was it a full circle moment with my tween self  but it was the job that solidified my decision to pursue entertainment journalism full time post graduation she said PERIOD

The multiple internships Caruso accumulated throughout the years really gave her the ability to find herself in the world of journalism and its a world that she still loves today PERIOD

Ive had an interest in allthings entertainment and pop culture for as long as I could remember PERIOD But it was my handson work experiences  where I was literally writing creating and contributing on the daily  that ultimately made me pursue my passion she said PERIOD
