STATE COLLEGE  In Wednesday nights  win over Penn State the Michigan hockey team gave up  shots on goal  its most through its first seven games  with many coming from dangerous spots PERIOD Michigan coach Mel Pearson prophesized that the Wolverines would have to limit the Nittany Lions chances in order to leave State College with two wins PERIOD

On Thursday they failed to correct this problem as their inability to keep Penn State out of the offensive zone caught up with them PERIOD While Michigan was able to match the Nittany Lions for the first portion of the game Penn States offensive prowess was eventually too much to keep up with PERIOD The Nittany Lions  overall put  shots on net leading to a  loss for the No PERIOD  Wolverines  overall  Big Ten PERIOD

I just think we gotta be more prepared junior defenseman Nick Blankenburg said PERIOD Obviously it puts you on your heels a little bit when they score the first shift but its how we react and we gotta do a better job at dealing with adversity. after not getting on the board until the third period in Wednesdays game Penn State got off to a fast start on Thursday PERIOD Just  seconds into the game forward Aarne Talvitie brought the puck into the offensive zone and ripped a shot on net from a tough angle that snuck over junior goaltender Strauss Manns shoulder PERIOD

Less than two minutes later the Nittany Lions added another PERIOD From behind the net forward Xander Lamppa placed a pass directly in front of the net for forward Jared Westcott who pulled back the puck and shot it past Mann PERIOD Down by two just over two minutes into the game Michigan had a big hole to climb out of PERIOD

The first shot went in the net Michigan coach Mel Pearson said PERIOD Bad angle shot beat Strauss PERIOD I dont know even how it went in and gave them some momentum PERIOD And then obviously from that point on they get the second one. but the Wolverines responded quickly PERIOD Twenty seconds after Wescotts goal Blankenburg put a farside wrist shot over goaltender Oskar Autios blocker PERIOD Later in the period Blankenburg scored an equalizer this time on a power play PERIOD

Early in the second period it looked like the Wolverines were ready to pull away PERIOD After holding Penn State scoreless for the final  of the first period and scoring two goals of their own they took their first lead of the game on a backhand goal from sophomore defenseman Cam York PERIOD

Three minutes later the Nittany Lions answered with a power play goal of their own but Michigan tried to stymie Penn States momentum quickly when freshman forward Thomas Bordeleau potted one PERIOD

But from there it was all Nittany Lions PERIOD The shots the Wolverines had been rejecting the night before suddenly were all finding the back of the net PERIOD

Freshman defenseman Owen Power blocked a shot with his skate but it rolled right back to Penn State forward Christian Sarlo who found defenseman Jimmy Dowd wide open for a goal PERIOD A deflected shot just barely trickled past Mann and freshman goaltender Erik Portillo  who replaced Mann for his first collegiate appearance halfway through the second period after the Nittany Lions sixth goal  suffered a similar fate on a rebound PERIOD

Three of Penn States five second period goals came on the man advantage as Michigan failed to kill a single penalty in the period PERIOD

When you score goals then you get momentum and we couldnt kill a penalty Pearson said PERIOD They get momentum from that PERIOD So weve got to learn to keep control keep our cool and just play the game PERIOD We have to stay on the ice. the Wolverines trailed  by the time the second period ended having been outshot  by the Nittany Lions up to that point PERIOD Michigan looked utterly defeated PERIOD

While the Wolverines held Penn State scoreless for the first  minutes of the third period and scored one of their own  before the Nittany Lions scored an emptynetter and a late power play goal  it didnt matter PERIOD Michigans goaltending could not bail it out early and its offense couldnt get it back in the game later on resulting in the Wolverines worst loss of the season against a previouslywinless Penn State team PERIOD
