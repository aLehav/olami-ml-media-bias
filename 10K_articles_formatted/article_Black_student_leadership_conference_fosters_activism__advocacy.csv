The conference provided an opportunity for attendees to network with other black students and form connections to aid them throughout their college careers and postgraduation PERIOD

Black Student Union President Joshua White believes this conference is invaluable for black students PERIOD

The Black Student Leadership Conference is about developing and cultivating black student leadership and black excellence White said PERIOD Were also earning from black professionals that come to speak PERIOD Its great that Towson holds this event because it creates a holistic level of success that we can see ourselves in. freshman athletic training major Kenya Downey was mainly drawn to attending the event because she was curious. i like leadership conferences so that I can network Downey said PERIOD As a black student I feel as though I can benefit a lot from this PERIOD I hope to attain connections to businesses as well as people to reach out to post college. similarly freshman childhood special education major Zoe Bridges was eager to discuss the positive impact that conferences such as this have on her PERIOD

I enjoy conferences and by attending this I can better myself as a member of the black community Bridges said PERIOD Being at a predominantly white institution this conference allows me to be amongst people that I can relate to PERIOD I hope that by attending this conference I can network and make meaningful connections. students who attended the conference had the opportunity to hear keynote speaker Luke Cooper the CEO of FiXT PERIOD FiXT provides technological support for devices like broken phones and laptops PERIOD Cooper spoke about rising above adversity and a troubled childhood to reach his goals PERIOD

All of the males in my family were either in jail or dead Cooper said My mother did not want that for me PERIOD So one Saturday morning she asked a pilot to take my brother and I on a tiny plane that allowed us to see the projects that we grew up in and the world outside of it PERIOD I realized that I had to get out of the projects and I learned that to do that it didnt take luck it took hard work and determination. cooper is continuing to expand his business and work with various companies that heavily utilize technology PERIOD

He encouraged students to be persistent in their pursuit of their goals PERIOD

Take two minutes out of your day to define your own path Cooper said This is a story about hard work and determination PERIOD So keep working keep learning keep shining and Ill see you at work on Monday. the Towerlight Today is our newsletter that comes out MondayFriday during the semester PERIOD
