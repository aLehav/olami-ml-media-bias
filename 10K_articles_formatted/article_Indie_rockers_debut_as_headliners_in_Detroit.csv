One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

In a miraculous turn of events at the Magic Stick on Thursday night the colliding worlds of hippie jamsters and altrock snobs were brought together in a mishmash of musical styles PERIOD The Secret Machines brought their brand of distant space rock to this diverse crowd for a night of arenasized fuzz PERIOD The band took the stage quietly after a discocharged set by L.A PERIOD dancepunkers Moving Units PERIOD The Secret Machines set ran through most of their debut record Now Here Is Nowhere with a few new songs from their developing sophomore album PERIOD

Bathed in a sea of blue and pink light wearing dark suits and perfectly unkempt hair the boys barely spoke a single word to the crowd PERIOD They opted instead to let their dizzying guitar effects and syncopated drumbeats do the talking PERIOD The trio faced each other in an intimate triangle setup while surrounded by a giant technobubble of stacks amps lighting fixtures and strategically placed strobes PERIOD Bassist and keyboardist Brandon Curtis shared singing duties with his brother and guitar noodler Ben PERIOD The two remained mysterious standing in dark shadows as they delivered awkwardly titled tunes with a harmony that was more monotonous than pitch perfect PERIOD

At times especially during their more distant weightier songs the stage possessed a strange and disconcerting ambience like being underwater PERIOD The aquatic feeling was comforting but also tiresome through their slower paced songs PERIOD Luckily this feeling was lifted for crowd pleasers like the singalong chorus of The Road Leads Where Its Led and MTV2 staple Nowhere Again. the soldout crowd was comprised of a diversified mix of aging and neohippies and their archnemeses  20something indie elitists PERIOD This combo was quite puzzling but ultimately revealed The Secret Machines eclectic appeal to both genres of fans PERIOD

This attraction allows them to bask in the collegerock limelight for long enough to secure spots in both Bonnaroo and Coachella two of the years most sought after rock festivals PERIOD How did they manage to impress promoters of both coveted galas Probably the same way they entice their diversified fanbase who are usually at each others beardedskinny throats PERIOD Their appealing mix of ambient My Bloody Valentineesque swirling guitars with Zeppelinfused riffing somehow captivated the attention of the clashing crowd PERIOD

Though sleepers like You Are Chains caused uncomfortable shifting and uneasiness among the spectators during the hourlong set The Secret Machines still managed to stun visually and provide walltowall guitar and keyboard riffs for their first headline visit to Detroit PERIOD Their homage to heavyhitting 1970s influences and late90s indie stalwarts was a hit with the numerous older fans in attendance as well as the younger neohippies and psychrockers PERIOD While their atmospheric musicianship may not have been the most innovative arrival to the music scene last year the Secret Machines conjured enough interest to bring different types of music fans together peacefully for a night of underwater bliss PERIOD
