Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Center Square  With the potential for a partial federal government shutdown looming this weekend officials across the states are bracing for possible impact PERIOD

A series of spending measures to keep various sectors of the federal government funded is tied up in Washington D.C PERIOD with a Democratcontrolled Senate at odds with a Republicancontrolled House PERIOD

While Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program subsidies are set for October U.S PERIOD Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack warned what a shutdown could mean to nearly  beneficiaries of the federallyfunded Women Infants and Children nutrition program in Illinois PERIOD

We have a contingency fund at USDA that might continue that for a day or two PERIOD Some states have leftover WIC benefits that have not been spent which could extend it for a week or so in that state but the vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits which means the nutrition assistance provided would not be available Vilsack said PERIOD

The Illinois Department of Human Services said it is monitoring the situation but the agency believes both SNAP and WIC benefits would not be impacted for Illinois customers during the month of October PERIOD

Farmers are bracing for a possible shutdown and for continued uncertainty on an updated farm bill PERIOD

Illinois Farm Bureaus Kevin Semlow said a shutdown would have an impact on farm finances by halting various federally subsidized farm loans PERIOD The timing comes during harvest when people are looking to get the best commodity prices PERIOD

Especially the marketing assistance loans which help the farmers plan for and start buying their inputs for next year Semlow told The Center Square PERIOD For many farmers thats a key tool in their financial tool belt that they need to have and without those offices being open they will not be able to go in and start that process. jumping from one crisis to the next another deadline farmers are eying is the end of the month sunset of the fiveyear farm bill PERIOD

Its gonna push that back but were still hopeful and optimistic that Congress can bring closure to the budget impasse quickly which allows them to move onto other pressing issues such as the farm bill Semlow said PERIOD

If the federal government shuts down on Sunday Vilsack said that could limit technical assistance for legislators wanting to continue crafting a new farm bill PERIOD
