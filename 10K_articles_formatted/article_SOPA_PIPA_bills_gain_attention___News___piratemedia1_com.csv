Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act which target online piracy in attempts to stop illegal sharing of copyrighted material have recently been introduced to Congress PERIOD

CNN reports the intent of SOPA is to stop copyright infringement on sites that host pirated content PERIOD The bill aims to stop overseas websites that contain media that users can download illegally PERIOD

The other act PIPA has the same intentions PERIOD

The passing of the bills has not come easy because of the vast amount of opposition faced PERIOD

Beth Winstead the universitys copyright officer believes these bills interfere with some of the basic rights of American citizens PERIOD

In our country youre innocent until proven guilty she said PERIOD With this law youre automatically guilty and then you have to prove your innocence. although the bills have drawn support from the music and film industry social media websites like Facebook and websites such as Google Yahoo eBay and Wikipedia are against the bills PERIOD They believe the bills take away from free speech and would censor the Internet PERIOD

These websites and thousands of others joined in protesting these bills by blacking out their websites on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Millions of Internet users that tried to access sites such as Wikipedia last Wednesday found that the website was shut down PERIOD Instead of having the usual content the site aimed to educate users about the SOPA and PIPA bills PERIOD Wikipedia reported that the blackout page had nearly  million views PERIOD

The other major site that drew attention for protesting was Google which blacked out their name and linked to a petition for users to sign PERIOD

The purpose of their blackout was to gain attention and according to Winstead it was effective PERIOD

Its a good example of how in the media age opposition can arise very quickly to something and get something done and change things said Charles Twardy a university instructor PERIOD

The bills have gained so much attention that Congress decided to delay the vote on the bills until a consensus can be reached PERIOD Some feel this is an eyeopening experience for Congress PERIOD

It seems to me an example of Congress not doing enough research to begin with to figure out what they need to do and how to frame a bill said Twardy PERIOD I think theyre discovering now they should have thought this out more. essentially the passing of SOPA would cut off resources that allow websites that illegally share files to exist PERIOD However similar illegal sharing that occurs on media sites like YouTube would change drastically PERIOD

Currently illegal sharing that takes place on YouTube is reported and videos are taken down if they break copyright laws PERIOD The bills would change this by holding YouTube responsible for illegal content a user posts PERIOD

If somebody put a YouTube video up that uses music which happens all the time then potentially YouTube and Google could be shut down said Winstead PERIOD

The punishment for pirating media would result in harsher punishment as well PERIOD

Now if you put something up that breaks copyright it can be a felony said Winstead PERIOD

This is a law that is real and it can touch almost all of our lives. some students feel it can affect classwork if search engines or free encyclopedias are shut down PERIOD

I think it would make simple things for school harder said junior communication science and disorders major Emily Cozart PERIOD Im not for it. cozart uses sites like Google and Wikipedia to research topics for clarifications rather than just using the textbook PERIOD

Teachers that use these resources for educating students would face the similar obstacle PERIOD

Anything that makes it more difficult for me to teach Im against said Twardy PERIOD
