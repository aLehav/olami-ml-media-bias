The Hornets and their uptempo offense which the team has nicknamed Bunky Ball was matched by the University of Antelope Valley on Saturday PERIOD Both teams sprinted up and down the court all game PERIOD Pioneers coach Deon Price matched Harkleroads substitution pattern subbing five players in five players out every  seconds PERIOD

With the fastpace play mistakes were made causing turnovers with the Hornets getting  and the Pioneers  PERIOD

We have to eliminate unforced errors Harkleroad said PERIOD You have to give Antelope Valley credit PERIOD They were very aggressive defensively PERIOD We made some decisions to pass the ball into the bleachers when we couldve held onto it PERIOD It was a good game for us because we were tested have an opportunity to learn a lot grow a lot and still come out on top. sac State and the Pioneers played a back and forth game until it got to crunch time PERIOD The Hornets held UAV without a field goal in the final  of the game and closed the contest on a  run over the final  of the game PERIOD
