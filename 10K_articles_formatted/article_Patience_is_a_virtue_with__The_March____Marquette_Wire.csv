3151,2023-11-04,"e.L PERIOD Doctorows latest offering  requires all the stamina of its title to finish but the end result is as rewarding to the enduring reader as the rape of the antediluvian South was to General Sherman during the Civil War PERIOD

That long sorrowful stretch of damage and destruction wreaked by Sherman on his March to the Sea from the inland south to Atlantic coast forms the nucleus of the novels plot PERIOD An epicstyle work  is a whirlwind of Union and Confederate sentiments most of which are interesting some of which feel like superfluous concessions to the unpopular PERIOD

 is an apt description because  switches characters scenes and sides faster than any reader could keep up with PERIOD Despite Doctorows frenetic pace however several key characters emerge as the most important Pearl a slave girl born illegitimately to a slave woman and her owner Emily Thompson a disillusioned southern Belle dispossessed of her inheritance the coldshouldered Wrede Sartorius a Union surgeon Emily uneasily attaches herself to and Arly and Will two soldiers whose loyalties fall to whichever side is most convenient PERIOD

Over the course of the novel the disparate lives of these characters overlap come apart rejoin and dissolve several times over PERIOD As previously mentioned its difficult to keep track of who has done what and why especially since Doctorow favors explaining plot developments in reverse PERIOD The result is rather like watching a set of beautiful vacation slides out of order PERIOD The individual vignettes are often haunting  Emily watches the light of burning buildings dance on the ceiling as she attempts to fall asleep Will and Arly travel through misty forest strewn with gruesome reminders of previous battles  but the novels massive scope and tremendous cast make it difficult to place them in order and follow the narrative thread PERIOD

Comparisons between  and  Charles Fraziers successful novel with a similar Civil War theme are inevitable PERIOD Although themes of love and loss are near impossible to ignore in a novel about war several characters especially Thompson and separately Will and situations bear strong similarities to those in 

That novel however succeeded because it showed how the war intervened in the lives of its characters PERIOD  takes a different track and looks at how different characters fall in and out of the wars path PERIOD That approach isnt unsuccessful but it is responsible for the yawning sections of the novel that feel like theyve been lifted straight from a history book PERIOD

Historical fiction is a tricky genre PERIOD Stay true to history too much and youve got a clunker that doesnt sell because its a history book PERIOD Add too much drama melodrama and your work is called apocryphal to say nothing of maudlin PERIOD

Doctorow has a good skeleton of a novel here but fleshes it out with too much Civil War minutiae PERIOD Good thing an attentive reader can cut though that scholarly film and see the solid moving core of this novel PERIOD
