Remember Me



His sublime beauty had my eyes blind 
No villain HE was but an ageless knave 
One would not notice HIM in the most prosaic mosaic
 But I or did HE notice me
 HE spoke this archaic language PERIOD 
To me PERIOD
 My ears did not understand 
But my soul wept PERIOD 
As if awoken from slumber Advertisement
As if my spirit craved HIS words in hunger 
Everyone else did not see HIM 
What HE saw in me PERIOD
 A pariah was HE 
But I chose to call HIM your Majesty 
I hoped and wished and prayed that HE would forgive me 
Everyone else did not see and thought that I was going crazy 
But still I followed HIM and prayed that HE would grant me amnestyhellip 
And I still follow HIM
It is no longer a clandestine truth
 I am HIS and HE is mine in this life HE is my everlasting roofAdvertisement
