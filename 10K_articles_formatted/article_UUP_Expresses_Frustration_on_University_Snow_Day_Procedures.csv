United University Professions UUP Albany Chapter released a statement last week regarding University at Albanys severe weather protocol sharing frustrations on the inconsistency of university procedures PERIOD

UAlbanys current snow protocol states that in the event of severe weather university leadership will decide to pivot and deliver all courses remotely PERIOD

The statement reads to now insist that all classes can on short notice be converted to remote instruction is striking in its inconsistency. university administration seems to assume that remote and online instruction can simply be flipped on like a switch Major said PERIOD

The COVID19related delay in the start of the semester eliminated any extra space in the academic calendar leaving virtually no way to cancel most classes without potentially impacting spring break or commencement CarleoEvangelist said PERIOD

Students and faculty are encouraged to sign up for weather notifications through the UAlbany Emergency Alerts website or to contact the emergency phone line at   PERIOD
