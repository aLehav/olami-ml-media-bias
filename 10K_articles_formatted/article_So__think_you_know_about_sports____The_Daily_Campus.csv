This aint your grandmas sports page anymore PERIOD

Last Thursday brought a changing of the guard here at The Daily Campus PERIOD With only minimal newspaper experience and an unimpeachable record as a sports fan try and guess why my name looks familiar in print I became the new sports editor PERIOD

My first action was to raid the broadcast department and hire Kate Murphy to be my associate sports editor PERIOD Kate is a newspaper pro and a sports nut PERIOD She knows more about football than any one person ought to PERIOD Think John Madden with a ponytail PERIOD

Our mission this semester is to bring you SMU sports coverage like no one else can PERIOD We want to do away with Associated Press stories you can read anywhere and focus instead on the stories that happen right here on the Hilltop PERIOD

We plan to expand coverage of varsity and club sports and also cover athletics as it affects the rest of us PERIOD Intramural coverage profiles and indepth feature stories are all in the works so keep reading PERIOD

Our success however depends on you PERIOD The DC and the sports department in particular are in constant need of writers to cover everything from basketball to wakeboarding PERIOD

Naturally we seek experienced writers but just as importantly we need people who simply know sports PERIOD

Have you ever missed a class to watch SportsCenter for a second time Do you carry your basketball shoes around with you just in case If so Im talking to you now PERIOD
