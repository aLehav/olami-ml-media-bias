Forget dreamboats PERIOD Think dream jobs PERIOD

Like the dating app Tinder but for career moves a new smartphone app called Jobr is letting users swipe yes or no on job opportunities PERIOD

Jobr allows users looking for a job to connect with employers without the hassle of a formal job search PERIOD TJ Nahigian the CEO of Jobr said the idea for the app came after he noticed that opportunities for professional experience on mobile lagged behind dating experience PERIOD

Nahigian launched the app in May  PERIOD According to Jobrs blog  recruiters and hiring managers had listed jobs by Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Nahigian said his company was not disclosing further data on the number of users or job connections at this time PERIOD

Additionally I saw a lot of similarities between recruiting and dating and thought we could improve the experience Nahigian said PERIOD

Hiring managers on Jobr include Facebook Lyft Twitter The Boston Consulting Group Yelp Houzz and Uber PERIOD Nahigian said hiring managers can post jobs on Jobr through the app or their recruiter web portal PERIOD Jobr screens each hiring companys post to verify that the jobs are real PERIOD

Jobr connects to the users LinkedIn account so that users dont have to manually enter in their profile data Nahigian said PERIOD Jobr then matches users with jobs based on the criteria found on their LinkedIn pages PERIOD

A user who is interested in the job or hiring company that comes up can swipe right on the phone screen PERIOD If the employer swipes the user yes back then the employer and jobseeker match and have an option for communication PERIOD Similarly a user not interested in the company can swipe left PERIOD The same goes for the companies on the other side of the app PERIOD If either the employer or potential employee swipes someone as a no the other party will not be notified PERIOD

We wanted to empower different candidates and recruiters for a more efficient means of exploring of their careers discovering their options as well as connecting with new candidates Nahigian said PERIOD

Jobr is similar to the app Tinder the dating app launched in  but is not affiliated with Tinder PERIOD

Though there are some similarities in the user interface to Tinder such as the method of swiping left or right to match users there are also some major differences PERIOD Jobr has a twosided marketplace that includes the recruiters or jobs and the candidates whereas Tinder only consists of one marketplace the daters PERIOD

Jobr shows companies or candidates rather than just people PERIOD There are also different considerations and I think a lot more that goes into for people who are making a decision on something that is pretty serious their career Nahigian said PERIOD

To Nahigian careeroriented apps sharing simliarities with casual dating apps like Tinder makes sense in todays world PERIOD

I think there is just generally a trend in millennials and people in general want to have more freedom and be more mobile with in their life Nahigan said PERIOD

Pitt spokesman John Fedele spoke on behalf of Pitts Office of Career Development and Placement Assistance which exists on campus to aid students in the job searching process PERIOD

Technology has certainly changed the job search process including the use of apps like Jobr that link jobseekers to employers Fedele said PERIOD However no matter the number of apps or advances in technology one cannot completely eliminate the work required in the job search process. current Pitt students about to enter the job market had mixed feelings about Jobr PERIOD

I think the app is a good idea but I dont know if I would necessarily use it said Phil Green a junior politics and philosophy major PERIOD

Megan Lundy a senior studying marketing and supply chain management said Jobr could be useful PERIOD

I think that the app is a genius idea and could really benefit college students graduating that are looking to apply to jobs Lundy said PERIOD Jobr makes it a lot easier for both a company and the applicant. jason Miller assistant director of the department of intramurals and recreation andthe owner of Active Pittsburgh  a fitness sports and recreation website  said Jobr is an interesting concept but questioned its effectiveness PERIOD

I get that it matches employers with candidates based on mutual interest but how is that any different from an employer posting an opening on a job board the candidate submitting their resume and then the two parties agreeing to schedule an interview Miller asked PERIOD

Unlike posting and seeking jobs online Miller said Jobr uses a machine learning algorithm to tailor recommendations to candidates and recruiters based on their previous swipes PERIOD

Miller also worried the apps advanced technology might limit its reach PERIOD

I know many young professionals right out of college would probably use it but what about employers that arent tied into the most current technologies and innovations Miller asked PERIOD

Some employers may not be equipped with smartphones and the latest technology but Nahigian said Jobr has a web portal for recruiters to post their jobs and speak to candidates more traditionally online instead of through the app PERIOD

While Career Services does not use Jobr or other apps the Office uses technology to assist students in the job search with FutureLinks an online career management system for internship and job postings PERIOD

Fedele encouraged students to read reviews on apps and websites like Jobr and he said they should be prepared to do the work necessary to land an ideal job to launch their careers PERIOD

Apps and other technology may make the search process somewhat easier but do not replace the personal contact one can make with an employer Fedele said PERIOD
