A proTrump mob stormed the U.S PERIOD Capitol Jan PERIOD  while Congress certified the election PERIOD Liberal and conservative members of the App State community have condemned the violence and mourn lives lost PERIOD

Jackie Park and Emily BroylesJanuary  

Last week a proTrump mob breached the U.S PERIOD Capitol as Congress gathered to certify the results of the  presidential election PERIOD Since that day Twitter Facebook and other social media outlets have banned the president from their platforms PERIOD And the House of Representatives voted Wednesday to impeach the president again  the first time a president has been impeached twice in the United States PERIOD

Now as more information about the insurrectionists at the Capitol and the presidents response is revealed people across the country including members of the App State community are moving forward with new considerations about a peaceful transition of power and the inauguration of Presidentelect Joe Biden and Vice Presidentelect Kamala Harris Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Realizing that they were in the Capitol I think thats what really blew me away PERIOD I dont think anybody thought it would go to that level said Dalton George canvassing director for the Watauga County Democratic Party PERIOD

George said what happened at the government building was inexcusable and isnt patriotism  despite the fact they were waving American flags. korbin Cummings a senior and leader of the Black at App State Collective says the Jan PERIOD  riot was frustrating shocking and disgusting PERIOD

I was surprised at how poorly the nations Capitol handled this situation especially considering that the protests they were going to have were well advertised on social media Cummings said PERIOD

She also said the police response to the Capitol riot was disturbing because of the historicallyaggressive treatment of Black Lives Matter protestors this summer and beyond PERIOD

App State College Democrats President Jenna Kubiak said white privilege and white supremacy absolutely affected how the mob was treated PERIOD

I remember seeing a picture during the Black Lives Matter protest and there was the National Guard clearly in front of the steps whereas with the attack on Capitol Hill that was not the case Kubiak said PERIOD

Cummings protested alongside friends at Black Lives Matter movement marches this summer which drew in police armed with riot gear pepper spray and rubber bullets across the country PERIOD She says that like thousands of others she faced opposition from the police PERIOD

Their response to the riots made me think about how I was treated and many of my comrades were treated in the summertime when we were tear gassed when we were pepper sprayed she said PERIOD We were shot at with rubber bullets we had flash bangs thrown at us we had tanks and we were beaten PERIOD Ive had friends who were beaten and arrested for less. app State College Republicans President River Collins said the mobs white privilege was one of the most bizarre things he noticed at the Capitol however he doesnt hold the two protests in the same regard. black Lives Matter riots hurt people destroyed businesses killed innocents  and ruined livelihoods PERIOD This was a takeover of the Capitol building that scared politicians Collins said PERIOD I think that innocent people getting pulled into something and their lives getting destroyed over something theyre not involved in at all the majority of them is terrible. collins said he finds the the loss of life and police injured at the Capitol tragic PERIOD He also said he doesnt hold Black Lives Matter activists accountable for lootings and riots but blames the few extremists in the mix of good people peaceful protestors. as a Black female organizer living in a small town in the South Cummings says she and her family members worry about her safety when she is organizing because of the possibility of violence like that at the Capitol PERIOD

Collins believes that while events at the Capitol werent entirely Trumps fault the president added fuel to the fire with his rhetoric and refusal to act PERIOD

Ive been to a Trump rally PERIOD He knows how to fire his people up and make them feel like they got screwed and a lot of people dont really think far beyond that Collins said PERIOD

Collins says he thinks critically about the presidents words but other supporters take Trumps words at face value PERIOD

Madison Grinsteadformer president of the App State chapter of Turning Point USA a farright political group active at high schools and universities across the country says that voices of Trump supporters are not often heard on her alma maters campus PERIOD

I think it is important to understand that Trump speaks to people where they are and a lot of them feel looked down upon by coastal elites or politicians who make promises that they do not seem to keep she wrote in an email PERIOD

Since the events at the Capitol national news networks have played clips from Trumps speeches including the speech the day of the riot PERIOD Grinstead said she thinks some of these clips are taken out of context PERIOD

Collins said media coverage from Jan PERIOD  has left some members of college Republicans upset PERIOD

Regardless of what really happened  at the end of the day to the media and everyone who turned on the news Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Collins said PERIOD Its disheartened a lot of people and theyre worried about the future of the party. grinstead says those who invaded the Capitol should be arrested and charged accordingly PERIOD

The simple answer is that violence should not be the answer nor should it be condoned by either political party she said PERIOD I dont think anyone is happy with the damage done nor the lives lost and I hope our country can find some unifying elements to quell the unrest that we have seen throughout the majority of . cummings agrees that the insurrectionists should be held accountable and says American politics needs a greater focus on equity and recognizing that COVID19 economic troubles and the results of the election are heightening emotions for many people PERIOD

We still have so much going on she said PERIOD So what can we do to kind of get rid of that anger and inspire people that we can be better and we can fight towards justice and equity But they have to be willing and able to do that PERIOD And they have to be willing to hold themselves accountable. with politicians criticizing the president after Capitol Hills events Kubiak has hope for the countrys leadership PERIOD

I think its important to see people from both sides standing up against what Trump is doing right now she said PERIOD I think it shows that our future leadership has potential to fight for truth and justice versus what happened and the false claims about the election by the president. your donation will support the student journalists of The Appalachian at Appalachian State University PERIOD Your contribution will help us cover some of our operational costs and continue to provide professional development opportunities for our students at App State PERIOD Thank you for your support of local journalism

A few facts you missed PERIOD The breach occurred  min BEFORE Trump finished his speech PERIOD Three unarmed intruders were killed one shot point blank who was caught by a capital policeman as she fell back PERIOD Did not need to happen PERIOD Two others both over  years old were shot outside the capital with nonlethal bullets PERIOD Causing one to fall from the scaffolding to his death this was called a medical issue PERIOD The other elderly man went into cardiac arrest after being shoot PERIOD again called a medical condition PERIOD Im not saying the violence was in any way acceptable but I would really like to see one article that told the facts and let the reader discern the whole truth PERIOD There were one million people there and a couple hundred did a really stupid destructive counter productive act PERIOD The real question that no one is asking is why PERIOD The rally plan and permits were for a March TO the capital to show support for the legislators  while the objections were heard PERIOD
Why did it turn into a mob PERIOD Even stranger why do the videos show most of the people staying between the ropes respecting the rules in the rotunda PERIOD  A few more questions Why did the capital police open some barriers and some doors and at others locations  there was extreme violence PERIOD Why was the capital police chief turned down when he requested national guard assistance before the rally PERIOD Why would a movement that chants back the blue attack the police PERIOD Theres a lot to research here PERIOD I look forward to seeing what you find out PERIOD Call it a critical thinking exercise PERIOD",University community responds to riot on U.S. Capitol – The Appalachian,Appalachian State University
