National Coach of the Year J.J PERIOD Clark and nine qualifiers from the Lady Vols track and field team traveled to No PERIOD  Texas AMs home track to face the Aggies along with a host of other top competition and they walked away with their third NCAA Indoor Track and Field National Championship in the programs history PERIOD

UT finished with  points just ahead of Texas AM with  and BYU with  PERIOD

The team showed great composure PERIOD They really dug down and did something spectacular Clark said PERIOD We were going in as the underdogs at Texas AM and this team showed great composure great savvy great tenacity and they achieved something that is outstanding PERIOD My hats off to them and the rest of the coaching staff. the first night of the event was mainly preliminaries but it was also the night UTs distancemedley relay team consisting of Phoebe Wright Brittany Jones Chanelle Price and Sarah Bowman tried to improve on their time of . which had been good enough for second in world history PERIOD Even though the race appeared close through the first three legs UT was in perfect position entering anchor Bowmans run to break the world record PERIOD Price who runs the third leg of the relay ran a seasonbest turn of . pERIOD Bowman then pulled away not only the events record and American record but also the world record with a time of . pERIOD The previous record had been . set by Villanova in  PERIOD

They wanted to break this record and they really had to band together to make this happen Clark said PERIOD It has been  years since the previous record so it just shows you how long a record like that can stand with that quality and it was just good they got the chance to make it work. after the preliminaries UT had opportunities to score points in the mile and 3000meter with Bowman the 800meter with Wright the 60meter hurdles with Celriece Law and the shot put with Annie Alexander PERIOD The Lady Vols received personal bests from Bowman in the mile and Law in the hurdles when the meet was still in doubt PERIOD Bowman was up against among others Sally Kipyego from Texas Tech who had never lost in a NCAA Championship event PERIOD The race between Bowman and Kipyego was tight the entire way but Bowman pulled out a gritty final lap and stretched out at the finish line to win by only threetenths of a second PERIOD Bowmans time of . set the meet record and beat her own personal best by nearly five seconds PERIOD

Clark said Bowmans win really got the momentum going for the Lady Vols PERIOD

I was very confident in what she could do PERIOD She looked good and I knew when the pace got going Sarah was in a great spot and her leg speed was good he said PERIOD After she won Celriece came on right after and did well and Annie had a big throw it was like an effect that got things moving along. even though Bowmans win was the only victory of the day for UT they picked up a key second place finish from Law in the 60meter hurdles PERIOD Laws time of . was good enough to break UTs school record PERIOD

Law said the key to her victory was concentration PERIOD

The good thing about the race that I actually focused on myself which I usually have a problem doing Law said PERIOD I think that was the main reason the outcome was so good before the race things always get in your mind. wright also finished second in the 800meter and provided the eight points UT needed to clinch the National Title PERIOD Wright who had not practiced much because of a sinus infection went back and forth with BYUs Lacey Cramer who passed her near the end of the race for first PERIOD

When I first crossed the line I was upset because I really wanted to win  if you go for the win at the start and fall short its tough Wright said PERIOD But when I realized the eight points secured the title for us I was really proud. alexander also showed great improvement in the shot put PERIOD After finishing second in the SEC Championships she was able to set a school record mark of  feet and  inches that was good enough for third place PERIOD

Wright said the unity of the team was vital to their victory PERIOD

Our team was on point PERIOD Everyone did their share everything worked out perfectly and I think it was because our team was so supportive Wright said PERIOD I wanted Celriece to win as bad as I wanted to win and I cried a little bit when Sarah won PERIOD We were all pulling for each other just like a family. log In
