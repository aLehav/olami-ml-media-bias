As the temperature dropped this week I began to think about the different types of wines to drink with the chillier fall weather PERIOD I dont adhere to the idea that whites should be reserved for warmer weather and reds for the colder seasons but theres something comforting in pouring a fat glass of a fullbodied red wine and burritoing yourself in a blanket when its blustery and cold outside PERIOD The following is my attempt to provide a variety of options for earlyfall wine drinkingwhether youre only into reds or never deviate from the lighter wines PERIOD

accordion titleBogle Vineyards Old Vine Zinfandel loadshow

ABV 

Whats in it Zinfandel
Why I picked it This was my attempt at getting a big red I didnt know too much about PERIOD I expected it to be fullbodied and spicy with more earthiness than fruitiness but thats because I didnt research zinfandels well enough before I hit the wine aisle PERIOD Also the . aBV which is pretty middle of the road for zinfandel was the highest percentage of alcohol in a zinfandel under the ten dollar mark PERIOD The higher the ABV in this wine the bigger the flavor apparently PERIOD
My notes Instead of the complex spice and earthiness I was hoping for this red wine delivered a medium to full bodied fruit punch in the mouth PERIOD Rather than being bright and tart like in a pinot or gamay the fruit notes were jammy and somewhat sweet PERIOD I really enjoyed the first few sips but soon grew tired of the rich plum and black cherry flavor PERIOD
Basically If you like merlot and other jammy red wines this zinfandel is not much of a deviation but still offers something a little different PERIOD Its also probably better with food than on its own PERIOD
What to drink it with Meat meat and more meat PERIOD Either poultry with a rich creamy sauce or a beef or lamb dish.accordion

accordion titleAlbero Spanish Ros Wine loadhide

ABV12. whats in it Bobal which Ive never heard of before but is apparently the third most planted grape in Spain PERIOD
Why I picked it I wanted a ros but didnt want to go right to France again in the spirit of geographic diversity PERIOD Rather than the light bodied floral roses much of France produces I was looking for a richer darker ros PERIOD The Spanish section had two PERIOD Hopefully the other has more going on than the Albero PERIOD
My notes Like biting into a green strawberry this wine is all underripe red fruit and tart cherry PERIOD
Basically It almost tastes like a waterheavy red Koolaid mixture PERIOD Id pass and give the other dark Spanish rose a try or stick to something French PERIOD
What to drink it with I would choose to not drink it at all personally.accordion

accordion titleChateu de Seguin Sauvignon de Seguin loadhide

ABV 

Whats in it Sauvignon Blanc
Why I picked it Initially I grabbed a California Sauvignon Blanc but put it back because I already had the California zinfandel in my cart and wanted more geographic diversity PERIOD So I went across the aisle to France PERIOD I picked the Chateau de Seguin because I thought the bottle was prettier than the other White Bordeaux of the same price PERIOD Sometimes picking a wine is nothing more than aesthetics PERIOD
My notes While a little tart and citrusy with notes of lemon and lime this wine is light bodied dry and bright PERIOD As typical of old world wines from France Italy Spain Portugal and Germany the countries where wine making originated it was better paired with food than drunk on its own but that didnt stop me from finishing the bottle after I finished my meal PERIOD
Basically If you love New Zealand sauvignon blancs give a White Bordeaux a go PERIOD Youll miss a lot of the grassiness but the tart citrus notes are still present PERIOD And dont mind the smell of cat pee PERIOD Its typical promise PERIOD
What to drink it with I had it with goat cheese stuffed chicken breasts which was perfect PERIOD Anything goat cheese really PERIOD Or a dozen east coast oysters from Marianos during weekday happy hour PERIOD
