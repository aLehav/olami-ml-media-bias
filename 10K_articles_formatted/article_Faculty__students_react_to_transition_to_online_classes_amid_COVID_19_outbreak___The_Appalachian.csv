After the UNC Systems reaction to COVID19 App State faculty staff and students hold concern for whats to come of the transition from inperson to online learning PERIOD

Per the email App State sent to students March  the university is extending spring break until  a.m PERIOD on March  PERIOD The university still remains open PERIOD

Starting March  App State will transition to alternative course delivery methods. students were told through the same email that they will be provided with further information for future classroom instruction March  PERIOD

Firstyear student Tehan McMahon said she understands the change PERIOD

As a freshman I dont want to do online learning but for the safety of our community meaning people residing in Boone and older professors and faculty I think it is considerate of their health since they are more at risk to die and become sick from it McMahon said PERIOD

According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services adults older than  and those with chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID19 PERIOD

Adam Hege assistant professor of public health wrote in an email that it is important everyone show an extra sense of empathy and seek to support one another PERIOD

These are not normal times therefore we should not expect the normal academic or Appalachian experience over the next several weeks Hege said PERIOD

Hege said that as a public health professor it is intriguing to follow the news around the world and to be a voice for the community PERIOD

Prior to the break I had mentioned to our students that this is a time where weve heard the words public health much more than we typically do PERIOD We have public health efforts around us all of the time but we often fail to recognize it until a crisis such as COVID19 is upon us Hege said PERIOD

In the United States there have been  cases and  deaths as of March  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PERIOD As of March  the CDC recommends that for the next  weeks inperson events consisting of  people or more be canceled or postponed PERIOD

Senior Mason Lyons said upon moving from inperson to online instruction there should be an emphasis on oneonone Skype or Zoom meetings between students and professors PERIOD

This transition is undoubtedly going to be tough for many students and professors alike so I think being sure professors have a way to communicate live with students is vitally important Lyons said PERIOD

Associate Professor Carolyn Edy said faculty and staff have been preparing for the switch PERIOD

What Im hearing is that even faculty who have never taught online before or those who think its not necessarily a good fit for their classes are more than ready to do so because everyones health and wellbeing has to come first associate journalism professor Carolyn Edy said in a text message PERIOD

Edy continued and said department chairs have been asking us all week what we need in order to shift classes online offering training sessions and generally trying to figure out what everyone needs in order to make it work as smoothly as it can. moss Brennan contributed to this story PERIOD
