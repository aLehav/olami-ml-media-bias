This past weekend I participated in the Muslim Student Association Showdown PERIOD This is the second year in a row that the UTK MSA has hosted students from different states to come compete in sports arts trivia and literary competitions PERIOD The theme for the weekend was The Struggle is Real. usually that phrase is preceded by a hashtag and accompanied with a first world problem but for a lot of young Muslims living in America it can really be a struggle PERIOD With teams coming from as far as St PERIOD Louis and Baltimore to as close as Nashville and Atlanta it served as a great way for young people going through the same struggles to connect with one another PERIOD There was a spoken word portion of the competition where I performed a personal piece that I had written PERIOD I ended up winning first place with the piece  which I still dont understand how shout out to Naeem Baig and Drost Kokoye PERIOD I have been encouraged to share my piece here in my column so here it is PERIOD

Ripped

As a child mama painted my mind with African Majesty

Daddy sculpted Black pride into my heart

Then they mixed in some faith to complete the work art

I am Ripped

Or you could say that I am torn

Between the world I know nothing of

The world I am afraid to fall in love with

And the world where my soul was born

Without Justice

You Know they tell you about the slave ships

The long trip across the ocean

The crack of the whip and

The hardships that came along with having

A flat nose and big lips

I am ripped

In grade school we learn about history

Bleached in a picture perfect world where

Black is wack and White is alright

They say they are color blind

As I am a shell of an outline

Where someone forgot to color in between the lines

Blind to the Aura before their naked eyes

Blind to this faith from the divine

So close but at times left so far far behind

Without Justice

I see them living young wild and free as they say and

In some small way I still want to be them

Wouldnt it be so easy to breezy and bea u tiful

But whats it mean to be beautiful if you cant be you

I am ripped

Use another food reference to describe the tone of my skin

Because you know I just cant get enough of your objectification

Tell me how I taste in this white washed world

Where my culture is served bite size so you can swallow it easier

Without Justice

It is obvious in this day and age my presence is too loud too pronounced

In this day and age my presence is too proud to pronounced

I dare to have the audacity to demand justice

To defy the oppressors that cling so tightly to the word

I am Ripped

Defined during a time where my place would have been on my hands and knees scrubbing the masters floor or maybe more

During a time where gods words justified my filthy state

Theres that word again justice

Without Justice

They say keep your head down do well in school

Maybe then you might survive

Maybe then you can go out and bring your brothers and sisters back some justice

Dont rock the boat dont speak too loud

Dont turn those ripples into waves because then you will feel the mighty fist of justice

I am ripped

Its relative based on your race religion or societal class

You can either get a pass or have it pass between your eyes and through your skull

Leaving you drenched in the scarlet flow of justice

Its almost poetic

I am ripped without justice but I am here

And as much as you want me to I will not disappear

Ill stand with my hands up

And when Im good and done and my battle is won

I

will mend PERIOD
