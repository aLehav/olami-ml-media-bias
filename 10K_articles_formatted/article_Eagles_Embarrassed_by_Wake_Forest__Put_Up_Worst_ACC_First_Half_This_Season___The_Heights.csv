Well it depends on who you ask PERIOD

On Sunday night in humid WinstonSalem N.C. Boston College   Atlantic Coast reached the bottom of the college basketball abyss PERIOD

Doral Moore of Wake Forest University   scored  points grabbed seven rebounds and recorded three blocksall career highsto end the Demon Deacons 11game skid PERIOD But his effort helped keep very much alive two ignominious streaks for the Eagles who remain winless in conference play after the  loss PERIOD

With  to go in a first half that defied all basketball logic BC head coach Jim Christian stood in front of his bench expressionless staring at Darryl Hicks PERIOD

The sophomore guard had just floated a crosscourt pass intended for Eli Carter from the left side of his own 3point line PERIOD Wake Forests Bryant Crawford swooped in for the steal and the ensuing layup pushed the score to  PERIOD

That play that gaze of utter disbelief was the low point of the low point of BCs season PERIOD

For the game the Eagles turned the ball over  times PERIOD They shot  percent from the floor including an unconscionable 6of30 from beyond the arc PERIOD They went scoreless for the games first seven minutes PERIOD Again they did not score a single point for seven straight minutes to begin the game PERIOD

On the other side of the box score five Demon Deacons scored in double figures PERIOD Wake Forest shot . percent from three and as a team dished  assists nearly four more than its season average PERIOD

Head coach Danny Mannings team was without the services of starting forward Devin Thomas who sat out for the first of a twogame suspension for violating athletic department policy PERIOD

The absence of Thomas one of the ACCs top rebounders at . per game proved a blessing in disguise for Manning because it opened up minutes for Moore Wake Forests most heralded recruit in this years freshman class PERIOD

Almost from the opening tip the contests fate was sealed PERIOD Making his first career start Moore slammed home a trio of dunks on the Demon Deacons first three offensive opportunities PERIOD

On the other end the reverse was happening PERIOD

Senior Dennis Clifford dropped pass after pass on the interior PERIOD Freshman Matt Milon blew a wideopen layup on the Eagles first possession PERIOD Carter who rode the bench to start the game due to questionable shot selection in recent action entered the lineup and immediately launched a baffling blizzard of illconceived bricks PERIOD

For the Eagles flat play from the tip gave way to anxiety PERIOD Anxiety quickly morphed into hopelessness PERIOD And hopelessness ultimately spawned indifference PERIOD The death knell tolled PERIOD

In the cruelest twist of irony in recent NCAA history Carter drilled a halfcourt shot at the buzzer before the break PERIOD The scoreboard read  PERIOD

The Eagles attempted to save face with an  run before the first media timeout of the second half but theres no saving a face thats been burned off in the fires of basketball hell PERIOD

Garland Owens two secondhalf alleyoops couldnt possibly repair the damage done in the games first  minutes PERIOD His  points and five rebounds wouldnt possibly do the trick either PERIOD

BC even outscored Wake Forest  in the second period but Christian kept his usual rotation in the game while Manning rested his starters PERIOD

After  straight lossesall but one by double digitsthe BC faithful are tired of conjuring up silver linings PERIOD

Going winless in conference play is bad indeed PERIOD

When will it all end
