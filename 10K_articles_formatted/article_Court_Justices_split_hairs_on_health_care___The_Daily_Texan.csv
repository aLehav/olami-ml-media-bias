5932,2023-07-11,"wASHINGTON  It boiled down to a debate over broccoli PERIOD And bread PERIOD And burial plots PERIOD If government can tell people to buy health insurance Supreme Court justices wanted to know what else could it make them buy

Throughout Tuesdays hearing on the health care law the justices and lawyers argued over perfect product to show the limits of the federal governments power over interstate markets PERIOD

Everybody has to buy food sooner or later so you define the market as food therefore everybody is in the market therefore you can make people buy broccoli offered Justice Antonin Scalia obviously resistant to expanding governments reach PERIOD

Thats quite different responded Solicitor General Donald Verrilli arguing for the health insurance mandate PERIOD Unlike grocery shopping medical care is a market in which your participation is often unpredictable and often involuntary. and the care of patients who dont pay gets passed on to everyone else as higher taxes and insurance premiums PERIOD

Verrilli preferred his own examples the law is like regulation of telephone rates or price supports for milk PERIOD

 How about mandatory burial insurance ventured conservative Justice Samuel Alito PERIOD Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point PERIOD Whats the difference

 Chief Justice John Roberts wanted to know if people could be forced to buy cellphones for  calls PERIOD

 Attorney Paul Clement representing  states challenging the law tried wheat PERIOD When Congress wants to help farmers he said it doesnt just make everybody in America buy  loaves of bread. but Roberts seeming to tire of the parade of products cut him off by saying that doesnt address the governments argument  that everybody needs health care and all theyre regulating is how you pay for it. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Court Justices split hairs on health care â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
