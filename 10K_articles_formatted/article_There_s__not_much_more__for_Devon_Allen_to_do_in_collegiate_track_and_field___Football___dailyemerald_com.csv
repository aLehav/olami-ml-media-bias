Devon Allen talks with reporters on August   PERIOD Kylee OConnorEmerald

Although wide receiver Devon Allen went to the Olympics to represent the United States NBCs television coverage showed him more often than not as a University of Oregon representative PERIOD

Whenever Allen was spotlighted throughout the coverage much of the talk centered around his role on the Oregon football team as well as being an Olympic track athlete PERIOD

I think that Oregon has a pretty big name already so anybody associated with Oregon is going to get a little bit more pub Allen said PERIOD Its just kind of cool you know because Im still in college representing the country as well as the school and myself and my family. thursday after Allens second day back with the football team since hefinished fifth overall in the 110meter hurdles final in Rio De Janeiro Oregon held a press conference for Allen to reflect on his Olympic experience and answer questions about his future PERIOD Most significantly the question of whether or not he will turn professionalin track and field PERIOD

I havent really decided yet but theres a goodI dont know PERIOD Well see Allen said PERIOD I guess for me its just theres not much more I could do in college track other than break the collegiate record which I was a couple hundredths off. with all of Allens success in track many wonder why he doesnt focus all of his time on track and leave football PERIOD He said he valuesplaying with his teammates and coachesin Eugene PERIOD

Football is a great thing but you know it doesnt last forever Allen said PERIOD I love these guys on the team here and I just want to play with them as long as I can PERIOD So thats pretty much the deciding factor on me whether to come back or not. despite missing the majority of fall camp Allen believes he is ready for the first game of the season PERIOD The Ducks host UC Davis on Sept PERIOD  at Autzen Stadium to open the  season PERIOD

I know the plays pretty well PERIOD Obviously I went through some stuff today and was kind of like OK maybe I need to brush up on some stuff Allen said PERIOD So Ive got about a week to do that PERIOD Well see as long as Coach Helf and Coach Lubick see fit that Im ready to play theyre going to put me in there and kind of just go with the flow and get reps and the reps will grow as the season goes PERIOD

I think we have a lot of guys that can make plays too so its not really a dire need for me to play anytime soon. track is something that Allen believes can take him places PERIOD With next years World Championships in London and the next Olympic Games in Tokyo hes not wrong PERIOD But at the same time Allen dreams of playing in the NFL PERIOD

In four years I want to win a gold medal Allen said so theres one more stepping stone to that dream but now my next dream is to play in the NFL and you know the Super Bowl is always the height of that sport too. follow Kylee OConnor on Twitter kyleethemightee
