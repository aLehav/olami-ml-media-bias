7937,2021-03-13,"on Friday Greg Goff realized a dream when he was introduced as the thirty-first baseball coach for the University of Alabama PERIOD

Twelve years ago when Goff took over Montevallos program he never imagined hed be in this position  years ago Alabamas influence over the state was more like a nightmare for Goff who remembers having to ask players more than once not to wear Alabama gear to events like tryouts PERIOD

Everybody in this state just grows up loving the Tide so as a small school in the state we had to fight that a little bit but Ill tell you what Im glad to be on this side now Goff said PERIOD

Goff spent the previous two seasons coaching at Louisiana Tech University where he led the Bulldogs to their first NCAA bid since .Goffs teams have recorded  wins at least once at each of his three stops for a total of six times in  seasons PERIOD Alabama has recorded  wins twice in that same time period  and  PERIOD

Going to a place for two years is tough PERIOD That wasnt the plan PERIOD We had an awesome awesome opportunity there and was very blessed to be there and when coach Battle called and we talked about the Alabama job I thought I was dreaming and I wouldnt have left Ruston Louisiana if it wasnt my dream job. whether he can have the same success in the SEC remains to be seen but the former Kentucky pitching coach has a plan to get the Crimson Tide back in the postseason and back to Omaha PERIOD

Goff said starting the season out with some opponents that give his team some confidence is good but Alabama has to play a challenging schedule to have a chance to return to the postseason PERIOD

We got an atlarge bid for the first time in school history at Louisiana Tech Goff said PERIOD That was because we had  or  games with top  teams. but playing good teams isnt enough for the Crimson Tide PERIOD Goffs team has to win those games and to do that he some battles to win on the recruiting trail PERIOD

I do know that in any coaching recruiting is important and you better recruit good players in this age Alabama Athletics Director Bill Battle said PERIOD In pretty much every sport where there is a professional league you need to be able to attract talent that has a chance to go to the next level and they better believe that you can develop their talent to send them to the next level. one week ago six Alabama baseball players were selected in the  MLB draft PERIOD Some of those players like fourth round pickThomas Burrows will have to be convinced that returning to play for Goff is the right decision PERIOD

Once hes spoken with current team Goff will turn his attention to the future PERIOD

Our number one goal is recruiting PERIOD Our number one goal is to win this state if kids hadnt heard from Greg Goff in the next  hours they will Goff said PERIOD Were gonna recruit this state were going to own this state. the New Joe is one of many resources Goff intends to leverage to help the Crimson Tide succeed in the postseason PERIOD Goff said the new stadium is one of the best in the country and that it will turn visiting recruits into commits PERIOD

Its a park that you can make a huge homefield advantage he said PERIOD We get the Joe packed like that theres going to be people not wanting to come play us. when teams do visit Goff said his teams will need sound pitching and good defense to win championships and when his team is on offense he wants to see his guys be aggressive PERIOD

We want to be able to lead the country in stolen bases on base percentage is very important to me Goff said PERIOD Were going to let our guys swing early and put their best swing off and try to put a ball through the wall but with two strikes were going to try to put the ball in play and make them defend the field. if he can get the right pieces in place then Goffs aggressiveness might be exactly what Alabama needs to return to Omaha PERIOD

This facility we should be hosting regionals and thats our goal is to host regionals Goff said PERIOD To bring three other teams to Tuscaloosa and to beat them and then to move on to the next round.",Dream come true: Greg Goff introduced as Alabama's new baseball coach â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
