Chris Perry is gone now PERIOD Fred Russell too PERIOD Theres not even a Maurice Clarett around to pick on anymore PERIOD

Save for the dynamite duo in Minnesota the feature backs in the Big Ten are few and far between this year PERIOD But the Big Ten coaches will say its not for a lack of talent PERIOD

The numbers seem to suggest otherwise PERIOD Only the Golden Gophers Marion Barber III and Laurence Maroney are averaging  yards a game and only five total backs have  yards or more so far this season PERIOD

This from the conference that is supposed to be built on strong running and strong defense PERIOD Well its still got one of those things going for it PERIOD

 Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said PERIOD 

The suffocating defenses roaming the Big Ten these days are some of the biggest reasons the run game has suffered PERIOD There are few squads in the conference that arent more than capable of loading up and stuffing the run PERIOD

Unless teams can dominate the trenches like the Gophers many teams in the conference have been forced to adapt to what defenses are giving them PERIOD And that means throwing the ball PERIOD

 Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said PERIOD 

Part of this transition has been bred from an influx of new coaches into the conference in the past several years PERIOD Joe Tiller and Randy Walker have both succeeded at Purdue and Northwestern respectively by running spread offenses and emphasizing the pass in their tenures PERIOD

The teams in the Big Ten are now seeking balence on offensive regardless of past philosophies PERIOD

I figure most of us have tried to become more balanced and some have become more oriented toward the passI think its somewhat becoming a trend to move away from rushing attempts which in turn decreases the rushing yards.Any time you have injuries you try and analyze themI think a lot of it is very cyclical PERIOD In  we sailed right through without any injuries to starters and thats just part of football.Three of our ACLs came on grassMaybe we should try playing on turf more PERIOD I dont know.At Idaho every day for nine years we practiced on that turf PERIOD Our kids were like lepers because there was very little skin left on their bodies. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
