6803,2023-07-26,"the football team is one win away from completing a turnaround that would secure a second consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament PERIOD However if the Bombers are to complete that turnaround they will need their secondary to complete one of its own PERIOD

The Blue and Golds secondary made costly mistakes in consecutive losses to Buffalo State College and Frostburg State University giving up five touchdowns on  pass completions in those two games and putting the team in a position in which it had to win its final three Empire  games to have a chance at making the playoffs PERIOD

The defensive backs struggles can be attributed to the lack of experience they have had playing with each other with the entire group being firsttime starters PERIOD Senior Sam Carney and junior Malik Morris saw limited time at cornerback last season but have developed a chemistry that Morris said he believes comes from their differing skillsets PERIOD

Were two different types of players Morris said PERIOD I feel like Im more aggressive PERIOD I like to press more PERIOD Sam Id say he has better technique PERIOD Just combined with that whos going to pass on us

On Nov PERIOD  Morris successfully held SUNY Brockport senior wide receiver Andrew Mrozek to  receiving yards half of which came on one play and sealed the game with a fourth quarter interception PERIOD Morris performance signifies an overall emergence among the Bomber secondary PERIOD After the Bomber frontseven stifled Salisbury Universitys tripleoption running offense on Oct PERIOD  the secondary only allowed four Sea Gull completions and senior free safety Anthony Domenick recorded an interception PERIOD

Domenick also recorded an interception against the Golden Eagles upping his total to three on the season PERIOD While he has interceptions in consecutive games he and junior strong safety Noah Poskanzer have struggled this season defending plays over the top PERIOD It was Poskanzer who was beat on a 80yard pass against Frostburg that allowed the Bobcats to tie the game late in the fourth quarter a teaching moment in the eyes of head coach Mike Welch PERIOD

Its a learning process and we learn from our mistakes Welch said PERIOD Our players work hard and take pride in that PERIOD One thing about a defensive back is that they have to have short memories. poskanzer Domenick and Morris are third fourth and fifthleading tacklers on the team PERIOD They each have more than  solo tackles proving their ability to make tackles in the open field PERIOD This will help the Bombers contain a St PERIOD John Fisher College passing offense that leads the Empire  with  touchdowns and averages more than nine yards per completion PERIOD To the secondarys credit they have only given up six passing touchdowns and have held opponents to under six yards per completion PERIOD

Morris and Carney are going to be tasked with containing the Cardinals toptwo wide receivers in sophomore Mike Collchio and senior Nathan Nigolian PERIOD Collachio and Nigolian are onetwo atop the Empire  leaderboard in touchdown receptions PERIOD They each average  yards per reception and can outmuscle their defender to make a catch downfield PERIOD

While containing Collachio and Nigolian is the primary task for the Bombers secondary it will also be facing Cardinals senior quarterback Tyler Fenti who threw his only interception of the season on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD While part of Fentis efficiency comes from the Cardinals safe passing plays he is still completing more than  percent of his passes PERIOD Poskanzer the only member of the secondary without a takeaway said if the Bomber defense wants to stop the Fentiled offense it will have to force takeaways PERIOD If it does it will validate his claim that this secondary has emerged as a special bunch PERIOD

Weve come a long way Poskanzer said PERIOD Were all new PERIOD None of us started last year but with the experience weve gone through we definitely became something special and its going to continue throughout the rest of the regular season. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
