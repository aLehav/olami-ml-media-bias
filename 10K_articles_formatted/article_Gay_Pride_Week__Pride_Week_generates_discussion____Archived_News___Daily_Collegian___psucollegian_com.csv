Collegians editorial opinion is determined by its Board of Opinion with the editor holding final responsibility PERIOD

Last week it was impossible for students to not realize that it was Gay Pride Week PERIOD

Throughout the entire week students from the lesbian gay transgender and allied communities spread a message of tolerance on campus PERIOD

There were many other things besides a rainbow flag to remind students that it was Pride Week PERIOD

There was a rally a drag show and HIV testing all to promote Pride Week PERIOD

And they did it all with the theme of Camp it UP which means to be more flamboyant or obnoxious PERIOD

Some complained about the LGBTA communitys tactics in promoting the weeks events PERIOD

Some derided the weeks theme of Camp it UP as promoting gay stereotypes and as taking away from the groups educational message PERIOD They said it did not further the gay communitys argument and pushed them back instead of ahead PERIOD

Others simply opposed the actions of the LGBTA community on the basis that they do not condone homosexuality PERIOD

Regardless of whether or not people support the issue it was very clear that the week generated discussion from both sides PERIOD

While students spoke at Old Main and Willard students and community members with opposite views were present and made their ideas known PERIOD This dialogue is the best thing the LGBTA community can hope for because it keeps the discussion going PERIOD

This is a civil rights issue and it is something that can thrive only with discussion PERIOD

Years from now it is possible that the struggles the gay community is facing will be compared to the struggles the black community in America faced for centuries PERIOD

And that community like the gay community was helped along by dialogue PERIOD

National political debates small community debates and persontoperson debates moved along the civil rights battle for millions of African Americans PERIOD

And now the gay community is depending on that discussion as well PERIOD

For years the gay community has been at the forefront of discussion on HIV and AIDS PERIOD Many efforts to educate both the gay and straight communities have been spearheaded by members of the gay community who are concerned about the spread of this disease PERIOD

And this is something that really extends to the whole community PERIOD Everyone especially on a college campus should be paying attention to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases PERIOD

This awareness was generated by discussion in the gay community PERIOD

Now the discussion about the lifestyle of the gay community could bring them civil rights PERIOD

Whether or not members of the Penn State community agree with Pride Week they can at least acknowledge that Camp it UP brought a lot of discussion and debate to University Park which will ultimately lead to total acceptance of the community PERIOD
