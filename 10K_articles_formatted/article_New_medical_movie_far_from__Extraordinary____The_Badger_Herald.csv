2805,2010-01-26,"the Extraordinary Measures website opens to a picture of Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford fiercely walking down a narrow corridor in suit jackets with the desperately clich tagline Dont Hope for a Miracle Make One. for those trying to figure out what the insufferably vague title Extraordinary Measures could possibly allude to you will have to at least watch the preview PERIOD Until then you would never guess the FraserFordfiercewalk picture had anything to do with finding a cure to glycogen storage disease  also known as Pompe disease PERIOD However until you see the movie you also will never really know how getting pharmaceutical drugs passed by the FDA could be such a frustratingly and ethically defunct process PERIOD

John Brendan Fraser Inkheart and Aileen Crowley Kerri Russell Bedtime Stories are parents of three children two of whom have Pompe disease PERIOD Such a disease causes muscle weakness and children like Megan and Patrick Crowley newcomers Meredith Droeger and Diego Velazquez to resort to electronic wheel chairs heart monitors and constant medical attention PERIOD Not to mention the emotional stress it causes the parents and the Crowleys third child PERIOD

As explained in the beginning of the movie children born with Pompe disease usually do not live past the age of nine PERIOD Patrick is six PERIOD Meredith has just turned eight PERIOD John and Aileen are becoming restless and worried PERIOD

John Crowley gives up his rising career as a midlevel pharmaceutical executive PERIOD He puts his family at financial risk and he predictably goes against all odds PERIOD But it all seems too successful PERIOD We already know Fraser will make a miracle. and he does so with the help of reluctant and eccentric scientist Dr PERIOD Robert Stonehill Harrison Ford Crossing Over who has a theoretical cure PERIOD

Boasting notions of familyfriendly moral inspiration Extraordinary Measures is formulaic PERIOD However on a closer look it seems to examine the potent business of medicine PERIOD Adapted from Geeta Anands book The Cure by screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs The Water Horse Chocolat and director Tom Vaughan What Happens in Vegas Extraordinary Measures exposes the capitalistic ruthlessness behind biotechnology PERIOD

As CBS Films first release it accomplishes exactly what any familyPG movie would PERIOD The movie is undoubtedly a tearjerker PERIOD Crowley and Stonehills relentless attempts to find funding for the cure to Pompe disease run them into multiple financial and legal obstacles PERIOD It is when we see how a commercial lab is built and run that Jacobs and Vaughan offer any sense of excitement or originality PERIOD

The plot of the movie offers no surprises PERIOD However Ford and Droeger offer two of the stronger performances PERIOD In some ways Droegers character felt it necessary to counter Frasers awfully bland and forced emotions PERIOD Fords constantly infuriated ego adds both humor and honest personality  think of Indiana Jones affected ego  somehow it works and fits his character PERIOD However Fraser and Fords relationship becomes yet another clich two incompatible characters come together to find a cure PERIOD

Russells performance adds comfort as she exudes a more realistic role as a parent when compared to Fraser PERIOD Yet her adorable J PERIOD Crewesque look is all too perfect PERIOD She takes a backseat to her husbands agenda PERIOD She rarely shows any signs of discontent or emotional distress which seems odd when taking care of three children two of whom are in wheel chairs and slowly loosing control over their muscles PERIOD Its unrealistic PERIOD She does add to the optimistic and inspirational tone that this movie drives home so in some respect she does her job well but does little to nothing in offering a real sense of what mothering two very sick children might be like PERIOD

The movie is sheer Hollywood PERIOD Considering CBS created an advertisement campaign so obtrusive its no wonder the movie opened this weekend with a dismal  million  PERIOD

Without its heavily weighted cast Extraordinary Measures could easily be made into a TVmovie PERIOD If CBS had aspired for something more than tearjerking its new audiences around with PG writing Extraordinary Measures might have a chance at actually being inspirational PERIOD

  stars out of  PERIOD
