The Stumo Conferencehas been a highlight of winter break to those who have gone in the past PERIOD

There definitely wasnt a better way I could have spent those four days over winter break PERIOD I truly met some of the coolest people at theStumo Conference PERIOD I had never experienced an atmosphere where thousands of college students were striving to grow spiritually strengthen their personal characters and grow in leadership Cobb said PERIOD

The conference strives to teach students how they can be leaders in their communities as both everyday and spiritual leaders PERIOD

One of the biggest things that Ive taken away from the Stumo Conferenceis the importance of leadership and community within college .. PERIOD making the most of your college experience to have a solid community of people and then moving forward out of college to have that same kind of mindset said energy management senior Zachary Johnson PERIOD

Johnson has attended the Stumo Conference since he was a freshman and has enjoyed meeting students from all over the Midwest who hold similar interests he said PERIOD
