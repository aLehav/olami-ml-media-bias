Professor of Psychology Dr PERIOD Chris Kilmartin leads a tribute show to Grace Mann donates proceeds to Rappahannock Council Against Sexual Assault PERIOD  Norm Shafer University Relations

By ESTER SALGUERO

April  marked the day University of Mary Washington student Grace Mann was murdered by roommate Steven Vander Briel in an offcampus house PERIOD It was a tragic month for all members of the university PERIOD UMW students faculty and friends uphold Mann as an inspiration someone with a spirit of joy and an admirable friend who was active in supporting preventative measures toward sexual assault PERIOD

In memory of Mann Chris Kilmartin parttime solo performer and professor of psychological sciences helped raise  not including online donations for the Rappahannock Council Against Sexual Assault RCASA in memory of Grace Mann on Saturday Sept PERIOD  at Dodd Auditorium through his performance of Crimes Against Nature. manns parents matched the donations doubling the amount given when doors opened PERIOD

Mann was an executive board member of Feminists United on Campus a member of the UMW task force for sexual assault prevention and a volunteer for RCASA PERIOD In memory of Mann UMW and the members of Feminist United will continue to be active in RCASA to carry on the love that Mann displayed through her volunteer work there PERIOD

As a graduate student Kilmartin began his parttime acting career as a standup comedian winning a fewcontests and getting some extra cash until he became a part of the UMW faculty PERIOD Kilmartin won VCUs funniest person on campus contest and Richmonds funniest amateur comedian PERIOD As a part of the VCU contest awards Kilmartin also got to be in the opening act for a Budweiser Comedy Tour PERIOD

Crimes Against Nature an autobiographical solo act humorously recounted the story of Kilmartin growing up as a male in American society by explaining the social pressures young men face while growing up in a gendered society PERIOD He debuted the show in March  PERIOD

Alyssa Zanzucchi a sophomore majoring in Environmental Science thought the play was entertaining though she herself could not relate to the subject matter PERIOD It was not very relatable for me but insightful for college aged men and also entertaining to watch Zanzucchi said PERIOD

Laughter filled the auditorium as Kilmartin threw in some improvisations singling out Cedric Rucker Dean of Student Affairs when describing the masculinity portrayed in football teams PERIOD
Members of Feminist United including its president Julia Michaels sat in the second row to watch the play in Manns memory PERIOD

Kilmartin was influenced to develop this solo act after watching another solo performance artist Holly Hughes who was invited to the performance by Gregg Stull the Chair of the Department of Theatre PERIOD He defined her show as a more thoughtful and dynamic entertainment than standup comedy which spiked his interest in trying to combine his psychological studies of masculinity into a lecture that according to Kilmartin would also be a visual performance PERIOD

Gregg Stull helped Kilmartin work on the project by receiving a grant from the Funds for Excellence in order to gain inspiration and knowledge on how to set up the screen play PERIOD The very first play Kilmartin preformed in on campus was the musical Into the Woods in  PERIOD

From then on Kilmartin knew he wanted theatre to be something he would be a part of in conjunction with his role as a psychology professor PERIOD The first year Crimes Against Nature was released Kilmartin was invited to  different campuses to share his solo performance PERIOD

One reason Kilmartin wanted to share his experience in growing up as a male in American society through performing the play was to express how social pressures for men can be overwhelmingly contradictory when family friends and even girls stress the need to be masculine. when asked about gender roles in American society Kilmartin responded by explaining how damaging these ideas can be as men and women grow up trying to understand themselves PERIOD He touched on the influences media has in manipulating both sexes into believing that they are inadequate in a gendered sense PERIOD

Kilmartin also expounded on how industries are made to sell a hyper masculine version of who they are supposed to be and how supporting gender roles makes sexism a normal or accepted form of discrimination PERIOD

With these habits remaining in our society men end up engaging in a conspiracy of silence while other men degrade women PERIOD However it is not only men that make this possible PERIOD Women are also compliant in allowing masculinity to be an identity for men to hold onto PERIOD

Crimes Against Nature is a quirky autobiographical performance that sheds light on the damaging outcomes from supporting gender roles in our society and creating these social pressure for both sexes PERIOD

As Kilmartin stated it is really difficult to resist a pressure you cant name and we really arent doing a great job at naming it for men.",UMW Professor puts on one-man show in Grace Mann’s memory – The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
