The new design also features an outdoor amphitheater equipped with a stage and 1000foot screen to stream live content from the inside to the  seats outside PERIOD

Not to be too puny but it is music to the ears of the entire OSU campus Hargis said PERIOD

Current donations total  million but Hargis is confident that it wont only be OSU alumni who support the project PERIOD He claims lovers of art and culture will also help fund the project PERIOD

Among the biggest donations for the center is one from Michael and Anne Greenwood who are more recently famous for their contributions to the OSU Tennis Center PERIOD

Oklahoma State distinguished alumnus Barry Epperley also spoke of his excitement for the project PERIOD Epperley has lived in Stillwater his whole life and graduated with a degree in music education from Oklahoma State PERIOD He went on to be the Founding Director of the Performing Arts Institute at Tulsa Community College in  PERIOD

What we have really falls short of what the faculty and the students can do

Epperley said PERIOD

Epperley believes the Seretean Performing Arts Center to be too small only seating  people in its performance hall and the practice and studio rooms are too close together PERIOD

Major concerts cause students to be crowded and run together he said PERIOD

The new performing arts center will be able to offer so much more to the students  and not just in space Epperly said PERIOD

Technology is the center of the music world Epperley said PERIOD Our students need to have technology as a part of their learning and they will. there will be robotic cameras featured in the performance hall that will be able to fully capture whatever is being performed on the stage whether it be the orchestra band or play PERIOD

Lucy Bates a senior graduating in December also spoke about the opportunity the new performing arts center presented PERIOD

We know that while the Seretean has served us well we have outgrown our facilities Bates said PERIOD Future students will be able to see the performing arts center knowing that it mirrors the opportunities within and shows the excellence there. the mayor of Stillwater John Bartley is also excited at the opportunity the new project will bring PERIOD

Stillwater and OSU are integrally linked which is something I wouldnt change because we benefit each other so well Bartley said PERIOD

The music students at OSU teach many of the Stillwater youth about music PERIOD They often conduct private lessons in the Seretean which only adds to the heavy flow of traffic the Seretean produces PERIOD

Its such a natural next step to benefit the school and community Bartley said PERIOD

The current Seretean Performing Arts Center will be refurbished and given entirely to the theatre department PERIOD Andrew Kimbrough the head of OSUs theatre department will be the leader on the refurbishments PERIOD

Hargis closed ensuring students and press that OSU has a commitment towards excellence PERIOD

As weve seen with Boone Pickens and the Spears School of Business at the end of the day facilities dont transform things people do PERIOD But facilities enable people to move forward Hargis said PERIOD

A sold out gala titledA Night of Orange and Black will be held from  p.m PERIOD Thursday featuring all departments housed in the Seretean Performing Arts Center PERIOD
