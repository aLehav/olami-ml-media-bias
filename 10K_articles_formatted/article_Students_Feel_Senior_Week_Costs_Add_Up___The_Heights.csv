3722,2018-04-09,"for most Senior Week is an occasion to celebrate filled with family friends and activities PERIOD In the months and weeks leading up to commencement the Senior Week Committee plans a variety of events designed to celebrate the end of four years at BC PERIOD

While these events are open to all seniors several of them entail a price tag that is beyond the means of some PERIOD

The Senior Week website currently lists the prices for a number of but not all the events which students must pay for out of pocket PERIOD The  Days Dance which occured on Feb PERIOD  was priced at  the Dance Through the Decades Event is  not including fees the golf tournament held at Newton Commonwealth . and the Commencement Ball is . pERIOD

It is hard to imagine some people paying for these events when students are struggling to buy books said Lauren Kaufman CSOM  PERIOD People assume that BC students all come from a relatively homogenous financial background but this isnt the case as BC accepts people regardless of their financial situation. i think that the cost of senior week is definitely a hindrance for students PERIOD Students that dont have the ability to pay for senior week events are automatically denied even the possibility of experiencing these events with their senior class said Heidi Danckers MCAS  PERIOD

I think making senior week events more fiscally possible for students should be a major priority because weve all given both our tuition and our time to BC for the past four years and all seniors deserve to have the chance to close out their BC experience celebrating with their class she added PERIOD

The committee does offer several free events including Battleship water games in the Plex a Mods Relay a BCPD Barbeque and a Class of  Senior Toast PERIOD

Senior week is not a University funded program meaning the committee receives no funding from BC to put on the events said Julia Martelli one of the chairs of the senior week committee and CSOM  PERIOD The committee works extremely hard to put on a variety of events and the money brought in from any ticketed event goes directly back to paying for the cost of the event with no profit on our end. the Montserrat Coalition raffles off tickets for some of the senior week events similar to what they do for other on campus activities such as Plexapalooza PERIOD

The Senior Week Committee the planning body for the week is composed of approximately  to  students from the junior and senior classes PERIOD

Other universities employ a similar model to BC offering both free events and ones that require students to buy tickets PERIOD At Villanova University for example students pay  for the option of attending a Phillies game  for the Senior Picnic and  for the Senior Ballfor comparison Fordham Universitys Senior Ball costs  per ticket PERIOD Villanova also notes on its website that it does not profit from the week but is forced to charge for the events due to financial constraints PERIOD

Harvard University also requires students to purchase tickets to some of their senior week events PERIOD Their events including a Moonlight Cruise Senior Soire and a Last Chance Dance cost  each not including processing fees per ticket PERIOD Harvard University and Boston University also used the Royale for similarlythemed events but tickets were priced at  for Harvard and  for BU versus  for the Dance Through the Decades PERIOD

Harvard also provides aid to students through the Student Events Fund SEF designed to allow students to participate in campus activities that may pose a financial burden to them PERIOD

The SEF was created by students for students and demonstrates a commitment to removing financial barriers that might prevent a students participation in campus activities according to Harvards website PERIOD The program is made possible by scholarship dollars and is in addition to the Colleges very generous financial aid program. students at BC wish that there were ways to get involved in the events without paying the current prices such as Kaufman who suggested the idea of raffling them off PERIOD

The fact that we come from different backgrounds both socially and financially makes this campus unique so its hard to see how this portion of the BC communitys needs are being overlooked at one of the most memorable portions of their undergraduate experience Kaufman said PERIOD
