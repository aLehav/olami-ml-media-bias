Warning This review contains spoilers. in the beginning there was Luke Cage Mike Colter kicking ass and taking names PERIOD He was taking on a wellplayed and developed villain Cottonmouth Mahershala Ali with the help of the impressive Claire Temple Rosario Dawson and the fantastic detective Misty Knight Simone Missick PERIOD

Then with a major shift in plot it was all washed away PERIOD

In the seventh episode the series begins to build new plot arcs after the midseason resolutions in episode six PERIOD While every series is bound to redirect some of its focus at some point the redirection in season  of Luke Cage feels strange PERIOD Focusing on Lukes brother Willis Diamondback Striker Erik LaRay Harvey is too sudden of a change for the series leading it down a path that feels uninspired PERIOD

The show went from a dissection of the culture in Harlem and the classic battle between a reluctant hero and a wellmeaning villain to nothing more than an underserved sibling seeking revenge PERIOD I understand the motivation for a show to shift focuses midway through a season and Netflix likes to keep viewers on their toes but the way it was executed in Luke Cage had me wishing Cottonmouth had stayed as the villain PERIOD

Part of the reason this shift isnt executed as well as showrunners might have wanted are the performances PERIOD What began as genuine and believable performances by an allstar cast ended as something much more lackluster PERIOD The performances could have suffered for a multitude of reasons  directing dialogue and tone are all definite factors  but characters like Cage who started as a deep and thoughtful reflection of humanity ended as little more than a trope in a typical superhero story PERIOD

As is true for every original series Ive watched on Netflix the cinematography was beautiful PERIOD Even in moments when the content was less engaging my eyes remained glued to the screen PERIOD

The most understated but consistently fantastic part of the series was the music PERIOD Featuring artists like Raphael Saadiq and Faith Evans the series elevated its political messages with musical performances in Harlems Paradise PERIOD The only other Marvel franchise that has used music this well is Guardians of the Galaxy and for lovers of jazz and RB music Luke Cage has Marvels best soundtrack yet PERIOD

In true Marvel fashion Luke Cage created the perfect circumstances for all of the Netflix series to tie together as The Defenders. there were also plenty of fun easter eggs for fans to find throughout the episodes so even if Luke Cage isnt your favorite of the Marvel series its still definitely worth the watch PERIOD



The verdict What started as a powerful homage to Marvel Comics hero Luke Cage ended as little more than a petty fistfight PERIOD
