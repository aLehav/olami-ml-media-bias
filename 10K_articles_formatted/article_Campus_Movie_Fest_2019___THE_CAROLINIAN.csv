Campus MovieFest CMF is the largest student film festival in the entire world that tours around over  universities in the United States PERIOD Through the help of various schools as well as corporate partners CMF is able to provide free professional and high quality lighting sound and video equipment in order for students to have exceptional resources to tell their stories PERIOD UNCG students had one week from March thirteenth to the nineteenth to create and execute a short film of any genre or subject of their choice PERIOD

The  best films chosen by a jury of anonymous judges were premiered at UNCGs Cone Auditorium on Saturday March twenty-third from  to 930pm PERIOD There were two hosts of the evening who introduced themselves on stage as Maggie and Mariah and started out the evening with a group selfie to capture the moment in the spirit of film and technology PERIOD They facilitated prizes and raffles between the films throughout the evening and also engaged the audience in twitter polls PERIOD

Members of the audience won prizes varying from a  Amazon gift card to a brand new flat screen TV PERIOD A special shoutout was also given by the hosts to Amanda Rae Coslow the Program Coordinator for UNCGs Campus Activities and Programs Office CAP PERIOD Koslow stated the top film of the awards night goes on to compete at a larger festival among all of the other nation schools. uNCG has been working with CMF since  and the process includes the information session launch which is where the students get the equipment we have collection which is when the students return the equipment and then the judging process made by a secret panel of judges PERIOD Its a chance for any UNCG students to get involved whether they are a film major or if they just want to record a fun movie from on iphone and submit it to win prizes. uNCG had  student teams who created films for this festival PERIOD Although only the chosen top  were shown that evening all of the movie submissions can be found on the Campus MovieFest website PERIOD

Before showing the movies student ambassadors for Amazon Prime provided some information about Amazon Student membership and how to get signed up PERIOD Gabriela Amaro and Mohammed Hossain engaged in training in Boston before starting their ambassadorship for Prime student for UNCG PERIOD

Both Amaro and Hossain are students of the Bryan School of Business studying business administration and marketing respectively PERIOD Hosain mentioned Amazon Prime Video and CMF partnered up and so we got invited to give a speech and have an information table for this event PERIOD We have learned on hand experience with marketing as well as how to create social media ads and promotions. the genres and subjects ranged from dramas about infidelity to mockumentarystyle films about aliens around UNCG PERIOD One great aspect of this event was seeing the diversity of skills and creativity of UNCG students spanning many majors and backgrounds PERIOD

One recurring theme of the films created was self help and defeating depression PERIOD These were moving and touching stories that provided an artistic take on a common but hushed mental health issues PERIOD Atigre Farmer a UNCG junior majoring in Spanish was one of the filmmakers who won a Jury award for her film titled The Rose I Feed PERIOD

In speaking about her process Farmer states It was really stressful because Im busy during the week so I set aside one Saturday to film with my friend and edit it all that night. she stated that the main message behind her film was social justice and mental health PERIOD A lot of us deal with anxiety and depression and its really relatable PERIOD Its really a daily struggle to go through that so I wanted to relate and connect with people through this issue. farmers last message to her audience went as followed I want people to know that if they have doubts in their mind about something just put yourself through the challenge and once you get through it at least you know the process. the success of this event would not have been possible without all the collaboration and contributions of artists technicians CMF staff UNCG Campus Activities and Programs Amazon Partners and audience who supported this event PERIOD

This event held great importance in supporting students and artists through an alliance of various members of the UNCG and related communities PERIOD If youre interested in the MovieFest be sure to check out the next one
