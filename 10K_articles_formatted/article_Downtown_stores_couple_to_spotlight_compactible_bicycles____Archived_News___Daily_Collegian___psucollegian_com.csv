Freeze Thaw Cycles  S PERIOD Allen St. and ion gallery  W PERIOD Calder Way both share a love for British design  and at  tonight the two locally owned stores are teaming up to showcase their favorite U.K PERIOD designs PERIOD

The show is not focused on British brands specifically but the center of attention will be on the British bike Brompton PERIOD

Brompton is a highdesign customfolding bike that breaks down to fit into a small bag PERIOD

One of the four owners of Freeze Thaw Cycles Jordyn Drayton said the business finally started stocking Brompton parts and wanted to show them off PERIOD

Weve wanted to sell folding bikes for a long time Drayton said PERIOD It took us four years to make this decision. drayton said Brompton is not a normal bike company either because it is only one of two bicycle manufacturers in Britain and Brompton makes bikes that are built to spec for the customers. drayton said Freeze Thaw Cycles has two floor models for customers to try out but the store wont be able to buy a Brompton right away PERIOD An order will be placed through Freeze Thaw Cycles and workers will assemble the bike for customers when it arrives he added PERIOD

Drayton said it takes about four to six weeks for the bike to arrive PERIOD

The showcase is being held in ion gallery and attendees will even get the chance to test ride the Brompton bikes inside PERIOD

Drayton said Jody Harrington owner of ion gallery is a good friend of the owners of Freeze Thaw Cycles and that Harrington has a great space to hold the event PERIOD

Harrington said his space has a lot of flexibility because it is a big open space with a nice feel to it adding that the event is kindled more out of friendship and that the two owners arent doing this for a business strategy PERIOD

Harrington said the guys at Freeze Thaw Cycles know him really well and know hes gaga over English design. expressing the individuality of a Brompton bicycle Harrington compared it to a custom piece of furniture in his gallery PERIOD Harrington pointed to a chair and said It was made by the designer one at a time. during the showcase Harrington will have British artist Nick Munros line of tea coffee and barware on display to complement the U.K.themed night PERIOD

Harrington said Munro is a real bike nut himself PERIOD Harrington said Munro has kind of cheeky inspirations such as one that inspired him to cultivate an idea for a French press from an old bicycle pump PERIOD

Harrington said the next part of the equation is the people PERIOD

What makes this event special is the people it attracts he said PERIOD Theyre not seen just as customers but as aficionados for what were doing. the U.K PERIOD Night is also holding a raffle to help raise money for the Centre Region Bike Collation and Nittany Mountain Bike Association PERIOD Raffle tickets are  each and Freeze Thaw Cycles will be giving away about  of very highend bike gear Harrington said PERIOD

Elk Creek Caf and Ale Works will provide beverages but Dayton said that any age is welcome as they will be carding at the door PERIOD Harrington encourages students to not be intimidated and come join in on the fun PERIOD
