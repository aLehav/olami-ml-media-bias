507,2023-10-23,"it was a long flight back home to Salt Lake City for the Utah gymnastics team which is currently on the rebound from its first loss of the season to Pac12 rival UCLA on Saturday PERIOD

Even though each gymnast on the team could have done better to grab the win against the Bruins cohead coach Tom Farden felt that his team did the best they could against the No PERIOD 5ranked team in the country PERIOD

It was an awesome meet for our young team going against a very talented UCLA team on its home floor said Farden PERIOD We coaches are so proud of how our gymnasts responded in this environment against one of the elite teams in the country PERIOD It shows we have the confidence to go headtohead against anyone anywhere. farden feels that this loss shouldnt affect the team as hard as it is currently and ultimately hes right PERIOD Many followers of the Red Rocks this season felt that this team would be underperforming at this point in the season PERIOD With a young and mostly inexperienced team this was only to be expected PERIOD

But its been the opposite PERIOD This young Utah team is still on the cusp of a Super Six spot and has continually been able to compete with and even outdo its competitors this season PERIOD Thats something a lot of young teams in college athletics cant live up to PERIOD

The Red Rocks have developed such a great program over the years that they dont have to worry about taking a few years off to redevelop and regroup when confronted with new faces and less experience PERIOD In summary if any fan is concerned about Utahs first loss of the season they shouldnt be PERIOD

The Red Rocks will bounce back and will do it in style PERIOD It all begins after a regular break during the week until they meet their next Pac12 opponents Washington on Feb PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD in the Huntsman PERIOD So if youre a fan dont be worried about the season so far because the best is yet to come PERIOD
