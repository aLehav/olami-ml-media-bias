Speaking of random thoughts have you ever wondered who came up with the notion of morning afternoon and evening



Seriously why do we need that



In the middle of the night is actually quite early in the morning midmorning is actually only a couple of hours away from noon and afternoon actually lasts for about twelve hours but it becomes evening long before that expanse of time is over PERIOD



And who establishes exactly when afternoon becomes evening Is it at sunset or perhaps at  p.m PERIOD every day Does it change depending on where you live I looked up  in Websters Dictionary but its definition proves just as ambiguous PERIOD



The other evening or perhaps it was actually afternoon Bernice and I were discussing the concept of random thoughts PERIOD



What establishes a thought as random Ive been wondering PERIOD



Bernice claims that no thoughts are random each thought is triggered by something and while the connections arent obvious to everyone a certain order of progression does exist PERIOD



I am not entirely sure what I think about random thoughts PERIOD My brain has a nasty habit of meandering and I frequently lose sight of where I was PERIOD But I find that somehow I tend to return to my original point though I sometimes completely forget what the point was PERIOD



I am notorious amongst my comrades for my ability to tell lengthy rambling stories that cause them to roll their eyes every time I utter 



Rarely do they remember what we were discussing before I launch into another soliloquy and frequently they attach themselves to one particular event or issue in a story as the main theme when it was actually a mere sidelight PERIOD



Take for example the notorious  The actual story has long since been forgotten but the waffle has remained PERIOD For some reason the story I was telling required me to narrate the events of a particular Sunday morning at home PERIOD I mentioned that my waffle was cold by the time I actually arrived at the breakfast table that morning and made a brief treatise on why a cold waffle is never as pleasant as a warm one PERIOD



From there I returned to the story and finished a few minutes later PERIOD Once I was done everyone was staring at me waiting for me to say something more PERIOD



Being used to the blank looks that frequently follow my stories I said  About four people looking mildly frustrated and more than a little confused asked 



Since any time one of my stories becomes too detailed someone will say  The only trouble with this tactic is that invariably someone who wasnt actually in attendance for the  will ask what waffles have to do with anything PERIOD Of course this launches me into a rehashing of the  and I will forget where I was in the story that originally went awry and lose complete track of what I was talking about PERIOD



Where was I Oh yeah PERIOD Bernice says that random thoughts are necessary PERIOD If not for random thoughts we would never progress PERIOD If not for progression what would provide stimulus for random thoughts



I think that Bernice and I were allowing ourselves to be sidetracked PERIOD We had actually been discussing why silly putty is flesh colored  of course we acknowledge all the new silly putty colors out there but feel most frightened by the original PERIOD



In the midst of our musings on why silly putty is colored the way it is we began to wonder exactly how we had come to discuss our favorite  Mentally charting our conversation we discovered that before silly putty we had been discussing science experiments PERIOD It seems that Bernices younger brother Germaine had been playing with Purell and matches and had set part of the familys kitchen floor on fire PERIOD



Our discussion of the strangeness of Purell had led us into science experiments gone awry PERIOD



Before Purell we had been pondering the fire PERIOD Fire had come about because we were discussing a camping expedition a few days earlier PERIOD The camping expedition came up while we discussed the fact that we were never at all sleepy in the evening while at home but on the camping trip we were ready for bed about an hour after sunset PERIOD



Of course our musings on why our sleeping habits are so controlled by the sun came up in the midst of our discussion of the definition of evening PERIOD
