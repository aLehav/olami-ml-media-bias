Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

January  

Im curious as to why it was deemed necessary to completely redesign the Northern Star PERIOD Im a junior and for the last two years the Star has been a welcome read each morning before class PERIOD The news was short sweet and to the point Always good bits of local national and international news along with many positive articles PERIOD There were many good columns and the Weekender was unbeatable PERIOD One major thing Ive noticed is that the layout has gotten a lot more sloppy PERIOD Its hard for me scan through the paper and clearly see the articles I want to read PERIOD

Another thing I noticed is it seems the paper has started to swing to the left starting from fall semester PERIOD Now Im independent but if I were conservative it shouldnt matter either way PERIOD In the previous two years the Star was excellent at getting both sides of the political spectrum PERIOD

I liked that and it gave me much to think about PERIOD As for Flavor I know its just started but Seven ways to annoy your professor in my opinion isnt a great start PERIOD Not to mention Id rather not annoy my professor in the first place PERIOD All the ideas mentioned seemed like very surfacetype humor PERIOD Will there be any deep and interesting satiretype articles

Im pretty much the last type of person to write an email like this if you get my drift PERIOD

You know what they say if it aint broke dont fix it. daniel Nelson
