Goddess in the Doorway Mick Jagger Virgin

For his fourth solo effort one of rocks senior statesmen assembled an illustrious cast of characters to help write play produce and ultimately sell his album PERIOD Nobody talks about Mick Jaggers first three nonStones releases Shes the Boss  Primitive Cool  or Wandering Spirit  PERIOD To change that Jagger sought the help of friends old and new to put together Goddess in the Doorway PERIOD

Goddess is a mixed bag to say the least and the apparent absence of cohesion probably stems from the use of five different producers over the  song opus PERIOD The record fails to leave any sort of impression if Jaggers aim was to forge a sound tangibly distinct from anything hes done as frontman of The Rolling Stones this effort falls short PERIOD Bet your Voodoo Lounge tshirt that Goddess aint the Stones just dont bet that it will nab Mick a Grammy like recent releases from other old men Bob Dylan and Santana PERIOD

The problems begin with the allstar cameos themselves PERIOD God Gave Me Everything a heavilydistorted guitarrocker played on and produced by Lenny Kravitz is as forgettable as Kravitz himself PERIOD Jagger enlists Bono to collectively praise the Lord on the gospelinfluenced Joy a song that sounds like well a U2 song PERIOD And I still cant surmise why Jagger looked to Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to cowrite the apocalyptic Visions of Paradise. maybe its the whole SantanaGrammy thing PERIOD

Aerosmiths Joe Perry dropped by for a few takes and the results were a shake better PERIOD Everybody Getting High is straightforward powerful rock and roll with a thumping beat PERIOD Perry also plays on Too Far Gone a midtempo rocker that will do well in jukeboxes PERIOD As will Gun driven by Pete Townshends distorted lead PERIOD

The most successful collaboration on Goddess is Hide Away produced masterfully by Wyclef Jean PERIOD Wyclef lets Jaggers vocals  his strength  rise to the top over a hiphop and reggae infused arrangement of bootybass tangy electric and spicy Spanish guitar PERIOD

The real gem on Goddess though is Dont Call Me Up a ballad that features Jaggers best lyrics along with a tasteful mix of acoustic guitar and elegant piano PERIOD Jagger has always been at his best when he cries through a song PERIOD Paul McCartney cried like a girl Rod Stewart cried like a woman Jagger cries like a man  his tears come with a doubleScotch and a pack of smokes PERIOD Are there better postgirlfriendgetdrunk songs in history than Wild Horses or Angie Jagger croons Dont call me up  When some other guy  Hangs your heartstrings out to dry. why Cause I might let you down. i would like to email those lyrics to every girl I know PERIOD

When Jaggers album falters its usually because he wanders into the chasmlike genre known as adultpop an easylistening mix of string arrangements synthesizers and drummachines PERIOD Think Eric Claptons latest studio endeavors PERIOD

Boy do I miss Keith Richards PERIOD
