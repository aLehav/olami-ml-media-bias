One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Phoenix a coed secret society at the University of Michigan voted to discontinue their organization on Feb PERIOD  according to a statement by the current Phoenix class obtained by The Daily Monday PERIOD The society which formerly went by the name Adara has been in existence since  PERIOD

Senior Phoenix members usually tap students in their junior year to join the society for the upcoming academic year PERIOD This year however they voted by an overwhelming majority to forego that responsibility after months of studying the organizations history and debating its future according to the statement PERIOD

Though we make no judgments on Adara  Phoenixs past we do not believe that we have a future to play on this campus the statement reads PERIOD This decision was not taken lightly by our class nor was it made out of convenience. according to their statement AdaraPhoenix was formed after a TitleIX complaint was filed against Michigamua  now known as Order of Angell  the Universitys previously maleonly secret society PERIOD Phoenix aimed to give women leaders on campus a space for support and empowerment and was founded on principles of character achievement leadership loyalty and service according to the statement as Order did not accept female members until  PERIOD

When we were first tapped for Phoenix almost a year ago we were told that P was what we made of it the statement reads PERIOD The only purpose of our organization was to anonymously improve campus through our roles as campus leaders PERIOD We were to launch our own projects and initiatives for the improvement of the University as a whole PERIOD We were to build friendships in the process taking advantage of relationships that would otherwise not have been formed. in their statement Phoenix also urged Order and all other secret societies at the University to dissolve indefinitely PERIOD Phoenix specified that their decision was not made in connection or influenced by Orders recently publicized outreach to itsalumni regarding its future. last week The Michigan Daily obtained an email from Orders current class to the groups alumni saying that the organization is considering disbanding and has already suspended its tapping process PERIOD The email sought feedback from alumni on the role the organization plays on campus PERIOD

A group of Order alumni of color also drafted a letter on Feb PERIOD  urging the organization either permanently disband or at the very least institute a series of five reforms due to its history of appropriating Native American culture and claims of a continued hostile environment for members of color PERIOD According to the letter racebased aggression was assumed to have been limited to the past even while racialized power dynamics continued to shape the daytoday of the organization. the extent of Orders misuse of Indigenous artifacts and culture was brought to light in February  when protestors from the Students of Color Coalition occupied the seventh floor of the Union the organizations former meeting place for more than a month PERIOD According to The Dailys reporting at the time two other secret societies also met in the tower and the new Phoenix statement acknowledged that Adara was one of them PERIOD

Adara occupied the upper floors of the Michigan Unions tower alongside Michigamua in what was known as the Tower Society Phoenixs statement reads PERIOD

In  Michigamua went through a series of reforms including changing its name to Order of Angell a tribute to the Universitys former president James B PERIOD Angell PERIOD This choice has also been criticized since it went against the wishes of the Angell family and Angell himself negotiated the Angell Treaty of  that restricted Chinese immigration to the US PERIOD

In Fall  racial justice groups at the University  including the United Asian American Organizations La Casa and the Arab Student Association  released statements condemning Order and all other secret societies at the University PERIOD The Michigan Daily voted to prohibit any of its editors from joining Order or any other exclusive senior honor society on Feb PERIOD   this vote came before The Daily was aware that Order was considering disbanding PERIOD

In their statement Phoenix pointed to the cognitive dissonance that BIPOC members and potential members feel in joining their organization and discussed what they called the inherently elitist nature of all secret societies on campus PERIOD

We believe that our organizations mandate of campus leaders as a prerequisite for membership is inherently elitist the statement reads PERIOD Leadership roles are obtained through and sustained by privilege PERIOD The meaning of this phrase has never been defined PERIOD In reality each class of Phoenix is tapped by friends in previous classes compounding issues of elitism and homogeneity that have long plagued our organization. a BIPOC Phoenix member of the class of   who remains anonymous in the statement for fear of professional retribution  wrote that joining the club raised ethical concerns for them and made them question their place in the organization PERIOD

It is weird and discouraging to have to think Am I joining a racist club they wrote PERIOD It is even more unnerving to be actively told while being recruited that Phoenix is not racist PERIOD I did and still do believe that Phoenix is not a racist society PERIOD However it is modeled after one and I think that it is time to realize that distinction. suzanne Saunders Hecker a  University and Phoenix alum wrote in an email to The Daily that Phoenix alumni are deeply saddened upon learning that the current class has decided to disband the organization PERIOD

AdaraPhoenix has helped the leadership path of many underserved and underrepresented constituencies at the University of Michigan Hecker wrote PERIOD The current classes of students on campus are struggling with enormous social upheavals in our nation and world and are trying to be as responsible as possible in this environment PERIOD We respect the time and care that these seniors took in making their decision PERIOD We look forward to reflecting on our experiences within the organization PERIOD We will strive to listen and continually learn to better understand the University of Michigan students leaders and community. daily Staff Reporter Brooke Van Horne can be reached at brookevhumich.edu PERIOD
