Rep PERIOD Alexandria OcasioCortez of New York a leftwing rising progressive figure in American politics has had yet another hiccup in her inevitable lifelong political campaign PERIOD The Bronx natives Met Gala appearance might not damage future election results but it likely would taint Ms PERIOD OcasioCortezs image PERIOD

The Tax the Rich slogan seen during OcasioCortezs  Met Gala visit is a familiar concept PERIOD However evidently the hypocrisy is written all over her dress as she rubbed shoulders with some of the countrys wealthiest celebrities PERIOD This political misstep will hang over her despite the legislation she introduces PERIOD

On her website OcasioCortez sells a sweatshirt of different colors with the same slogan seen on her white gown that graced the Metropolitan Museum of Art PERIOD The unionmade symbol of expression costs  a price point that has received ridicule in the past PERIOD

Despite the overwhelming popularity in the U.S PERIOD of taxing the rich people have associated the slogan as an attempt to punish prosperity PERIOD Even the majority of registered Republicans agree to increase taxes for the extremely wealthy in society so fundamentally the motto itself isnt the problem PERIOD

Instead the selfproclaimed Democratic socialist decided to ignore principality and knowingly attended an exclusive event amongst other elites in society PERIOD

Defending her willingness to hang around beloved public figures is silly PERIOD Proud defenders of OcasioCortez cannot deny the damning image of a politician socializing with celebrities maskless when the media and others working the fundraising gala were required to wear masks PERIOD

Although the efforts to bring attention to economic reform and taxing the wealthy might be recognized by the individuals who attended there was no benefit in sharing such a provocative statement as this move was widely perceived as hypocritical and empty by the general public PERIOD The redlettered dress did nothing but create controversy in a way that harmed the message PERIOD

While wearing the dress can be viewed as an attempt to break the status quo OcasioCortezs actions are a prime example of performative politics displayed at the highest level PERIOD In a mindboggling public relations move she wore this slogan as she partied with the wealthy and elite which undoubtedly was perceived as hypocritical PERIOD

To make matters worse when OcasioCortez was invited to the Met Gala in  she skipped the event PERIOD Clearly at the time there was an understanding of how the public would perceive her surfacing at such an exclusive event PERIOD

On the night of the  Met Gala OcasioCortez clarified on an Instagram post that NYC elected officials are regularly invited to and attend the Met due to our responsibilities in overseeing our citys cultural institutions that serve the public. the lame excuse conjured by OcasioCortez does little to negate criticism of her attendance for the same reasoning was obviously not applied toward her  invitation PERIOD

However there is no denying the amount of work the 31yearold congresswoman has done in such a short time in Congress PERIOD In her first two years in the House OcasioCortez cosponsored  bills  of which were signed into law PERIOD

It is hard to imagine the people of New Yorks fourteenth district not reelecting the young progressive so her House seat is most likely secure PERIOD

OcasioCortez introduced the Green New Deal an influential piece of legislation that addresses climate change and authored the A Just Society package to modernize how the U.S PERIOD government measures poverty and makes immigrants eligible for social safety nets among other things PERIOD

Other accomplishments such as repealing the Faircloth Amendment which leads the way to solve the public housing crisis in America are why her constituents and followers will continue to stay loyal PERIOD Even if she makes the occasional blunder PERIOD

But passing legislation is only a slice of politics PERIOD At least in this country optics are just as crucial for reelection as making a meaningful impact on a community PERIOD OcasioCortez is already subject to consistent criticism from rightwing political figures PERIOD Now people from all over the spectrum are critiquing the infamous politician PERIOD

Controversy regarding OcasioCortezs Met Gala dress will be remembered as yet another mistake in her political career PERIOD

OcasioCortezs ruin will come from how bad her public image becomes the longer she remains in politics PERIOD Its still early in her political career but it is safe to say the  Met Gala will be mentioned for years to come and rightfully so PERIOD

Sorry there are no recent results for popular commented articles PERIOD
