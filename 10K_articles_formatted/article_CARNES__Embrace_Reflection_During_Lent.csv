Amid the midsemester rush of midterms and papers and the final push of so much activity before spring break Wednesday marked a turning point for the Christian community PERIOD It was Ash Wednesday the start of Lent the 40day period of prayer reflection sacrifice and almsgiving in preparation for Easter PERIOD And every year it is the bestattended day of worship in churches around the globe PERIOD

Why does this day of overt religious practice of public admission that we are sinners attract so many people Especially in our secular age and in this time when the faults of the Catholic church are on such clear display why do so many come even many who are not Catholic or Christian

I suspect it is because we find that Lent and its call to recognize the brokenness in need of healing of our world resonates with many of our most human emotions PERIOD

Unlike so many other spheres of our life  from building resumes to club applications to social media  Lent does not ask us to show only our best faces PERIOD In fact this period gives us the space to honestly gaze at our true selves and our real world PERIOD Sometimes we rightly cry at what we see PERIOD Other times we face the mystery that we are part of this complex world that is so much bigger than ourselves in both its horrors and its wonders.More than at just about any other time Lent is when we recognize the truth of sin and the righteousness of judgment PERIOD I recognize that neither of those are fashionable words today but they touch on something essential about human experience PERIOD Sin is a rupturing of our human dignity and of our responsibility to others and ourselves and our planet it injures and diminishes and it leaves us empty PERIOD We may actively choose it or we may find ourselves complicit in it PERIOD In Lent we name it for what it is and the harm that it embodies and we find strength to recommit ourselves to working to heal at least some small part of our relationships PERIOD

There is a temptation in Lent one that Christians have too often fallen into across the centuries the temptation to revel in excessive judgement and overemphasize harsh practices and even harsher judgements PERIOD To use todays language there is a temptation to cancel indiscriminately especially oneself writing off ourselves or others as hopelessly lost PERIOD

But the Scriptures proclaimed during this season describe a God who cancels no one PERIOD Lent announces a God for whom repentance and conversion is always a possibility and who is always looking for ways to repair our human fissures and faults PERIOD Indeed God reaches out with a forgiveness that far outstrips our own  so much so that it may make us profoundly uncomfortable and may even feel unjust PERIOD It invites us to sit lovingly  and I recognize how challenging that word may be  with our own brokenness and even that of others and know ourselves as beloved PERIOD

Ashes mark the beginning PERIOD They remind us of the simplicity and dignity of our origins  no better or worse than any other human being made from the same stuff as the rest of creation  and they call us to reflection PERIOD But the rest of Lent the time we live now is when we really embrace its message and experience the transformation it promises PERIOD

Over these coming  days practices of prayer and meditation ground and open us up to the transcendent meaning and message of this time PERIOD Fasting or limiting some of our consumption  perhaps by cutting back on social media or the neverending news or personal drama cycle  helps us focus on what matters most and keeps us in touch with our bodies and their need for healthy habits PERIOD And almsgiving through embracing a generosity of time and attention with those we might otherwise overlook helps us focus outside ourselves to build a more inclusive more just community PERIOD

Lent is our time to embrace honesty PERIOD We recognize the heartbreaking sin of our world and ourselves and we find hope in the neverdepleted opportunity for change and healing PERIOD We stand together incomplete but in process open to the life and wholeness for which we long.Fr PERIOD Matthew Carnes S.J. is associate professor of government and the School of Foreign Service and he currently serves as the director of the Center for Latin American Studies PERIOD As This Jesuit Sees It appears online every other Thursday PERIOD
