The sweltering  degree heat wasnt the only thing that had Moorpark Raiders fans sweating at the game against the Cerritos Falcons on Saturday PERIOD  After enduring a loss last week against Palomar the Raiders were hoping for a win PERIOD  Unfortunately Moorpark found themselves constantly backed up against their own end zone during the  blowout game against Cerritos PERIOD

Raider wide receiver Reece Smith retained his hopes for the team despite the disappointing conclusion PERIOD

We honestly came out here and we just wanted to get out and show everyone what we could do PERIOD  Of course when we come out as slow as we did it doesnt look like we are anything special said Smith PERIOD But we are something very special because we have so many athletes on this team that can do so many different things PERIOD They can give to the team a lot more that is shown in film and in stats. the crowd of a few hundred fans had to endure yellow flag after yellow flag PERIOD  With all the flag tossing one might think the referees performed for the Color Guard PERIOD With a staggering  penalties in total the Falcons accounted for  penalties totaling  yards PERIOD  The Raiders werent much better with  penalties totaling  yards PERIOD

Following last weeks loss Head Coach Mike Stuart commented Every penalty we have we run a gasser so last week we had  gassers PERIOD We had the ball in the red zone twice and we didnt execute PERIOD  One time we did score but we need to get down there more and get the ball into the end zone. a little explanation for the untrained  A gasser is running the width of the football field four consecutive times PERIOD  Start on one sideline and sprint to the opposite sideline touch the sideline and immediately sprint back to the starting line PERIOD  With a standard football field measuring  yards wide one full gasser covers  yards PERIOD  Obviously the Raiders will have their fair share of gassers this week PERIOD  No one envies the players who have to run  yards in the upcoming heat PERIOD

We werent executing very well PERIOD  We were letting small things get in our heads and we werent really doing our jobs said Smith We tried to but we werent doing it as well as we should have. though at one point in the game Moorpark had  penalties backtoback the Raiders moral was boosted after a  yard touchdown from freshman wide receiver Blake Batarse PERIOD

Coach Stu and Coach Turner put me in the right position to make that play said Batarse and my team and I just made it happen. the game wasnt all bad PERIOD  Despite being down  points in the fourth quarter the Raiders did not give up and scored  points while the Falcons only scored  PERIOD  But this wasnt enough for the Raiders to come back as they were defeated  PERIOD

The scoreboard does not show what Moorpark is all about preached running back Edyon Batta I think we let a lot of things go and a lot of penalties in the beginning and we started slow PERIOD We gotta go hard on Monday PERIOD We gotta come together as a team more. the Raiders will host their first home game against  Glendale College PERIOD  Glendale experienced a recent loss to Pasadena City  giving high hopes that Moorpark will pull a win for their first home game PERIOD
