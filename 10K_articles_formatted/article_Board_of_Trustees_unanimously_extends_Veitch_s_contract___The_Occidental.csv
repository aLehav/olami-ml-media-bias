5466,2022-03-16,"after a twoyear assessment of President Jonathan Veitchs tenure as president the Board of Trustees announced its unanimous decision to extend his contract through  PERIOD

The boards assessment reviewed several factors in its decision to extend Veitchs contract namely his execution of the strategic plan his recruitment of both students and faculty and his extensive work in raising more money for the college and its initiatives PERIOD

The Board of Trustees also took into account Veitchs handling of sexual assaults on campus which has concerned students and alumni alike PERIOD Despite the criticism Chairman Chris Calkins  said Veitchs leadership has made Occidental a pioneer in developing stronger policies against sexual assault PERIOD

Occidental ended up being in a leadership position in trying to aggressively address sexual assault in the whole issue of misbehavior on campus Calkins said PERIOD We are leading the way in solutions even if it doesnt feel fast enough for people PERIOD We are clearly ahead of many colleges and universities. looking back on his time so far Veitch said one of his biggest accomplishments was reestablishing effective leadership PERIOD

When I first came the biggest challenge was to reestablish connections and we did that with the addition to Swan Hall and the new fitness center which we converted from the alumni gym just to show people that we could get things done Veitch said PERIOD

Now that his contract has been extended by six years Veitch wants to focus on expanding the urban  component of the strategic plan PERIOD His initiatives include developing connections with major cultural institutions establishing internship opportunities with nonprofits and other businesses and developing civic engagement PERIOD

The formal process of assessing Veitchs leadership began in the  schoolyear PERIOD The Board of Trustees specifically the executive committee headed by Calkins was the sole party involved in deciding how to evaluate the president PERIOD

According to Faculty Council President Nalsey Tinberg faculty members were not consulted in the process PERIOD She did note that the announcement of his contract extension to students was new this year PERIOD

Calkins said the importance of his contract renewal warranted a campuswide announcement PERIOD

We believe it was important for the community to know that the presidents leadership would continue Calkins said via email PERIOD The event provided an opportunity to emphasize the direction of the college and its continuing commitment to excellence and diversity in all areas. the college had over five presidents between  and  when the Board of Trustees hired Veitch PERIOD According to Calkins Veitchs continued employment is especially beneficial to the college as an institution to those who work here and to the students who will attend the college in the future PERIOD

One of the great advantages of having a president who will stay for an extended period is the opportunity to really develop long term relationships and to carry a consistent message both about what the institution wants to accomplish and the leadership for all those within the institution Calkins said PERIOD

Veitch took into account this aspect of his job when he considered his contract extension PERIOD

These schools absolutely benefit from longevity Veitch said PERIOD  When you have turnover in the presidents office and its happened in Occidentals past it means in terms of fundraising starting over relationships all over again PERIOD It means the college not having a clear direction for a while until a new person is in place and learns the ropes. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD",Board of Trustees unanimously extends Veitch's contract - The Occidental,Occidental College
