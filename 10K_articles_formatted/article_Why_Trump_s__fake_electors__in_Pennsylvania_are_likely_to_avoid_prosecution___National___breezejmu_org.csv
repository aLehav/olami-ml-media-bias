An elector for President Joe Biden fills out their ballot in Harrisburg in December  PERIOD

This article is made possible throughSpotlight PAs collaboration withVotebeat a nonpartisan news organization covering local election administration and voting PERIOD This article is available for reprint under the terms ofVotebeats republishing policy PERIOD

Sixteen people in Michigan who served as socalled  for Donald Trump are nowfacing statelevel forgery charges but similar prosecution appears unlikely here in Pennsylvania as the investigation into an alleged plot to overturn the  election ramps up PERIOD

The Keystone State was one of seven won by President Joe Biden where groups of people gathered to submit votes for Trump instead PERIOD The plan to organize those electors is part of a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Jack Smith which appears to be nearing criminal charges PERIOD Prosecutors inArizonaandGeorgia two states with false electors are also investigating the plan PERIOD

But unlike Michigan Pennsylvanias alternate electors are unlikely to face criminal repercussions because of an important legal caveat they added to their document PERIOD

The term fake electors arose in the post2020 election period when in some states Biden had won electors for Trump cast electoral votes despite Trumps loss and then submitted their certificate of votes to Congress as well PERIOD Through investigations such as Congresss select committee to investigate the Jan PERIOD  attack fake electors false electors and alternate electors have come to represent the Trump allies who signed their name to those certificates PERIOD

Heres what to know about Pennsylvanias fake electors PERIOD

In the United States presidential election system each state is represented by a certain number of electors based on its population PERIOD Electors arecitizens of the state whose vote determines who wins the presidency PERIOD In  Pennsylvania had  electoral votes PERIOD

Each presidential nominee selects a slate of electors before the general election PERIOD Once the winner of the states popular vote is determinedthe governor authorizes that candidates slateto cast their votes in the electoral college except in two states Nebraska and Maine whichaward their electoral votes proportionally PERIOD The electors then submit a certificate of their votes to Congress which accepts and counts those electoral votes on Jan PERIOD  of the year following the presidential election PERIOD A presidential candidate needs  or more electoral votes to win PERIOD

READ MORE ABOUT PENNSYLVANIAS ELECTORAL PROCESS

Because Joe Biden won the popular vote in Pennsylvania Congress counted the states electoral votes for him PERIOD

Pennsylvanias slate of alternate Trump electors featured20 prominent Republicansfrom across the state PERIOD Among them were former U.S PERIOD congressman and gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta Allegheny County Council member Sam DeMarco state GOP Vice Chairwoman Bernadette Comfort and Kevin Harley a former spokesperson for Gov PERIOD Tom Corbett PERIOD

A copy of the certificate which lists all of the electors names was obtained bythe government watchdog group American Oversightshown on Page  of the collected documents PERIOD

According to reporting from the New York Times and other news organizations as well as Votebeat and Spotlight PA interviews with participants the plan to convene alternate electors was organized by the Trump campaign PERIOD

Lawyers for the campaign including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed a point person in each state to help organize the fake electorsaccording to the New York Times PERIOD In Pennsylvania that person was state Sen PERIOD Doug Mastriano who reportedly needed assurances that the plan was legal PERIOD

However two of the electors Sam DeMarcoandCharlie Gerow said they mainly interacted withTrump attorney James Fitzpatrick PERIOD

On Dec PERIOD  the fake electors met in the offices of Quantum Communications  Gerows Harrisburgbased public affairs firm  to cast their votes for Trump PERIOD Pennsylvania law requires that the electors meet in the state capital PERIOD Bidens electors also met in Harrisburg to cast their votes on this day PERIOD

Simultaneously Trump had been personally contacting then speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Bryan Cutler and asking him what could be done to fix the election issues Trump was hearing about in Pennsylvania PERIOD

Cutleraccording to the Washington Post told Trump the legislature had no power to overturn the states popularly chosen slate of electors meaning Bidens electors PERIOD

Unlike in other states Pennsylvanias fake electors added an important caveat to the certificate that likely shielded them from the consequences faced by their counterparts in Michigan PERIOD

Pennsylvanias certificate said the votes they were casting should only be counted if a court found that they were the duly elected and qualified Electors. the reasoning that we were given for the need to go through with this process was that the campaign was concerned that there was a number of court cases that the Trump campaign had not adjudicated yet DeMarco said and the campaign hoped a favorable ruling for Trump in those cases might have changed the outcome of the vote PERIOD In that scenario DeMarco added the campaign was concerned that if there was no slate of electors submitted under the constitutional process the court victories would be meaningless PERIOD

So I as well as others said Fine but lets make the document reflect that  he said PERIOD So were a bit different from the other folks. nevadas fake electors included similar language in their certificate PERIOD

The fake electors certificate in Michigan where they were recently charged with forgery and other related crimes included no such caveat PERIOD

Gerow echoed DeMarcos remarks that the concern among the electors was that they would be viewed as trying to put themselves forward as the legitimately appointed electors PERIOD

But rather we were the placeholders in case any court found that the Biden slate that claimed to be the legitimate slate was not he said PERIOD Ive been a lawyer for almost  years and I think what we did was totally appropriate. still many of Trumps legal argumentshad been settled by Dec PERIOD  PERIOD Many of the original Trump electors like Pennsylvania GOP chairman Lawrence Tabas also declined to sign the certificate either due to concerns over legality or because they recognized Biden as the legitimate winner according to thefinal report of Congresss January  committee PERIOD

Kevin Greenberg a Philadelphiabased attorney who has represented national Democratic clients including in  agreed that the caveat on the courts was an important distinction that set Pennsylvania and Nevada apart PERIOD He said in unusual situations likeHawaii in 1960orFlorida in  situations where there was in fact a bona fide dispute about the results  a second conditional slate may theoretically be appropriate PERIOD

I understand proactively voting your electors in a truly disputed situation but always with a crystal clear statement that your actions are not representations of victory but only a prophylactic measure in case a court action finally goes your way he said PERIOD Thats why I expect Pennsylvania will not have the criminal prosecutions we are seeing elsewhere. in Pennsylvania the problem is not what these electors did but what others did with this alternate slate  they made vastly more of it than it was he said PERIOD

Greenberg noted that some members of Congress voted against accepting Bidens electors because the alternate slates had submitted votes for Trump and other Trump allies used them as part of the pressure campaign aimed at getting thenVice President Pence to do the same even in the case of the Pennsylvania slates conditional votes PERIOD

Neither DeMarco or Gerow said they were worried about any criminal repercussions and both pointed out that even Gov PERIOD Josh Shapiro a Democrat agreed with them PERIOD

In early  Shapiro then attorney general said the Pennsylvania fake electors actions did not cross the line into criminality PERIOD

These fake ballots included a conditional clause that they were only to be used if a court overturned the results in Pennsylvania which did not happenShapiro said.Though their rhetoric and policy were intentionally misleading and purposefully damaging to our democracy based on our initial review our office does not believe this meets the legal standards for forgery. a spokesperson for current Attorney General Michelle Henry said this month that position has not changed PERIOD

The detail behind how Pennsylvanias electors came together may still be of interest to federal investigators weighing criminal charges for Trump PERIOD Trump recently revealed that he received a target letter from Smith indicating that criminal charges may be coming soon PERIOD

Criminal charges may also becoming soon in Georgia PERIOD

DeMarco has been open about his contact with FBI agents last spring with whom he said he fully cooperated PERIOD Asked if he has been in contact with Smiths investigators since he was appointed as special counsel last November DeMarco replied only with no comment. gerow said neither he nor Kevin Harley another member of his firm and a fellow alternate elector have had contact with any investigators PERIOD
