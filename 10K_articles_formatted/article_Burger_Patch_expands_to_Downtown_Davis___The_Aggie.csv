New burger restaurant makes additional plantbased alternatives accessible to Davis community

In an era of increasingly popular health fads coupled with the growing importance of environmental awareness veganism and plantbased diets are becoming more common and research continues to show both the health and environmental benefits these diets have PERIOD And soon Burger Patch will bring what founder Phil Horn calls convenient consciousness to Davis PERIOD

Burger Patch a completely plantbased burger restaurant with locations in Downtown Sacramento and the Golden  Center will expand to Davis in early  in Davis Commons at  first St. just a short walk from campus PERIOD The establishments opening will be facilitated by founders Phil and Danea Horn PERIOD

Burger Patch hopes to encourage students to explore the plantbased lifestyle PERIOD In addition to providing convenient plantbased alternatives CoFounder Phil Horn explained that the team loves being a part of the late night scene in Sacramento and said he hopes we can do that in Davis. on Friday and Saturday nights Burger Patch stays open until  a.m PERIOD and offers classic late night snacks like burgers shakes and fries with plantbased twists PERIOD The owners also hope to serve breakfast at the new Davis location PERIOD

The plantbased lifestyle is quickly gaining popularity PERIOD According to Liz Applegate a distinguished senior lecturer in the nutrition department and former director of sports nutrition at UC Davis there are countless upsides to adopting more plantbased meals into ones diet PERIOD

When you choose a diet thats based in more fruits and vegetables and beans and other unprocessed plant products you get more fiber and more phytonutrients that reduce the risk of a variety of chronic diseases including heart disease cancer and developing typetwo diabetes Applegate says PERIOD

She did caution that consuming a plantbased burger does not mean its better for you. if I were to go to InNOut and get a burger and fries and a shake or if I was to go to Burger Patch and get their standard burger fries and shake they have relatively the same nutrition profile Applegate said PERIOD

Applegate urges people to recognize that Burger Patch should not be considered diet food and that it is not a reflection of the plantbased diet as a whole PERIOD The plantbased diet is made up of many fruits vegetables and legumes and Applegate said it is great for reducing longterm health problems and said reducing meat consumption is an allaround healthy choice PERIOD

Beyond the health benefits of a plantbased diet there is also a positive impact on the environment PERIOD Phil Horn explained that the environmental impact of creating beyond meat versus ground beef differs phenomenally PERIOD

The stats are numerous in terms of the amount of CO2 emissions and the amount of water it takes to make a meat burger versus eating a nonmeat alternative Horn said PERIOD One cow for instance takes hundreds of thousands of gallons of water to create food on your plate PERIOD Using a meat alternative is a fraction of that. burger Patch strives to increase restaurant sustainability a goal that contributes to their overall mission one that Horn said boils down to kindness PERIOD This is visible in terms of kindness toward animals the environment and people PERIOD

Burger Patch also has a grilpower initiative which states that the restaurant will strive to have at least  representation of men and women in positions of power such as team leads key holders and managers by the end of  PERIOD Horn also explained the restaurants commitment to a monthly Patch Match. every month we select a nonprofit in the local area and we give back a portion of every burger sold in addition to doing one night when we give  of all sales to the organization Horn said PERIOD

Burger Patch will open its doors in early  and Horn urged students and community members alike to stop by and try his personal favorite burger The total patch a beyond burger patty our chicken alternative and our bacon alternative all on one burger PERIOD Its amazing
