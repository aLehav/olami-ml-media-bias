For as much as it seems Josh Funk wants to be a rock star his vacant crowd gave every indication there was some work to be done PERIOD

Funk and his band put on a free show Wednesday in the Free Speech Area as part of the A.S PERIOD Presents Nooner Concert series PERIOD The mindnumbing set which included long unnecessary pauses between songs muffled lyrics technical difficulties and an overall lack of enthusiasm did not do much to encourage students passing by to stop tolisten PERIOD

My friends are gonna play some songs for you guys Funk said PERIOD

Although his introduction barely drew a peep let alone any indication anyone nearby was paying attention the band dove into its first song PERIOD If not for the free rockclimbing wall set up by the stage or the pesky students passing out Rec Center voting propaganda the band would have been playing for its own amusement PERIOD

Funk proceeded to spend more time talking about rock climbing and voting than he did preparing to play and it showed PERIOD Whether it was unintelligible lyrics or microphones that didnt work Funk and his band sludged through a set and covered topics ranging from love life making money and selling out PERIOD

This next one is called studying your smile and its for Laura he said PERIOD

If anyone paying attention wasnt already unconscious this song definitely put them to sleep PERIOD The song was typical of a cheesy love song as it included tired lyrics about a girl coupled with a dulldrum melody PERIOD

The band followed with a more fastpaced song entitled Implode but technical difficulties did not do the song any justice PERIOD

The mics not working Funk said PERIOD Were gonna have to do this the oldfashion ghetto way PERIOD

Funk started a song and then stopped and prepared to skip it because of some setback PERIOD He said it wasnt a good song but after the problem was fixed he decided to play it anyway PERIOD Despite giving notice of the song not being good the audience probably could have figured it out on its own PERIOD

At one point Funk rambled on about being a rock star and how one should pose if they were to become one PERIOD

If youre gonna be a rock star you gotta do the rock star stance he said while giving his best imitation PERIOD

The final song of the afternoon came not a moment too soon as Funk led his group through a song about getting all the chicks once he becomes rich and famous PERIOD

Judging by the audiences lack of reaction his playing on this day did nothing to help achieve this goal but at least showed Funk has something to work for PERIOD
