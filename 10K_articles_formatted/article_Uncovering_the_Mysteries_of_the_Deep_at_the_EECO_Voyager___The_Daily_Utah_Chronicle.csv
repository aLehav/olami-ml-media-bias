Ever since the first appearance of the strange futuristic structure outside of the Loveland Living Planet Aquarium guests have observed it with curiosity and confusion PERIOD The structure was originally used as the stage for U2s worldwide  tour which lasted two full years PERIOD It was purchased in July  by the aquarium to live out the rest of its days as the Ecosystem Exploration Craft  Observatory also known as the EECO Voyager PERIOD

Underneath the stage at the EECO Voyager is a stateoftheart virtual reality VR experience that takes guests under the sea and through rainforests PERIOD In terms of first impressions the atmosphere was perfect PERIOD Everything felt very futuristic technological and professional PERIOD It was as if I were about to go on a research expedition PERIOD The fact that the staff inside were dressed like Star Trek crew members definitely elevated this feeling PERIOD

There are two options in terms of experience PERIOD One is the Ocean Explorer where guests can expect to have close encounters with fish sea turtles an octopus and even great white sharks PERIOD The other is the rainforest in which guests fly through the air with fruit bats crawl on the ground with a tarantula and are sniffed out by a jaguar PERIOD

There weretimes particularly with the tarantula and the sharks when the effect was immersive as a whole PERIOD However with the way the footage was captured there were also times when the environment felt more 2D than others PERIOD This doesnt take away from the overall experience though as the chairs move with the footage there are smells pumped into the room and bursts of air at your feet to mimic environment changes PERIOD

Informational bulletins pop up whenever a new creature is introduced including the average size weight habitat and some interesting facts about said animal PERIOD This is a recurring theme not just through the experiences but with the aquarium as a whole PERIOD Their mission is to inspire people to explore discover and learn about Earths diverse ecosystems and they do just that PERIOD

At the end of the Ocean Explorer guests are taken to a barren section of the Coral Triangle PERIOD The Coral Triangle is a tropical area around the northern part of Oceana that contains hundreds of coral species many of which are endangered thanks to coral bleaching PERIOD Through VR visitors are taken to a coral nursery in which marine biologists from the Living Planet Aquarium are collaborating with scientists from around the world to regrow the Triangles coral population PERIOD

Having an aquarium in a landlocked state has been a controversial topic for years among Utahns according to Associate Director of Marketing and Public Relations Karmel Harper PERIOD However she stresses the importance of having an aquarium in the middle of a desert PERIOD She wants people to be educated on how they can do their part to save sea life despite being thousands of miles away from the closest ocean PERIOD

The Living Planet Aquarium is a nonprofit organization and relies on donations and ticket purchases to expand its educational programs and animal care PERIOD It is AZA Accredited something less than  of animal exhibitors have achieved meaning its one of the most trustworthy and wellkept aquariums in the country PERIOD

I asked Harper at the end of our visit if there was anything she wanted college students to know about the Living Planet Aquarium PERIOD Come and learn she said PERIOD Our mission is to educate. emailprotected
