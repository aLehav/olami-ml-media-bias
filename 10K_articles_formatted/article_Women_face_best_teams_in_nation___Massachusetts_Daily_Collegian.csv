Spring break in Florida to most UMass students means long days on the beach and plenty of fun sun and partying PERIOD But for the Massachusetts womens tennis team next weeks trip to Florida will be a more serious journey as it faces its tough competition of the year and looks to get back on track on the spring campaign PERIOD

The Maroon and White will be traveling to Boca Raton for four matches over spring break against some of the nations most fierce womens tennis programs PERIOD However head coach Judy Dixon and her warriors are not making the excursion with winning as their top priority PERIOD

We have two goals in mind going down there Dixon said PERIOD Number one is to get ready for the outdoor season and number two is trying to play the best competition that is readily available. the Minutewomen will be greeted by Lynn University for their first match and it will take a Hingisesque performance to overtake the hosts PERIOD The Fighting Knights come into the match ranked No PERIOD  in Division II with an extremely impressive  record on the year PERIOD

The week wont get any easier as Wednesday will bring Florida Atlantic to the Maroon and Whites table PERIOD The Owls will probably present an even bigger roadblock to UMass as they currently hold the No PERIOD  ranking in Div PERIOD I PERIOD  The Minutewomen will also take on St PERIOD Thomas University and Broward Community College on the trip PERIOD

Lynn and Florida Atlantic are completely out of our league but we play them so we can play the best of the best Dixon said PERIOD

The team has been eager to get back to the courts as it will have been idle for nearly a month before taking on Lynn its last match being the disappointing showing against Army on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD With the Maroon and Whites last showdown against Harvard cancelled due to inclement weather getting back on the courts will be somewhat of a relief to the women PERIOD

I think this trip is something that we really need Dixon said PERIOD Weve been dealing with injury and illness as well as not having anyone to play PERIOD You want to reprove yourself but if theres nobody to play then youre stuck with that old feeling again. fortunately for the Minutewomen should they lose any matches on the Florida trip it will only affect their dual match play record and not their standings in the ECAC as they look to gain an invite to the ECAC Tournament next year PERIOD

However one sour note for the Maroon and White is the loss of junior Annie Hamilton who will be unable to make the trip due to a knee injury PERIOD Hamilton had been a solid member of the squad but will be going back to Texas to rehabilitate instead of traveling to Florida PERIOD

Nevertheless the Minutewomen amidst the sunshine and beaches will be looking to regain the focus and stellar play that accompanied their fall season by taking on what Dixon calls an outside enemy PERIOD  The spring break journey will hopefully rejuvenate the Maroon and White from its period of inactivity and jumpstart its trip to the top of the Atlantic  PERIOD
