Gerald Saxon

In midSeptember Gerald Saxon announced that he will be stepping down as the dean of libraries PERIOD

He always has a welcoming demeanor and has overseen the growth of the Texas Map Society the Garrett Lectures and Special Collections said Ben Huseman Cartographic Archivist PERIOD

Although he is stepping down Saxon will continue to hold his position as a professor of history and oral history methods after taking a years leave for research PERIOD

Since September no developments have been publicized about how the university was progressing in its search to fill the void that Saxons departure will create PERIOD

The nature of the search is in itself confidential said Julie Alexander associate Library Director PERIOD

After Dr PERIOD Saxons departure announcement a search committee was formed to issue a public announcement across the country to fill the position PERIOD

After Saxons announcement the committee sent out a public advertisement  a document that petitions the public for a new dean with basic credentials such as a PhD and library managing experience PERIOD

David J PERIOD Silva chairman of the search committee and Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs said since that advertisement the committee has received a number of appeals and applications PERIOD They began reviewing them on January  PERIOD

The typical search offers three cuts Silva said PERIOD In the first cut we look at each candidate and their credentials PERIOD Based on the most ideal candidates we then narrow it down to somewhere between seven and ten people whom we contact for an interview via Skype or telephone PERIOD Then based on the strength of that interview we then make a short list of a few people whom we invite to campus for two or three days to meet with relevant constituencies. at this time the committee is still in the first stage of cuts PERIOD

Its rare to find the perfect ideal candidatebut its not impossible Silva said PERIOD What were looking for at the very least is the optimal candidate. according to Silva a candidate might be drawn to the university because budget cuts arent as substantial. for instance higher education in California coerced  fulltime equivalent positions into taking furloughs or a leave of absence in order to achieve payroll savings PERIOD

Alexander said she is confident that the committee will find a new dean in good time PERIOD

In the worst case scenario the provost would have to appoint an interim dean but there should be plenty of time between the committees appeal and Dr PERIOD Saxons step down she said PERIOD
