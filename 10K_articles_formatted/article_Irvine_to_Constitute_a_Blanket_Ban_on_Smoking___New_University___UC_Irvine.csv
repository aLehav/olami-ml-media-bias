Following in the footsteps of Orange County cities Laguna Beach and Dana Point Irvine is proposing a smoking ban on all public property PERIOD

The state of California has already passed a law that bans smoking in state parks and beaches but cities like Laguna Beach and Dana Point have taken a step further and banned smoking in all public spaces PERIOD These public spaces include public sidewalks alleyways and parking lots PERIOD With the new bill the city of Irvine will take a step in the same direction PERIOD

Councilmember Farrah Khan and Mayor Pro Tem Anthony Kuo have both stated that they intend this ban to create a healthier environment for a more responsible community PERIOD

Unlike Irvines previous  smoking ban on cigarettes the proposal discusses how the ban will include ecigarettes and a stricter domain for smoking areas PERIOD This is in part to increased research on the health effects of smoking and of secondhand smoke PERIOD

When I sat with the city attorney we saw the current regulation was lacking the substance needed today especially with lots in the news about smoking and all the data we have now about secondhand smoke is tremendous Khan said PERIOD

Irvine was given an F rating in  by the American Lung Association PERIOD The city of Dana Point was given a higher grade of C thus predicting where Irvine will stand with the bills passing PERIOD In addition there have been around  cases of ecigarette use associated with lung injury as of Oct PERIOD  throughout the U.S PERIOD

The bills reading originally scheduled for Oct PERIOD  was postponed to Oct PERIOD  after confusion about the clear distinction between public and private property PERIOD

The new bill blocks residents from smoking nearly anywhere besides their private residence with the addition of streets parking lots common rooms businesses and bike paths as nonsmoking areas. public smoking will be fined but Councilmember Khan stated we do have fines in place But the goal isnt to have police looking out for people but educating the community. rather than having police actively enforcing the law Khan hopes that Irvine residents will learn how to regulate their smoking PERIOD

According to Khan the bill could be made law as soon as late November PERIOD
