Wubba lubba dub dub PERIOD Rick and Morty is back at long last after a hiatus that seemed to go on forever and ever  years PERIOD If you arent sure what Rick and Morty is or why its one of the best things currently on television then you need to go get a Hulu account right now and stream the first two seasons then come back and read this spoilerfilled review of season three episode one PERIOD Seriously Ill wait PERIOD Done Awesome lets get into it PERIOD

On April Fools Day creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon released the first episode of the longawaited season three PERIOD The episode is called The Rickshank Rickdemption and at the time of this writing before any copyright claims take fire you can find it plastered all over YouTube for free PERIOD

At the end of season two Rick turned himself into the Galactic Federation so that his family wouldnt have to hide out with him forever on a comically tiny planet PERIOD It was an utterly depressing cliffhanger to end on and ever since then fans have been speculating as to how the drunk old genius would bust out of prison PERIOD

The Rickshank Rickdemption answers that question although it throws plenty of fakeout moments on its way there PERIOD

The episode opens with Rick Morty Summer Beth and Jerry sitting pleasantly in a booth at Shoneys as if nothing has happened PERIOD Of course Rick figures out fairly quickly that this is an illusion and so a Nathan Fillionvoiced alien reveals himself and tells Rick that they will fry his brain unless they get Ricks secrets to interdimensional travel PERIOD Nathan Fillion a god of nerd culture is solid in this guest role PERIOD

Rick begrudgingly agrees to show the alien the day that he invented his portal gun although not without first stopping for a great bit at a  McDonalds to get some of that sweet promotional Mulan Szechuan dipping sauce and the two stand and watch as the younger bluepants wearing Rick finishes his successful test of the gun PERIOD

Unfortunately younger Ricks scientific triumph leads to the death of his wife and daughter which eventually turns him into the sociopath alcoholic we all know and love PERIOD Except not really  this entire scene was fabricated so that Rick could hack into the aliens cognitive machinery and escape from prison taking over the minds of his alien friends and overturning their government in the process PERIOD He then goes off to destroy the government of alternate Ricks running into Morty and Summer along the way PERIOD

Throughout the episode we also caught glimpses of Morty Summer Beth and Jerry living their new lives on Earth under control of the Galactic Federation PERIOD Jerry is the only one who enjoys this new life with all of the others drowning out their depression in Federationmandated pills PERIOD

Summer becomes obsessed with rescuing Rick but Morty has become disillusioned with his grandpa claiming that Rick doesnt care about them and showing Summer some of the foul remnants of his adventures with the old man PERIOD It was interesting to see Morty whose primary character traits have been his weakness and stupidity mature into someone who thinks for himself and realizes the consequences of his grandpas actions PERIOD This could potentially provide an intriguing dynamic for the remainder of the season PERIOD

Morty and Summer eventually end up at the Citadel of Ricks where they run into their Rick PERIOD In a moment of frustration in which Summer is being held hostage and Rick threatens to shoot her to get to the lead Citadel Rick Morty shoots Rick not knowing that Rick had given him a fake gun so that in the fakeout moment the lead Citadel Rick could be taken out PERIOD The episode ends with the Federation being dismantled and leaving Earth Rick and the kids returning home and Beth and Jerry finally agreeing to divorce PERIOD

All seems well and good until Rick and Morty get a minute alone in the garage in a scene that parallels the end of the pilot episode PERIOD Its here that Rick reveals his evil plan  his whole reason for getting captured by the Federation was not to simply dismantle it but also to bring Beth and Jerry to an ultimatum so that Jerry would be out of the picture and Rick would become the de facto patriarch of the family PERIOD

He also reveals that the only reason he saved Morty and Summer was so that he would be welcomed back as a hero by Beth PERIOD He states that his ultimate goal even if it takes nine seasons is to get more of that sweet Szechuan McNugget dipping sauce and that the upcoming season will have the darkest adventures yet PERIOD

It seems like a weird slap in the face to fans for Roiland and Harmon to build up Rick as a sympathetic character throughout season two only to have him become a complete monster in this episode however I am sure this development will lead to some hilarious and dramatic plotlines down the road PERIOD In addition this show has always loved shocking its audience so it should be no surprise that Roiland and Harmon are toying with our emotions yet again PERIOD

This was a truly concerning end to an overall fantastic season opener PERIOD Is Rick genuinely a sociopath who cares nothing for his family Was Mortys fakeout killing of Rick a sign of their degrading relationship Did the blue pants mean anything Was this episode even canonical or merely an April Fools joke

Most importantly will Rick ever get some of that sweet Szechuan McNugget sauce I dont know but I cant wait to find out PERIOD This episode was filled with the fastpaced wit awesome adventures and brilliant animations that fans have come to expect and I cant wait to see what Roiland and Harmon still have in store PERIOD I give The Rickshank Rickdemption five out of five Mr PERIOD Meeseekses PERIOD Burp PERIOD
