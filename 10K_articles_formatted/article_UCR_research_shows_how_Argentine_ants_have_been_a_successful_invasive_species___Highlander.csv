7841,2018-02-05,"a recent UCR research paper Verification of Argentine Ant Defensive Compounds and Their Behavioral Effects on Heterospecific Competitors and Conspecific Nestmates explores how Argentine ants have been able to fight against other ants and become a successful invasive species PERIOD The research was conducted for about three years by UCR Entomology Assistant Cooperative Extension Specialist and Assistant Professor Dr PERIOD DongHwan Choe US Department of Agriculture USDA chemist Kamlesh Chauhan All Things Bugs founder Aaron Dossey Shao Hung Lee Dennis and Ph.D student Kevin Welzel PERIOD

Argentine ants are hypothesized to have been introduced by intercontinental trade PERIOD These species of ants have existed in California particularly Southern California for more than  years where they cause problems ranging from urban infestations to agricultural concerns such as threatening citrus orchards PERIOD

Argentine ants have been a concern to citrus orchards due to their mutualistic relationship with citrus orchard pests PERIOD The citrus pests create a sugary waste called honeydew which when deposited on the citrus leaves form sooty mold PERIOD The ants then consume some of the honeydew and in return protect the pests PERIOD

As a result from that protection pest population grows to high levels said Dr PERIOD Matthew Daugherty agriculture extension specialist and principal investigator in the UCR Department of Entomology PERIOD

The Argentine ants were analyzed on a hypothesis formed through previous researchers observations of ant behavior PERIOD Argentine ants were observed raising their abdomen to face a competing ant who would suddenly become irritated and disoriented PERIOD Based on this behavior it was hypothesized that the competing ants were affected by the Argentine ants excreting two compounds called dolichodial and iridomyrmex from their abdomen PERIOD The research tested this hypothesis by placing different species of ants with Argentine ants PERIOD Once we saw the Argentine ant was behaving aggressively towards the other ants we would take a sample from the air scene explained Lee PERIOD

The researchers hope to use this new information to better improve insecticides PERIOD The goal is to modify these two compounds to create an insecticide that attracts the Argentine ants while repelling native ants PERIOD Currently the use of sugary baits which contain  percent sugar solution and . percent of pesticide are used to control the Argentine ant population PERIOD The ants drink the bait but since there is a low amount of pesticide present it does not kill them instantly PERIOD This gives the ants time to bring the poison back to the queen inside the colony PERIOD However this method not only reduces the population of the invasive species but unintentionally affects the native species as well PERIOD

New suggested alternative controls include the introduction of phorid flies PERIOD These flies drill into an ants neck depositing eggs which hatch becoming maggots that consume the ants brain PERIOD However using the information gained in the research project the Argentine ants own biology could be used to control their own population PERIOD

While Dr PERIOD Choe does not currently have any future research on Argentine ants in progress Choe will continue to study Argentine ants and other ants since the ant diversity in Riverside and other parts of southern California is slowly changing due to biological or environmental factors PERIOD
