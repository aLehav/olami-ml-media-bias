What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is an inspiring read PERIOD

Adam Coil Life EditorSeptember  

Haruki Murakamis memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a reflection on the harmonious duality of Murakamis life as both a runner and a writer PERIOD By mapping out how his relationship with running has changed over time Murakami pulls back the curtain to reveal his personal life as well as how he has coped with his aging body PERIOD Its a great read for any fans of Murakami as well as anyone who has had a lifelong relationship with a hobby PERIOD

One thing that initially stuck out to me as I was reading was the runners adage Murakami cites pain is inevitable suffering is optional PERIOD The saying seems so simple so pedestrian that it activated that big red too good to be true button in my brain PERIOD Is this all that running is Im asking myself as I read just the ability to be blissfully ignorant to our own pain

Uncomfortable with the way this proposition sat in my head I decided to test it out for myself PERIOD Murakami  acclaimed novelist teeshirt collector and overall cool guy  is one of my biggest heroes both in a literary sense and as a human being PERIOD So I wanted to make sure I did everything right meaning following his routine as diligently as I possibly could PERIOD This meant waking up at  a.m. running six miles and going to bed at  p.m. while also restricting my diet to principally vegetables and fruit PERIOD

I figured this was going to be pretty tough given that Ive never really been a runner and havent intentionally woken up before  a.m PERIOD in months and this assumption was totally accurate PERIOD It turns out that waking up  and then mustering up the strength to actually get out of bed  at  in the morning is a ginormous feat PERIOD In fact Im only capable of doing so roughly  of the time  and that data only accounts for the one week in which I had the extra motivation of knowing my responsibility to write about the experience PERIOD

I will say though that on the days I was able to get out of bed on time and go running I found the experience mostly pleasant PERIOD Running in the cool pitchblack air is a much different sensation than running in the sweltering heat with cars and pedestrians swirling around you PERIOD Its difficult to explain but the world has an uncanny tranquility and pleasantness when everyone is asleep PERIOD As I cross Reynolda Road and start jogging through a quiet slice of Winston Salem suburbia I feel totally at peace PERIOD The orbs of amber and white in the sky guide me where I need to go and the lawn signs for local politicians and civil servants make me feel safe PERIOD Theres something about at least keeping up the pretense of caring about democracy that an American finds comforting in new locations PERIOD

Despite my attempts at romanticization one unavoidable truth about running is that it sucks on a physical level PERIOD Even the people I know who genuinely love running dont find it to be a pleasant experience in any concrete sense PERIOD This seemingly paradoxical statement is one that Murakami dives into in his book so let me do my best to make sense of this nonsense PERIOD

The act of picking up one leg and putting it down in front of the other for an hour on end is a torturous process especially if youre thinking about how far you have to go or how much homework you have to do when youre done PERIOD The soreness and tightness you feel in your legs are not pleasant in fact theyre pretty excruciating at times PERIOD The beautiful redeeming quality about running though is how it grants you the opportunity to enter a state somewhere in between consciousness and unconsciousness such that when you finish a long run you almost feel like being awoken from a trance PERIOD

At some point if you run long enough the pain numbs  or rather it becomes compartmentalized into something other than you PERIOD In this way Murakamis adage is true  while the pain is there we have the choice to think about it or ignore it PERIOD This isnt to say that it doesnt still hurt but rather that you have the ability to conquer it annex it and refute it PERIOD You can say to yourself to your legs So what Im going to stop no matter how painful it is. this idea that I have the ability to choose what I think about and what I let myself care about seems like one that could be pretty useful for my life in general and maybe yours too PERIOD

What I think is more useful than anything else from Murakamis book is the notion that each of us not only needs but deserves to have an activity such as running in our lives PERIOD Whether its mountain climbing gardening swimming yoga bicycling or some other activity it is crucial that we have something that grounds us makes us more in tune with our physical bodies PERIOD This not only provides us with routine and makes us healthy but adds depth and quality to our lives PERIOD

While I only really have a week that can inform my experience I can say that Murakami was able to better understand his own life through the act of running PERIOD Not only did running keep him in shape but it made his own life a story equally worth celebrating as the ones he created on the page PERIOD

In the incessant abstraction and alienation of daily life isnt something that makes us feel like whole human beings complimentary if not essential to our survival
