Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

January  

This is my second year at NIU and ever since arriving here Ive wondered why the university mascot is called the Huskies

Let me say that I have nothing against HuskiesIm an avid dog lover myself PERIOD

However after spending several hours cruising the cornfields by car bike and foot I have yet to see a Huskie bounding across the seemingly endless fields that surround our campus PERIOD

But if you pause by the cornfields for just a brief moment on a pleasant falls day one can possibly imagine and hear the sound of a mighty foethe Corn Borer European corn borer Ostrinia Nubilalis boring through its opponent PERIOD

No this is not an April Fools joke come early PERIOD This is a serious attempt to raise the consciousness of the student population and how erroneous it is to have a mascot that does not truly represent our school PERIOD

Doesnt the University of California at Santa Cruz have its Fighting Banana Slug Richland High School in the state of Washington is the Bombers in reference to the Hanford nuclear facility nearby and even closer to home the DeKalb High School Barbs PERIOD

The change to such a fitting and unique name to the Corn Borers will give us a mascot to be proud of because it represents our geographical heritage PERIOD

The new mascot would attract national attention to our school and more importantly to the fine and upcoming athletic programs we have at NIU PERIOD

In order for us to have the Corn Borers as our mascot we must show our interest and support in such a cause by expressing our views through the proper channels by letters to the editor the administration and to the appropriate Student Association members PERIOD
