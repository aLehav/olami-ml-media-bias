Last year after the Florida Relays coach Beth AlfordSullivan was not satisfied with her teams performance PERIOD

She felt last year Penn State struggled to compete and did not perform up to the caliber it was capable to PERIOD

Last weekend Penn States track and field team went down to Gainesville once again to compete in the Florida Relays PERIOD And just like last season it was the Nittany Lions first full outdoor meet of the spring PERIOD

However unlike last year AlfordSullivan was pleased with the way her team competed to open up the outdoor season PERIOD And she thinks the difference hinged on one thing  weather PERIOD

Last year both days were about  and really humid and this year it was more like  AlfordSullivan said PERIOD The temperature this year was allowing us to recover in between events better last year it was probably just too hot for us. this was the first action of the year for a bunch of Penn State athletes and AlfordSullivan thinks they couldve been off their game PERIOD

But the coach said there will definitely be improvements made by those athletes over the course of the year especially now because they are competing in nice conditions and starting to practice outside when the weather improves in State College PERIOD

Our javelin throwers our discus throwers our quarter hurdlers and our steeplechasers were looking a little rusty AlfordSullivan said PERIOD Yet were getting good marks and I think theyre only going to progress through the season. thanks to a win in the triple jump by sophomore Hanif Johnson a secondplace showing by Ryan Foster in the 800meter  a school record by the mens 4x400m relay team and strong efforts from both male and female throwers  Penn States outdoor season is off to a solid start this year PERIOD

The current No PERIOD  ranked Penn State womens team along with the unranked mens team will use this faster start as a stepping stone for the rest of the long outdoor season PERIOD

The indoor season stretches a little more than two months while the outdoor season can last up to four weeks longer if athletes compete in the USATF Junior and Senior Championships at the end of June PERIOD

During this stretch the Lions will travel often and only compete at home once  the Jim Thorpe Invitational on May  PERIOD

This is a big adjustment from the indoor season when Penn State had its first four meets of the season at home in the Ashenfelter MultiSport Facility PERIOD
