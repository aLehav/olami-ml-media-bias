Theres a right way to do postpunk guitar music and I may have found the next band thats doing just that PERIOD

Hypoluxo a band of four from Brooklyn was featured in an Instagram post by music media outlet Stereogum PERIOD I was intrigued by the mention of postpunk in the caption PERIOD I usually consider that my favorite genre and seeing as to how lately I have not been passionately listening to music like I used to I wondered if this could be the band that could spark my interest PERIOD

Theres an abrasive way to do postpunk that can be charming and more rhythm sectionbased as bands like Protomartyr have demonstrated PERIOD I tend to prefer the more reverberating shimmering guitar sound similar to bands like Beach Fossils and DIIVs first album Oshin. hypoluxos Kentucky Smooth is essentially the perfect song to represent my taste in music as is recent single Nimbus. kentucky Smooth has the right amount of distortion on the guitars and features a drum buildup that belongs in much larger venues than I assume the band is playing in PERIOD A little bit before the three minute mark the two guitars play off each other with a minimal amount of notes which I believe is the key to great postpunk PERIOD

Nimbus which is to be featured on the bands upcoming album sears through the intro with a stopstart chord progression that reminds me of Chicago band Deeper but then the verse switches between those chords and a brief melody that I hope the album contains more of PERIOD

Spotifys Fans also like feature contains two bands I also really enjoy Dehd and Deeper who both put out solid records in  PERIOD According to the Stereogum post the album will be released this Friday November  PERIOD

Upon listening to only a few songs and the upcoming albums singles I cant help but feel that this record will follow suit PERIOD

Stereogum named it their record of the week and not only am I envious that they have enough clout to listen to records early but also from what Ive heard I think that it could be one of the best albums of the year if it bears any similarity to its predecessors PERIOD Not that Im saying the band shouldnt evolve PERIOD I have a feeling the only way for Hypoluxo to go is up PERIOD
