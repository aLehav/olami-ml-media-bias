Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





Garrett Shrader tries to avoid a tackle in the game against Alabama PERIOD MSU lost  to Alabama PERIOD

Only two games remain in the regular season for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs PERIOD They will need to win both of them if they hope to make a postseason bowl game PERIOD This has left a sense of urgency with the Bulldogs starting quarterback Tommy Stevens a graduate from Indianapolis Indiana PERIOD

Its what were gonna have to do Stevens said PERIOD Theres no other choice. there is indeed no other path for the Bulldogs to become bowl eligible outside of a twogame home stretch against two very different opponents PERIOD

The first test will be Abilene Christian University a  FCS team out of the Southland Conference PERIOD While the Bulldogs will be heavily favored the Homecoming Game could be shaken up PERIOD There could be distractions that allow the underdog Wildcats to be stronger competition against their SEC opponent PERIOD

Still there seems to be almost no scenario in which Abilene Christian could pull off the upset PERIOD That is unless the Bulldogs completely overlook the game in favor of focusing on the University of Mississippi PERIOD Head Coach Joe Moorhead has assured fans the team will not let the future distract them from the present PERIOD

We need to be focused on the task at hand PERIOD Certainly everyone knows what is looming on the back end of this a huge game a huge rivalry game Moorhead said. our focus will turn to that the second the clock ticks zero against Abilene Christian PERIOD Right now all of the focus and attention of the players and staff are on doing what is necessary to get win No PERIOD  and beat Abilene Christian PERIOD When the clock hits zero it will be full speed ahead to the last game. no matter how fast the Bulldogs will be able to turn their attention to Ole Miss they will still be behind in the preparation process because Ole Miss will be coming off a bye week PERIOD The Thanksgiving day kickoff and the shortened week of practice prior to the Egg Bowl will leave the Bulldogs at a disadvantage PERIOD The Rebels have been able to focus on and prepare for the Egg Bowl since their loss against the No PERIOD  team Louisiana State University PERIOD

While the Rebels lost  to the topranked Tigers they were still able to hold their own against them accumulating  total offensive yards PERIOD Many of those offensive yards weredue to adeadly rushing attack led by John Rhys Plumlee and Jerrion Ealy PERIOD The matchup against Ole Miss has many fans concerned more so than they are with the Abilene Christian game PERIOD This worry is due to the sheer difference of talent between the two teams and the intensity of the rivalry surrounding the Egg Bowl PERIOD

Regardless the Bulldogs remain confident in their ability to qualify for a bowl game PERIOD It certainly seems to be within reach and a core goal for players PERIOD The prospect of an extra game is definitely on the mind of senior offensive lineman Darryl Williams from Bessemer Alabama PERIOD

We got a lot left to play for said Williams PERIOD We get two more home games PERIOD The opportunity to get bowl eligible. the final question regarding the Egg Bowl is job security PERIOD Both head coaches have come under fire amid poor plays but both are still calling the shots PERIOD The Egg Bowl is huge for both fans and recruits therefore it has a significant impact on job security PERIOD If MSUs head coach Joe Moorhead can pull out a win against the Rebels it seems probable that he will return for another year PERIOD If not MSU could easily be in search of a new head coach PERIOD

No matter what happens the next two weeks are the last two chances the Bulldogs have to become bowl eligible PERIOD Their first chance will be this Saturday against Abilene Christian University at  p.m PERIOD Moorhead said the team is excited to play PERIOD

 Moorhead said PERIOD The fans are going to be into it PERIOD The fans are going to be excited PERIOD We are excited to come out PERIOD The last two games of the season are at home PERIOD The kids are very excited about it. log In
