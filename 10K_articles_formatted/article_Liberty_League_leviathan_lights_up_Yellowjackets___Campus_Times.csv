The first half of the womens lacrosse teams matchup with Union College was something like a runaway train PERIOD

Liza Maizel had a goal and an assist in the recent loss to Union PERIOD Courtesy of UR Athletics PERIOD

It took a full three minutes for the Dutchwomen  who entered the game second in the Liberty League with a  record against conference rivals  to break through a tough UR defense PERIOD Up to this point the visiting Jackets had kept Union on its toes making several drives at opposing net before losing track of Unions Casey Dianni who scored her eleventh goal of the season and first of the cool afternoon on Saturday April  PERIOD

Once the Dutchwomen got rolling however there was no turning back PERIOD Unions offense took to the Jackets net in each of the next two minutes before reaching a temporary halt as the yellow and blues junior Meg Battin put her team on the board with a little over  remaining in the first period PERIOD

At this point the Dutchwomen took full control going on a  rampage that wouldnt end until sophomore Liza Maizels lateperiod effort in the final five minutes of the game put a cap on the streak PERIOD The Jackets found themselves down by a considerable  margin with a full  minutes of play left in the game PERIOD

The second half however was a different story PERIOD UR returned to the field and proceeded to shut down Kristin Joyce  Unions lead scorer this season who laid siege to the Jackets defense with three goals and an assist in the first half  and the rest of the Dutchwomen allowing just four goals PERIOD The yellow and blues most lethal offensive threat in the  campaign sophomore Niki Holmes combated Joyces firsthalf firepower with three goals in the second half leading her team to an even  showing with Union in the second half PERIOD

Despite the strong latterhalf performance the Jackets   in the Liberty League ended up on the losing side of a  final tally PERIOD They travel to Clinton NY this Saturday April  to take on the Liberty Leagueleading Hamilton Continentals PERIOD
