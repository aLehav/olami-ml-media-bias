While sprinklers are keeping the grass green on campus most of Oklahoma is under the grips of one of the hottest and driest summers on record PERIOD



For about four months most of the state has experienced one of the harshest climates in recent memory PERIOD The average statewide total of rainfall is . inches in the last four months PERIOD That makes this the driest summer since  according to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey PERIOD



Howard Johnson associate state climatologist for the survey isnt happy with the current weather pattern PERIOD



Im not real optimistic about this weather pattern breaking at least on a longterm basis Johnson said PERIOD And our indications show this could be a longterm pattern. since the beginning of April about twothirds of Oklahoma has received insufficient amounts of rain PERIOD Only the northern third of the state ranging from the panhandle to the far northeast has received more than  percent of its usual average total from April  to Aug PERIOD  PERIOD



Stephen Stadler professor of geography said that the combination of record heat with little rain has had a big effect on the atmosphere PERIOD



When you couple the lack of rainfall with the record heat the atmosphere just isnt right to produce significant amounts of rain Stadler said PERIOD



Basically the water balance is out of whack PERIOD The atmosphere is not delivering because of the extreme conditions we are experiencing and things just arent working out like they normally should. he also said that the longrange weather pattern doesnt show any help on the way in what Stadler calls a droughtbuster PERIOD



Some weather models have said that a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico might bring some precipitation our way but realistically that isnt very likely Stadler said PERIOD We need to get a system up here that will cover most of the state and rain for two or three days straight PERIOD But even that wouldnt help. stadler said that Oklahoma just doesnt normally get the kind of rain it needs so badly right now PERIOD



Oklahoma isnt conducive to get the style of rain we need PERIOD We get thunderstorms that dump a lot of rain in one small area PERIOD That usually never helps the state as a whole PERIOD We need anything we can get right now but the situation is just too bad right now. stadler said after the first half of September that the state should see an increase of rain through November PERIOD



Those months should see an increase in precipitation PERIOD The sun will get lower in the sky and we will have less daylight hours to get us so warm PERIOD That will help. farmers are probably the biggest losers of the drought PERIOD Most notably the wheat producers across the state PERIOD



Gene Krenzer small grain extension specialist said the drought is lowering potential wheat yields and amazing some of the older farmers with its severity PERIOD



Ive had 80yearold farmers tell me that this is the driest summer they have ever seen PERIOD Some of those guys were in their 20s during the Dust Bowl days. krezner also said that if the current conditions remain the same through November farmers would be planting their wheat too late to have a good yield PERIOD



Many farmers will wait until there has been enough rain to plant wheat PERIOD Normally they begin to plant in midSeptember PERIOD



If they have to wait until November the yield would be cut almost  percent PERIOD



Since we are so dry they would have to rely on key rains in the fall and that just isnt looking like its going to happen. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",Oklahoma experiencing record heat  |  | ocolly.com,Oklahoma State University
