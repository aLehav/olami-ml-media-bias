For business administration freshman Audrey Nguy the source of her self confidence does not come from makeup or social media but rather powerlifting PERIOD

I am not that girl who goes in to the gym to only do fivepound sets and I am not the girl going in to do fivepound sets to watch a dude slam ten Nguy said PERIOD I am going in to slam that ten for myself. nguy found her love for weight and powerlifting in her freshman year of high school when she was on her high schools track team PERIOD During this time Nguy participated in shot put and disc which involved a lot of weight training PERIOD

I was realizing that I preferred to be in the weight room than actually on the track Nguy said PERIOD

Nguy did weightlifting for her first two years of high school and then transitioned to powerlifting her junior and senior year PERIOD Training for powerlifting consisted of Nguy going to the gym for two hours a day six days a week for six to seven months straight PERIOD

At her first meet Nguy was racking about  pounds whereas other powerlifters normally racked between  to  pounds per meet PERIOD Nguy currently has the ability to lift up to  pounds PERIOD

Nguy remembers her first meet being extremely nervewracking and intense PERIOD

I was the youngest girl there I am  and I was barely lifting  pounds Nguy said PERIOD You have to have a very heavy mindset to go through powerlifting in comparison to other sports. although the sport is demanding Nguy wanted to do something that would physically push her that was outside of school PERIOD
