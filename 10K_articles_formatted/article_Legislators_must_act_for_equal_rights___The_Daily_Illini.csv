2507,2023-11-04,"sunday marked the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots which was the beginning of an unsung civil rights movement in American history the gay rights movement PERIOD

The police raid at a gay bar in New Yorks Greenwich Village called the Stonewall Inn in the early hours of June   put the rights of gay Americans into the limelight PERIOD

But forty years later even after significant changes in cultural attitudes equal rights for gay people is not a prominent issue on the state or national political agenda PERIOD

In fact a civil unions bill was proposed in Illinois during the spring legislative session but was not voted on PERIOD

We urge leaders in Illinois and around the country to make equal rights for all people regardless of sexual orientation a priority PERIOD



Polls show support for civil unions in Illinois to be around  percent PERIOD

The Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Unions Act was rereferred to the House Rules Committee at the end of the last legislative session as budgetary matters took center stage even though infighting between legislative leaders and the governor took the place of substantive deliberations PERIOD

While lack of a wellplanned budget will debilitate the state governmet lack of equal rights for the people of Illinois hurts the citizens and disables their trust and faith in govenment PERIOD

The lawmakers in Illinois cannot continue to put issues of fundamental civil rights on the back burner PERIOD

We urge the sponsors of this bill to reintroduce it in the fall and hope lawmakers will finally address this baseless source of inequality PERIOD

The Illinois Legislature and Congress lag sorely behind society in recognition of gay rights issues PERIOD

Seventy five percent of Americans support repeal of the militarys dont ask dont tell policy and  percent support civil unions PERIOD

During his campaign President Barack Obama promised to end dont ask dont tell and to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act which defines marriage as between a man and woman PERIOD So far the president has yet to act on either of these goals PERIOD

Some observers speculate that President Obamas reluctance stems from a desire to not see his own health care proposal sabotaged by the controversy over the samesex marriage debate PERIOD

But basic civil rights for gay Americans have taken a backseat to supposedly more pressing issues for far too long PERIOD

The president should fulfill his campaign promises and his commitment to equality by putting gay rights on the national agenda PERIOD

While Illinois residents gay rights supporters and even Gov PERIOD Quinn took part in the festivities of the Gay Pride Parade in Chicago on Sunday the reality of the situation is not as festive PERIOD

Its time for Springfield and Washington to understand the importance of these reforms for gay citizens and take action to undo one of the last great barriers in civil rights PERIOD

Forty years is too long to wait PERIOD",Legislators must act for equal rights - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
