Music can be experienced in a variety of ways that have evolved over time PERIOD Owners of Truth Vinyl Ric Delzell and Carol Anderson describe the beauty of vinyl and the truth it speaks PERIOD

Delzell grew up with vinyl and transitioned to CDs when they made their debut PERIOD He had gotten rid of his turntable but kept all of his records PERIOD In the late 90s he began to listen to vinyl records again because his daughters were listening to them PERIOD

I kept my records because you know you attach yourself to stuff as a kid and they just have meaning to you Delzell said PERIOD

Unlike Delzell Anderson does not collect vinyls PERIOD After spending one year doing inventory for the store before it opened she learned about different kinds of records she found while browsing PERIOD

Delzell and Anderson use a large database for buying and selling records called Discogs PERIOD One day she stumbled upon a record that was shocking she said PERIOD

While she was putting things into Discogs Anderson said she came across a record company she didnt know of called KKK PERIOD When she looked at the other side of the record it showed a song titled Daddy Swiped Our Last Clean Sheet and Joined the KKK she said PERIOD

After doing some research Delzell found many underground labels like this one across the country PERIOD The selling of these KKK records is prohibited on Discogs Anderson said PERIOD

Vinyls came about a long time ago but it seems that the trend is returning to this generation Delzell said PERIOD There is a connection between millennials and baby boomers PERIOD They both like organic things he said PERIOD

They decided that it was a cool thing PERIOD Actually in reality from a technical standpoint there is more information on a vinyl record than there is on an MP3 PERIOD So its closer to the original recording than a CD or a digital file is because they have to compress it so much to make it usable that you lose a lot of the real sound Delzell said PERIOD

Unlike Spotify one has to be involved with vinyl from beginning to end  holding it in ones hands taking it out of the jacket setting it on the turntable putting the needle on it and flipping it once one side is over Anderson said PERIOD

Music is music bottom line PERIOD Whether you listen to Spotify or you listen to your phone or a record it doesnt really matter PERIOD Music is whats important and all those things have a place PERIOD Its just vinyl has a place too Delzell said PERIOD Its so much fun when you have people gathered around your house and you play records on a turntable PERIOD Its like people get involved because then they want to go look at the cover and they want to pick some records out and they want to play them. along with involving oneself physically vinyl causes one to involve all senses Delzell said PERIOD Vinyl is something to touch hear see and even smell PERIOD One must immerse themselves to fully enjoy vinyl he said PERIOD

Vinyl changes a persons musical experience PERIOD The equipment is addicting because people always want better so they invest in higherend records and equipment Anderson said PERIOD

Its so great they want more Anderson said PERIOD

Delzell was in marketing for  years working as a creative director PERIOD After working in the digital world for  years he began to feel stifled and left the marketing world PERIOD He spent five years thinking about what he wanted to do and could not figure it out he said PERIOD

I always loved music so one day I swear was just sitting there it just hit me Im gonna open a record store Delzell said PERIOD

The most difficult part about opening the store was finding a location because not a lot of people believed in the business and while Arlington is known for the mall the city did not have a core people flocked to Delzell said PERIOD

I think the core is always going to be developed by the independent businessperson Delzell said PERIOD

The experience given by vinyl speaks a truth that is different from other forms of music Delzell said PERIOD

Theres something to listening to music in this form that is the truest reproduction of the original performance that you could possibly get PERIOD Its the closest its the truest sound Delzell said PERIOD
