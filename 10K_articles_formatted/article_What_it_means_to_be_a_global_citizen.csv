So here in a list of pros and cons is my best attempt at laying out what it means to be a global citizen in my 19years of experience

Pros



Cons

There you have it broken down into two arbitrary chunks of bad and good a single shallow portrait of global citizenry PERIOD Although a handful of negatives and positives does little to represent the reality of a life of movement its always helpful to remember the importance of cultural diversity and its potential joys in a world that seems eager to divide itself along borders of national alliance PERIOD
