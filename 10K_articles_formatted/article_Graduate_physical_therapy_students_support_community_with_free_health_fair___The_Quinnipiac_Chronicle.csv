Organizers offered both Zoom and inperson options PERIOD Presentations were provided in both English and Spanish PERIOD

Julianne Smith one of the student organizers said the partnership with the center was a great opportunity to help out the larger community PERIOD

The whole point of the capstone is to have that partnership and that community connection Smith said PERIOD That way we can work on identifying the needs of the Keefe Center and the needs of the community and offer our help PERIOD We are trying to bridge the gap between the community and those health resources. smith said as many as  people came to the fair counting families with children PERIOD

The center provides many community resources such as a monthly diaper bank and a food pantry on Mondays Tuesdays and Thursdays PERIOD

There were different demonstrations at the fair such as tabling and presentations on nutrition chronic illness heart disease diabetes womens health and breast cancer PERIOD The fair also offered drivethrough child car seat checks through Safe Kids Worldwide PERIOD

Safe Kids did do one car seat safety check for someone who came from Bridgeport said Julie Booth associate director of clinical education in PT PERIOD The car seat was installed incorrectly so they fixed this and the Dad is coming this week to have the car seat in his car reinstalled. quinnipiack Valley Health District was at the fair to offer COVID19 vaccines PERIOD Even though Booth said none were administered volunteers were able to share information on the importance of getting booster vaccines PERIOD

Suzanne Powell was one of the presenters at the event advocating for breast cancer awareness with the Connecticut wisewoman program PERIOD Powell encouraged people to come to a mobile mammogram clinic at the center next week PERIOD

Get your yearly screenings so that you can catch it early and were here to support you Powell said PERIOD

Another table at the event was EQUIP Rehabilitation PERIOD Rachel Harris a member of the free physical therapy clinic said that EQUIP provides community resources and screenings and currently runs classes on campus with the North Haven Senior Center PERIOD

 Rachel Harris Quinnipiacs fitness instructor

Nicole Mawhirter and Christina DePaulis are part of the Quinnipiac graduate PT club PERIOD They presented on back and spine health and how physical therapy benefits people PERIOD

We hope people learn some tips about posture body mechanics and sleep habits as well as some general education on physical therapy DePaulis said PERIOD

The organizers said they hope that people who attended the fair will take care of their health and will be aware of the resources available to them PERIOD

As future health care providers we can work on getting that community connection and practice connecting our patients to the proper resources that they need to promote their health and wellness and make sure that they know how to be an active participant in their health care Smith said PERIOD

Meaghan Johnson and Gabrielle Neiss both sophomore nursing majors said they did not hear about the free health fair PERIOD However they believe that this fair would be another way for people to gain access to health care and will be beneficial for the community PERIOD

Were students in the school of nursing and overall interprofessionalism with working with different providers is really important so I think the more that people know about it the more people can work together and really emphasize the interprofessional aspect of health science programs at Quinnipiac Johnson said PERIOD

Preventive care was the emphasis of the fair with student organizers such as Reilly Zajac trying to reduce the amount of preventable illness PERIOD

Even if just one person goes and gets a cancer screen or just one person changes their nutrition so they can stop taking their diabetes medicine it will have a very impactful and meaningful purpose for the fair Zajac said PERIOD

Organizers stressed nutrition during the fair by offering healthy food such as fresh fruit PERIOD

Meaghan Scullin another organizer from the PT program said that many people coming to the fair rely on the food bank because they do not have access to healthy foods PERIOD

We are providing an incentive to come that we have healthy foods health screenings and COVID vaccines but at the same time we are giving people the tools and the knowledge that they need to take care of their own health Scullin said PERIOD

Scullin said that it should be a priority for Quinnipiac to give back to the Hamden community PERIOD
