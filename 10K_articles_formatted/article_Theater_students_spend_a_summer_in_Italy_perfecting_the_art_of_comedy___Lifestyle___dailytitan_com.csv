One day all of the class was standing on one side of the room with their hands out and theres one person on the other side who had to run and jump on top of the group and we had to lift the person up Emeahara said.After spending 10hours a day doing various physical activities the students had earned their weekends off to explore the city and meet new people PERIOD
