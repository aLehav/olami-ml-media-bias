Sustainability quality and community are all important aspects when looking at an organization PERIOD Sometimes organizations are sustainable in their purpose but unable to be sustainable in their leadership PERIOD Quality over quantity is usually a good measurement when judging the actions that should be taken regarding any given activity PERIOD And a community should always be fostered grown and built on the premise of welcoming diversity PERIOD All three of these aspects come into play when talking about Veg Out a vegan based organization at West Chester University WCU PERIOD

History

First founded around  Veg Out was meant to be a place for students to come together and discuss veganism as well as serve as an environment open to personal beliefs on the matter PERIOD Since the organizations founding it has undergone leadership changes and tackled the issue of sustainability of leadership within its own walls PERIOD Prior leadership within the organization focused on collaboration with PETA People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PERIOD The organization has since shifted to focus more on the vegan aspect of the organization spreading information on the topic and sharing food in the process PERIOD Overall Veg Out is a place for all students no matter your dietary preference PERIOD After facing a slight dormant period during the virtual academic year like many organizations at WCU Veg Out has since been revitalized PERIOD

Uniqueness

The main sticking point making Veg Out unique is its emphasis on veganism and while it is not a determining factor for its membership the organization does serve as a home for those that are vegan PERIOD The organization is also a place where students can pick up new recipes and share their own vegan creations with their community PERIOD Veg Out is also a relaxed organization that hosts events that revolve around yoga painting and even gardening PERIOD With another goal of environmental sustainability Veg Out looks to accomplish said goal through community events and spreading useful information to peers PERIOD The organization is also a place where students can get weekly vegan meals on and offcampus PERIOD Through sustainability high quality food and a relaxed and educational community Veg Out is a unique organization that deserves a visit PERIOD

Service

Through collaboration with groups both on and offcampus Veg Out seeks to commit to service PERIOD Most of the organizations service opportunities revolve around events like a fundraiser the organization hosted this past December PERIOD Veg Out through that fundraiser raised over . for the organization Support and Feed PERIOD Another instance of the organization giving back would be when the organization volunteered at the south campus gardens on April  of this year PERIOD Veg Out is dedicated to service all around the WCU community and you can read more about their upcoming service events in the upcoming events section PERIOD From partnerships with the Sustainable Living Yoga Club to collaborations revolving around plantbased cooking with faculty like Dr PERIOD Subach the organization tries to give back at every turn possible while involving the community along the way PERIOD
