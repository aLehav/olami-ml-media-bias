CJ McClain  during the game against NC State at Sherri Parker Lee Stadium on April   PERIOD

No PERIOD  Tennessee wrapped up the weekend series against NC State with a  win to sweep the Wolfpack and extend its win streak to  games PERIOD

Junior CJ McClain went 3for3 in the Volunteers win with two twoout RBI singles at the bottom of the order PERIOD The first drove in freshman Chelsea Seggern to break up a  tie in the fourth inning PERIOD The second was an infield single that gave the Vols their  final score PERIOD

McClains speed gives her the opportunity to turn any sort of contact into a base hit PERIOD

As long as I put it on the ground I feel like Im always giving myself a chance McClain said PERIOD Im just hoping that the defense will make a mistake or I beat it out. her speed makes her a threat once shes on base too PERIOD She stole two bases in Sundays game and leads the team with  steals PERIOD

Tennessee cohead coach Ralph Weekly has kept McClain at ninth in the batting order to function as a second leadoff hitter but said after Sundays game that could change if she continues to hit that way PERIOD

CJ McClain is a tremendous athlete she may be one of the top three athletes in the whole SEC cohead coach Ralph Weekly said PERIOD Shes got a great arm great speed and shes developed into a topnotch ball player. megan Geer went deep again with a tworun home run to center field in the fifth inning to give the Vols a comfortable  lead PERIOD The senior had a grand slam in Game  and finished the series with six RBIs PERIOD Sophomore Brooke Vines had a quiet day at the plate but extended her careerbest hit streak to  games PERIOD

Sophomore Kelsey Morrison started the game but was removed in the second inning after giving up a walk and a single PERIOD Freshman Caylan Arnold ended up tossing six innings with strikeouts and no earned runs PERIOD She was in the circle when NC State scored its only run of the game on a passed ball in the second inning PERIOD

Sophomore Katie Weimer took over for junior Scarlet McSwain behind the plate in the top of the fourth inning and caught the remainder of the game PERIOD Tennessee has been without Abby Lockman after the freshman sprained her ankle in pregame practice early last week PERIOD

After taking Monday off Tennessee will return to the field Tuesday night April  at  p.m PERIOD for the final game of the 10game home stand against Eastern Kentucky PERIOD

It is rare that the team takes a Monday off but after playing five games in six days the coaches felt like the team needed a day to recover PERIOD
