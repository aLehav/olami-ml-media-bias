5460,2016-02-18,"at the bottom corner of each page in our 400page syllabus there is a small note warning us to share only with Stanford School of Medicine. after all it would be a shame to make our learning material publicly available when we are charged nearly  in annual tuition to gain access to it PERIOD

But rest assured administrators PERIOD Our current syllabus is so shoddily produced and the content so scattered that even if it were made publicly available there would be little if any rush to pirate it PERIOD At least not when we as medical students can resort to other resources that teach the material with better efficiency and clarity PERIOD

Heres the hard truth If we do not come together to design a better curriculum within the next few years classroom learning at Stanford Medical School and perhaps at most medical schools will go extinct PERIOD Right now our curriculum is already on life support PERIOD

Only a paltry dozen if not fewer out of a class of  students attend lecture PERIOD In fact a close classmate of mine has not attended class since the fall of his first year and he has learned the material as well as the rest of us if not better PERIOD At this rate of attrition our professors will soon be lecturing to an empty classroom PERIOD

In an age when the world is as flat and hyperconnected as ever and the term MOOC is a part of our daily lingo any and all information can and will be shared freely and medical knowledge is no exception PERIOD Stanford should be all too familiar with this revolution as it is one of the major proponents PERIOD

And so we find ourselves attending Stanford Medical School but learning much of our medicine  disease symptoms organ physiology anatomy and even performing a physical  by relying on material that anyone in the world with an Internet connection can access PERIOD

We must ask ourselves if Stanford or any medical school for that matter can create a better curriculum than the combination of Khan Academy Pathoma Lippencotts Goljans Rapid Pathology Review First Aid Strong Medicine Kaplan USMLE World SketchyMicro FireCracker DoctorsInTraining Picmonic UpToDate MedScapeand even Wikipedia PERIOD

These resources none of which require taking out a student loan and are multiplying every year are only a small sample of what Stanford Medicine must contend with in order to keep its students in the classroom PERIOD

Nevertheless Stanford has tried to stem its hemorrhage of student interest PERIOD The main strategy it seems is to make learning medicine less of a bitter pill to swallow PERIOD Our curriculum is studded with lectures emphasizing cuttingedge research PERIOD We have professors boasting impressive resumes and administrative titles as lecturers PERIOD Instead of PowerPoints we have animations to help us learn pharmacology and microbiology PERIOD Many of our classes are taught in a flipped classroom model to encourage participation PERIOD

But learning medicine was and will be never easy and it is not intended to be PERIOD Shortcuts do not exist PERIOD And this reality cannot be buried underneath all the latest educational trends and fancy gadgetry PERIOD

So what can Stanford Medicine do instead It must emphasize its resources that cannot be reproduced through an ebook or a YouTube video PERIOD It must focus on its research and clinical training PERIOD

Stanford should do away with the traditional two years of preclinical training an outdated tradition that was adopted more than a century ago PERIOD For a university that is proud of innovation its ironic that its medical school curriculum has its foundation in a report that was written before sliced bread was invented PERIOD

Instead Stanford can start preclinical classes in the summer of its first year and end in following fall PERIOD What we lose in the preclinical time is inconsequential to what we would gain  the freedom of an entire year dedicated solely to research and an earlier start to clinical rotations and electives PERIOD And in order to eliminate the discontinuity and inefficiencies of the preclinical curriculum we need a dedicated team of lecturers with backgrounds in pathology and physiology whose primary interest lies in the classroom rather than in the laboratory or the clinic PERIOD

The mission of Stanford Medical School aims not only to produce future physicians but also to train leaders who one day will leave their footprint on medicine PERIOD That will not be accomplished by teaching microbiology through cartoons PERIOD Dont forget that we came to Stanford Medical School for its research and hospitals PERIOD Its time to give us the opportunity to take advantage of them PERIOD
