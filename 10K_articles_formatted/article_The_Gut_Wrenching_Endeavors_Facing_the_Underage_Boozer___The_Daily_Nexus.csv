4144,2005-03-30,"twentyfour days PERIOD

I have to keep reminding myself Just  more days while I grit my teeth PERIOD

What happens on April  you may wonder Well according to the handydandy  calendar in the Nexus office on this particular day Passover just so happens to begin at midnight PERIOD It also happens to be the day after Earth Day as well as William Shakespeares birthday PERIOD So in homage to Hamlet the socalled greatest play ever written Ill be at my house or some local watering hole getting mollywhopped PERIOD

But my choice of consuming alcoholic goodness will have less to do with the tragic end of Hamlet and more to do with enjoying a cold one or  on this special day PERIOD These beers will have a different zing to them PERIOD The hops will be sweeter the carbonation will be potent the pour will display a perfect head of foam and the temperature will be so cold I will feel its chilled liquid goodness flow from my throat all the way down to my liver PERIOD

Why will this godlike beverage taste even more godlike

Because I will have no apprehensions that an incognito IVFP officer might be lurking on my oceanside balcony with an MIP ticket in hand PERIOD I wont have to pester my roommates to pick me up a sixer after being at work all night PERIOD I wont be left alone to drown my sorrows in a bottle of Makers Mark while my roommates are out soaking up pitchers at Sams or throwing back tequila shots downtown PERIOD

Thats right your pseudo beer columnist and worthless excuse of an opinion editor will be legal PERIOD

You see being underage never used to be a big deal PERIOD During the adolescent stage sneaking 12packs of Natty into the dorms after a big bad 21yearold bought it for you was actually kind of stimulating PERIOD Being away from home and having your own cold brewskies instead of sneaking your old mans coveted brew provided some sort of thrill PERIOD That and disguising your liquor exploits from those sneaky RAs PERIOD

But the love affair with shady beer runs and sneaking into dorm rooms quickly wears off after realizing how goddamned inconvenient it is PERIOD Then comes the almost legal stage of actually knowing a couple of your close buddies from early back who are of that blissful age PERIOD Buying beer with relative ease  and legally no less  is some sort of reprieve from God Sean hang in tough buddy  youre almost to the holy age of legal purchasing of hops and barley. unbeknownst to me almost is used pretty loosely PERIOD Almost seems like it has been going on for almost two years now PERIOD

Now Ive reached the worst stage PERIOD Its not even almost anymore PERIOD I call it the fuck me in the ass Im so close to being  and I hate my life stage PERIOD Because now everyone is  PERIOD Virtually all of my buddies who graced the debauched halls of Santa Rosa just two years ago are of that so elusive age of wonder and legality PERIOD Its not easy PERIOD After a good run of basketball at the Rec Cen my roommates take off to Woodstocks to polish off a couple of pitchers PERIOD Watching two of my esteemed colleagues at the Nexus take care of a pitcher of Firestone at Chilitos I sit and sip on my horchata envisioning that glorious day when I will be able to kick back a few malted beverages with them PERIOD

Needless to say Im going through a rough patch in my life PERIOD

But dont feel sorry for me I brandish a certain utopian vision of the future path that lies ahead of me riding my beach cruiser down DP with a 30pack of Keystone on my shoulder knowing that the popo dont got shit on me PERIOD Its throwing down Irish car bombs or soaking in the sun assimilating pitchers of Bud Light at Sams PERIOD My excitement to reach this day is so profound I wouldnt be doing this column justice by putting it in my own words PERIOD Instead Ill quote Morgan Freeman from The Shawshank Redemption Im so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. thanks Red PERIOD

Wait until Daily Nexus Assistant Opinion Editor Sean Swaby realizes you have to be  to rent a car PERIOD
