Its cold either snowing or raining and DePaul students are hopefully confidently wrapping up fall quarter finals and heading into the holiday season PERIOD This weeks cheap wine selection should carry you through any occasion whether that is drowning your graderelated sorrows or using your aunts annual Thanksgiving dinner to impress your cousins who go to state schools with your highfalutin taste in wine PERIOD All of these wines were found at the Lincoln Park Trader Joes on Diversey between Clark and Halsted which is easily accessible from DePauls Lincoln Park and Loop campuses via the Brown line PERIOD

Whats in it Sauvignon Blanc
Why I picked it This was another choice based on aesthetics PERIOD When there are so many different wines to choose from and the information on the label can only tell you so much I like to pick the bottle best suited for Pinterestinspired DIY creations that will never actually happen. my notes This mediumbodied haycolored white wine has predominantly green flavors which is not uncommon for a sauvignon blanc green apple green pear and grass are present PERIOD However unlike higher quality wines of the same varietal that are distinctively bright the flavors in this wine come off as muted and underdeveloped along with a brief taste of something weird like mustiness or wet forest floor PERIOD Its definitely tastier right out of the refrigerator when its most chilled PERIOD
Basically You can definitely do worse than this . italian sauvignon blanc but you could also luck out by another blind pick and do better PERIOD
What to drink it with A Thai or Indian dish with some light spice would go great with this wine PERIOD Bring a bottle to Noodles in the Pot on Halsted or Hemas Kitchen on Clark but as Trader Joes doesnt keep their wines cold youll have to bring it from home PERIOD

accordion titleTrader Joes Blanc de Blancs from France loadhide

Whats in it Chardonnay
Why I picked it Trader Joes has a pretty sizable selection of sparkling wines ranging from sparkling rose prosecco and even a sparkling almond flavored wine PERIOD I decided to keep my first review in the territory simple and what could be more simple than a Trader Joes name brand French brut
My notes As a brut its on the drier side of French sparkling wines but still has a slight touch of residual sugar that rounds it out PERIOD Overall the wine has a somewhat sour flavor with traces of yeast and floral notes but theres also some citrus in there that brightens it up a bit PERIOD
Basically While the flavor isnt my favorite it compares better than other popular sparkling wines at the same price point Andre for instance. what to drink it with Bubbles can be drunk with almost anything including on their own PERIOD Pop some bottles at a Friendsgiving or top it off with OJ at a BYOB brunch spot like Batter  Berries in DePauls own neighborhood PERIOD

accordion titleLazy Bones Cabernet Franc from California loadhide

Whats in it Cabernet Franc
Why I picked it After having already dropped a bottle of red in my basket I was moving on to look at the sparkling when I made an abrupt halt there it was the perfect bottle of wine aesthetically at least PERIOD The label shows a drawing of a naked girl lying in bed and petting a cat PERIOD The back of the bottle even says the best part of wasting the whole day is that its wholly yours to waste. nothing speaks truer PERIOD
My notes This mediumbodied red is tart and immediately dries out your tongue hello tannins but the richness and flavors of ripe red fruit and black pepper round it out nicely PERIOD Because of the fruits and spices present its similar to a French malbec less earthy than its Argentine counterpart and the alcohol is definitely present PERIOD
Basically Its a pretty tasty bottle of something a little different than the usual goto single varietals like pinot noir or cabernet sauvignon PERIOD An ideal wine to hibernate with this winter PERIOD
What to drink it with Cab francs go well with somewhat heavier dishes PERIOD Pour a glass to drink with the coldweather staple lentil soup while cocooned in your warmest fuzziest blanket PERIOD
