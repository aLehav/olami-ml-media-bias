Salvation at last PERIOD The two awards dished out at the Academy Awards for screenplays are usually a place of comfort for many film admirers upset at seeing some of the best most innovative films of the past year shut out in the socalled major categories PERIOD Do the names Trainspotting and Election ring a bell Both were highly honored and well reviewed during their release years but then overlooked by Oscar PERIOD That is overlooked except for the screenwriting categories PERIOD Neither won the big gold guy but their nominations proved that the old crusty traditional voters could recognize brilliance in at least the screenplay format PERIOD

This years nominees boast at least three films that many think were ignored come nomination time PERIOD Neither The Royal Tenenbaums or Ghost World have much of a shot this Sunday but their nominations kept a few movie aficionados from jumping off buildings PERIOD Both movies received only this nomination. memento also picked up a nomination for film editing where its odds are meager but the highly profitable independent film told in reverse is one of the favorites for original screenplay PERIOD

In the award for screenplay based on material previously produced or published Ghost World goes up against A Beautiful Mind In the Bedroom The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring and Shrek. yes thats correct Shrek. it is based on a childrens book about as long as a blue book. as for a screenplay written directly for the screen Memento and The Royal Tenenbaums battle Amelie Gosford Park and Monsters Ball. the screenplay for A Beautiful Mind was penned by Akiva Goldsman a writer notorious for churning out mediocre bigbudget action flicks that kill possible franchises Lost in Space and Batman and Robin PERIOD Goldsman took home the Golden Globe award for this category and will likely take home Oscar for his overrated script that hinges on a large plot twist followed by the mundane medical ups and downs of its hero John Nash PERIOD

With its victory A Beautiful Mind will be prevailing over some of the best scripts of recent memory PERIOD Many said it was impossible to successfully adapt The Fellowship of the Ring into a film that pleased old fans and new PERIOD However Peter Jackson stuck closely to the novel while instilling a constant energy into every sequence PERIOD

That Ghost World was even nominated is noteworthy the very alternative antimainstream indie has no real resolution and takes at least half an hour before viewers even know what its really about PERIOD It was one of the quirkiest and funniest films of  and at least the nomination will help more people see it PERIOD

Todd Fields In the Bedroom is brilliant in its simplicity and its execution of creating an exposition hinting at one film but turning into something completely different PERIOD Finally Shrek delivered a very clever and humorous tale that appealed to children and adults but the Academy would not be caught dead giving a screenplay award to an animated picture PERIOD

In the original screenplay category the two favorites are Memento and Gosford Park. it is truly a toss up as for who will win and each would be a worthy winner PERIOD This reviewer is going to give the edge to Julian Fellowes Gosford Park which has earned itself four awards so far PERIOD Julian Fellowes is an actor turned screenwriter and it shows in all the wonderful and dialogue and characters he created PERIOD

The screenplay for Memento deserves to take home the Oscar and it has won many critics awards already but the Academy has proved that it is not too fond of the Guy Pearce picture by only honoring it with two nominations PERIOD With story help from his brother Jonathon Christopher Nolan wrote one of the most cleverly crafted and inventive scripts ever thats right ever PERIOD The story itself is quite good but the imaginative structure is what gives its punch PERIOD Several studios rejected the screenplay because they found it too confusing  now Nolan is getting the last laugh PERIOD

Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson collaborated on The Royal Tenenbaums mixing offbeat subtle humor with beautiful sequences of honest family emotion PERIOD The Oscars are not ready to embrace the Rushmore creators yet but one day they will have their chance to thank their moms and teachers on the stage at the Kodak Theater PERIOD

Monsters Ball is an excellent melodrama that deals with reallife tragedy in a sometimes explicitly real manner PERIOD The script was elevated to even greater heights by an incredible cast PERIOD The two first time writers behind the project showcase a great understanding for the human condition especially hurt which they will feel once they suffer defeat PERIOD

The optimistic French import Amelie would probably have a great chance if it came out of America but the Academy tends to neglect superior foreign films when it comes time to name the winners PERIOD

When a screenwriter develops his characters within a threeact structure that includes scenes playing out as little movies of their own he dreams of a satisfied audience PERIOD An Oscar is just an added bonus to commemorate his achievement PERIOD
