On a cold and windy Wednesday afternoon University Nordic Ski Club members stretched in the lobby of Cooke Hall before heading outside for a run PERIOD

Members arent letting the lack of snow prevent them from preparing for when the white stuff actually falls PERIOD

The Nordic Ski Club which brings together students interested in crosscountry skiing participates in many competitions each winter according to kinesiology senior and club president Meleah Murphy PERIOD

It gives people who enjoy skiing an opportunity to get involved in racing and to do what they like to do she said PERIOD

Nursing junior and group member Rachel Erickson said there is a misconception that crosscountry skiing is boring flatsurface skiing PERIOD

They just think of their grandma skiing and its not true Erickson said PERIOD There are some amazing hills we ski on. many of the members said they joined the club because of their skiing involvement in high school and because it provides a healthy way to enjoy the outdoors throughout the winter PERIOD

Murphy said the club spends the majority of fall semester training and preparing for the competitions that begin each January PERIOD

I usually say that we ski both up and down hill Murphy said PERIOD Its more about endurance and health benefits than just pure enjoyment. unlike many other student groups the Nordic Ski Club is also a part of the Department of Recreational Sports club program according to the departments associate program director Jessica Novotny PERIOD

Nordic ski is one of those great sports that a lot of people like to participate in said Novotny who also advises the group PERIOD The club has been in good standing and done a fantastic job representing the University. the first big event of the season Murphy said is a group trip to Telemark Wis. around the last week of winter break PERIOD

Were up there for a week where we just eat sleep and ski basically she said PERIOD

The area is on the Birkie crosscountry ski trail which also happens to be the location of the American Birkebeiner the groups last big competition of the season PERIOD

Its a real teambuilding and bonding experience Murphy said of the upcoming trip PERIOD Its pretty much the highlight of the season I think. in addition to the American Birkebeiner the club competes in several races including the nationally renowned Vasaloppet in Mora where firstyear medical student and group member Bjorn Batdorf won the 42kilometer race the past two years PERIOD

The City of Lakes Loppet a 35kilometer race held in Minneapolis on the first weekend of February is also on the groups schedule PERIOD

We would love it if people from the University would cheer us on there Murphy said PERIOD

Crosscountry skiing is all about enjoying winter in a healthy way said global studies and French junior Iman Mefleh PERIOD

Its basically about being outside together with friends said Mefleh the clubs vice president PERIOD Its a lifetime sport and it encourages wellness and health. and while Murphy said the lack of snow is sometimes a concern it wont be a big deal if there isnt enough snow in Telemark PERIOD

Well just take a short trip up to Ironwood in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan instead I know theres snow there she said PERIOD
