In order to win tough matches the Penn State mens tennis team must learn to overcome adversity PERIOD

This was evident when the Lions dropped a gritty  match to Cornell Saturday at the Penn State Tennis Center PERIOD After losing the doubles point the Nittany Lions were unable to claw their way back PERIOD

Making matters worse was the absence of senior teamleader Roddy Cantey who sustained a knee injury Friday PERIOD

Mens Tennis

Cornell  Penn State 

 Penn State mens tennis coach Jan Bortner said PERIOD 

The Lions dropped all three doubles matches giving the early point to the Big Red PERIOD The lack of aggressive play from the Lions as well as a shakeup in the lineup due to Canteys injury allowed Cornell to sweep those matches PERIOD

Singles were not too much kinder to the Lions who took only two of the six matches PERIOD Senior Clint Keithley came out strong quickly winning the third singles match   against Brett McKeon PERIOD

 Keithley said PERIOD 

For much of singles play it looked like the Lions would carry out Keithleys message as every point for each team was a battle PERIOD

However the depth and confidence Cornell built with an early lead prevailed and the Big Red won the fifth and sixth singles matches in straight sets PERIOD

Another bright spot for the Lions on Saturday was the singles match of freshman Ryan Berger PERIOD Playing a big role for the Lions Berger saw action both in doubles and singles PERIOD

Picking up the second point for the Lions Berger defeated fellow top prospect Nick Brunner    PERIOD Bortner was pleased with the victory which could be a sign of things to come for collegiate tennis as two of the top freshmen in the country battled each other for three sets PERIOD

 Berger said PERIOD 

Overall the Lions played solidly in singles with some matches coming down to a point here or a point there PERIOD However the doubles play needs improvement in two areas the service play and returning volleys PERIOD

 Bortner said PERIOD

The Lions will need to work out their doubles play in order to stay with Central Florida this Friday PERIOD
