Dr PERIOD Earl Traynham has assumed the position of UNFs provost despite his active retirement PERIOD Photo courtesy of unf.edu
Since May  the position of UNFs provost has been filled by an interim replacement while a search committee projected a new replacement to be hired in May  PERIOD Now that dateis coming to a close and the search has been extended for another year PERIOD
When Mark Workman UNFs provost since  stepped down Dr PERIOD Earle Traynham came out of retirement to assume the responsibility at President John Delaneys request Traynham said PERIOD
The provost is the vice president of Academic Affairs who acts as liaison between UNFs multiple colleges and the Presidents Office PERIOD A provost is responsible for managing the funds for each educational department at UNF and coordinating with the deans of each college Traynham said PERIOD
Basically the provost is a middle man between the Presidents Office and the academic faculty which alleviates Delaneys stress of having to deal with every issue in the university Traynham said PERIOD
The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools which UNF has to appeal the accreditation of its academic efficiency to is deemed to occur this year PERIOD Part of the reason why Traynhams interim was extended is to act as UNFs representative during the meeting PERIOD
Originally when the President talked to me he talked in terms of  months PERIOD The idea was that the search would begin in the Fall of  for a permanent provost Traynham said PERIOD
Traynham agreed to stay on so that he could complete his design of allocating resources to UNFs departments PERIOD Each college was compared against itself to discover the most effective way to provide resources to them Traynham said PERIOD
A search committee has been formed to find a new acting provost but kept Traynham on for another year because he was effective at his job Vice President and Chief of Staff Dr PERIOD Thomas Serwatka said.The committee consists of  members deriving from a mix of administrative faculty staff and a member of the student body PERIOD Nine are from UNFs faculty consisting of deans and teachers PERIOD Seven are deans and members of UNFs administrative staff PERIOD Student Government President Carlo Fassi represents the student opinion President Delaney said in an email PERIOD
Specific characteristics which would deem an applicant appealing are being kept quiet by the committee PERIOD The qualifications of the applicant are preferably someone who has worked in academics for five years and has knowledge of how to coordinate with the multiple educational departments in a university Serwatka said PERIOD
The position has not been posted on unfjobs.org the universitys online job application site PERIOD One of the main concerns the committee has is that they need a candidate who is convincing through their own merit not through a list of qualities that they believe the committee is looking for Serwatka said PERIOD
We are coming up with a draft of what were going to put out but its not going to have a full listing of all the characteristics we think this person should have Serwatka said PERIOD
The search committee also plans to make the candidates letters and applications of the open to the public as well as the committees responses Serwatka said PERIOD
When we judge these people we want you to see what characteristics we judged them high on and what characteristics we had questions about Serwatka said PERIOD
The provost has to be able to secure the resources necessary for the educational departments to be successful Traynham said PERIOD
While hiring internally might produce someone who is familiar with UNFs academic system the committee strives to bring in someone who can introduce new ideas and progress the school as it evolves Serwatka said PERIOD
Serwatka also revealed that the interviews will be open to the public where students can sit through the process and ask the committee questions at the end PERIOD
