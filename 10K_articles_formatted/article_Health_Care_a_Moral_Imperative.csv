Today the United States faces a social and moral challenge PERIOD The system for managing the expenses and complexities of health care has turned against us or at least the less welloff among us PERIOD With prices soaring on health care costs and insurance the supposed greatest nation in the world has a health care system that is considered mediocre when juxtaposed with others PERIOD

For those who can afford insurance one can get some of the best health care in the world in this country PERIOD If you are uninsured or underinsured however it is a completely different story PERIOD

I would like to examine the issue by framing it within the concept of basic natural human compassion PERIOD First consider that health care in all its forms is necessary for human wellbeing PERIOD Is it not true that inadequate medical treatment is just as detrimental to the human life as hunger natural disaster or homelessness In the twenty-first century health care is essential to ensuring the unalienable rights laid out by our founding fathers PERIOD Denying or limiting medical treatment for those with restricted financial resources diminishes their quality of life and increases their suffering PERIOD As an American citizen I find the idea of accepting this deranged Darwinian survivaloftherichest health care system embarrassing PERIOD

The adoption of an allencompassing universal health care system would solve this problem PERIOD

Legislation to do this is pending in Congress PERIOD But staunch opposition grounded in partisan politics has stalled the process PERIOD Under the plan proposed by President Obama at the health care summit on Feb PERIOD  almost all Americans will be required to have health insurance PERIOD The core of the plan is an organized exchange created for individuals and small businesses with different competitive coverage options PERIOD For those who cannot afford the options government subsidies would cover the costs PERIOD

At the summit Republicans like Sen PERIOD Lamar Alexander RTenn. expressed their continuing opposition to Obamas plan for health care reform PERIOD Alexander stated that Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together in order to gradually make reforms and changes which he claims would make the process of reform easier and more effective PERIOD

Although I am a strong proponent of bipartisanship  I believe that blind and petty partisanship undermines American political institutions  in this case I believe the needs of the American people are far more important and the moral argument for universal health care is too compelling not to act as quickly as possible to comprehensively change our health care system PERIOD

Moreover I find it disingenuous that Republicans demand bipartisanship even though their opposition to health care reform is grounded in partisan politics PERIOD What was constructive disagreement for refining policy has disintegrated into disagreement for its own sake PERIOD Furthermore the opponents of reform are the people who already have great coverage the wealthy who are being asked to help pay for the changes and the participants in the health care system who might be financially affected PERIOD

Many observers have rightly pointed out the hypocrisy of the Republicans railing against government interference by asking whether any of them are willing to give up their governmentprovided health care coverage PERIOD Obama is only trying to provide the American people health care comparable to that enjoyed by members of Congress PERIOD

The concept of granting extensive medical care to a portion of the population based on their wealth and position while limiting care to the less welltodo is morally unjust PERIOD Smokingrelated deaths diabetes obesityrelated diseases heart disease and drug addictions take a far greater toll on the lower economic classes PERIOD Yet our health care system abandons those same people because they cannot afford coverage PERIOD Proponents of universal health care should not fight for it out of partisanship but out of basic humanity and compassion for others PERIOD Is it morally acceptable for an advanced society in the twenty-first century to allow its less welloff citizens to suffer for the sake of partisan politics and monetary gains of a few
