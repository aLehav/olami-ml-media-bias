Capital Universitys production of Hey Look A Kids Show For Kids will take you on a wild ride through your childhood revisiting many of the classic stories and fairy tales while putting an environmentally green spin on them PERIOD All of the material from the show including the script was created by the cast as they went along PERIOD

Led and directed by Capitals own Dan Heaton this show takes characters we know and love and develops a deeper more encompassing storyline for them as we learn about the realities of pollution in our world PERIOD



We see classic characters such as Bigfoot the big bad wolf the three little pigs Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk and even the beanstalk itself all play critical roles for the story PERIOD However the plot is driven by original characters Princess Rosemary her evil mother and Marv the marvelous wizard PERIOD

We had our environmental theme but none of the script had been written yet Heaton said PERIOD The theme of helping the environment was our motivation and pushed the show. as the shows title suggests it is a performance that was made for children PERIOD It is done in a way that not only relates to them and their interests but it also is comprehensible for them PERIOD This is not to say that the performance is unenjoyable for an older audience though as the cast was able to marvelously lace in quick jabs and jokes that would make anyone laugh PERIOD

Im excited for the kids to see this Dominique McIntyre the actor who plays Granny Grains said PERIOD But Im also excited because there are some dad jokes in the show so Im excited for those older people to laugh and be like Oh that was funny PERIOD I see what you did there. the cast will get the opportunity to perform the show in front of an audience filled with their target audience children as they travel to the Columbus Montessori Education center Friday morning PERIOD

As for the rest of their performances the Cabaret Theatre is transformed time and time again throughout this show with bright vibrant yellows greens and pinks consistent in the background and props PERIOD Thanks to the guidance of Sharon Croft the costume designer for the show all of the characters are believably what they claim to be as they all pass the eye test from the very first moment the lights go out and the curtain rises PERIOD



The idea of creating an entire play from scratch was enticing to the cast members but it did provide some challenges along the way PERIOD

Its been a process bigfoot actor Nate LaGuardia said PERIOD At first I wasnt too sure PERIOD I was a little bit nervous about it because we got to be two to three weeks in and we still didnt even have a script PERIOD Normally we are off book by then  but its been a fun and interesting challenge. this show seems to have it all humor talent cute and adorable interactions between characters an important message driving the plot and an overall ability to leave a smile on the faces of all audience members in attendance PERIOD Youll have the pollution solution stuck in your head for days after seeing this performance but maybe thats the point PERIOD

Showings for Hey Look A Kids Show For Kids will be at  p.m PERIOD on Thursday Friday and Saturday evening with a final showing at  p.m PERIOD on Sunday afternoon PERIOD All performances will take place in the Cabaret Theatre which is located in the basement of the student union PERIOD Students can reserve tickets at the box office in the Cabaret Theatre for free by providing their student ID PERIOD
