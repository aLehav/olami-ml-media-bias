Earlier this week the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority MBTA unveiled a budget plan that is alarming at best PERIOD According to The Boston Globe the MBTA wants to suspend all weekend commuter rail service for a year and cut tens of thousands of doortodoor rides for passengers with disabilities PERIOD

The T is constantly under fire whether its dealing poorly with wintry conditions experiencing changeup at its highest management levels or alarming Orange Line passengers with smoking train cars PERIOD Its safe to say that Bay Staters dont have warm feelings toward their public transit service PERIOD

However the proposed cuts this time are indicative of a larger problem with the T PERIOD Although it is meant to be a public service it has largely been developed to operate better in more affluent areas rather than workingclass residential neighborhoods PERIOD

When a winter storm hits service is most impacted at the ends of the train lineswhere lowincome Bostonians reside PERIOD The centers of the lines around Back Bay and Beacon Hill typically remain functional PERIOD Many MBTA services help suburban communities like Newton where the median household income was  in  according to CityData.com PERIOD

Last spring when the MBTA originally proposed fare hikes that were implemented in July Mark Pothier opined in The Boston Globe that the system was not designed with affordability in mind PERIOD

There are reduced fares for seniors students and the disabled but the majority of customers pay the same admission fee Pothier wrote PERIOD It doesnt matter whether theyre going to corporate headquarters or going to clean the home of someone who works at corporate headquarters. so when the T proposes that the commuter rail shut down entirely for nearly  percent of the week there are people who can no longer afford to go into or out of the city PERIOD If those people are workers a number of things beyond transportation will become unaffordable as well PERIOD

According to May  statistics from Keolis Commuter Services the company that runs the commuter rail trains provided about  trips heading toward Boston on Saturdays and  on Sundays PERIOD While the company did not provide numbers on outbound trips in its report during fiscal  about  trips were recorded on Saturdays and about  on Sundays PERIOD

Commonwealth Magazine points out that there is some confusion between the proposed numbers and the MBTAs communication with the public PERIOD For example an MBTA consultant said bus maintenance costs could be cut via the employment of private operators while retaining existing public workers at their current pay PERIOD However a private sector model was released a few days later that suggested savings would primarily come from job cuts PERIOD Additionally Gov PERIOD Charlie Bakers administration tends to focus on the staggering numbers of total costs rather than on the marginal cost of say adding a bus PERIOD

We need clearcut information PERIOD We need a shared understanding of what the MBTA is actually proposing PERIOD We do not need governmental agencies trying to justify sweeping cuts to essential services PERIOD The bottom line is that peoplereal individualsuse the services on the chopping block PERIOD Bostonarea workers take the commuter rail on weekends as do students visiting their families PERIOD Many people with disabilities especially those who are unable to afford special vehicles or other assistance rely on The Ride to get them from place to place PERIOD

Massachusetts Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said Monday that we must ask questions hard questions about what we want to run. we invite Pollack in return to ask questions about the very system we have in place PERIOD It is irresponsible to take away service from the individuals who need it most PERIOD Public transportation must serve the public PERIOD
