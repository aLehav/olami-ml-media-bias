OSU beat Nebraska OU beat Iowa State Notre Dame beat Air Force and I beat all hell out of everyone yet again PERIOD In fairness I picked Air Force and Oregon and they both lost  I guess the girls in The Big Duck are more than I bargained for  but I improved my record to  are you listening   wins  losses and only two truly bad picks PERIOD If youll recall I picked OSU to beat Nebraska though I did have one foot out the backdoor when said pick was made PERIOD



The first BCS poll came out this week and OU was ranked number one PERIOD



Predictors are saying that if OU Miami and Notre Dame all go undefeated it will be MiamiNotre Dame at which point Sooner Nation will officially storm the Fiesta Bowl while raping and pillaging everything and everyone in sight the picture of an idiotic OU Ruffneck hitting the idiotic Notre Dame mascot Ned Beattystyle is almost too much to comprehend PERIOD



Tulsa has its best shot at almost winning a game this week as they play UTEP PERIOD The El Paso squad has two wins which is two better than the lowly Hurricane PERIOD



After Saturday UTEP will get its third PERIOD



The Pokes and the Sooners both have the weekend off PERIOD May I ask why Theres not a lot to do in our Socialist State so why oh why must both good football teams be off on the same weekend Do David Boren and James Halligan have a dinner date in Tulsa or something Its the Dave and Jim show Dave Hey Jim I have a great idea  why dont you bring in a lowly junior college my retarded cousin Gomer got his PhD in astrostupidity from while I continue to add to our priceless art collection polish the Sears trophy increase our multibillion dollar endowment and our total favored son status in Oklahoma Jim Hey would you pass the sliced peanut butter please



Way off the subject though PERIOD To the picks the way it is the way it was the way it will be PERIOD



Miami plays West Virginia a college in a state that makes Oklahoma look like Monte Carlo in July that would be really good dumbass PERIOD West Virginia is decent but Miami is steamed that they just barely beat out Notre Dame for the second spot in the BCS PERIOD Miami by a hundred PERIOD



Notre Dame mirroring OUs run of  has turned into a lethal defense which lacks an offense something that is going to hurt them PERIOD



I pick against them every week on principle and this week is no different PERIOD Ill take an average Florida State team over a revived Notre Dame program every day of the week PERIOD FSU by  PERIOD



Fourthranked VaTech could get the club team and take down Temple by  PERIOD However the VaTech club team is really good PERIOD VaTech by  PERIOD



Georgia is on heavy upset alert right now PERIOD The Dogs made their appearance in the BCS at fifth this week and they go to the Bluegrass State motto We have bluegrass to take on Kentuckamucky PERIOD No upset this week PERIOD

Now for the upset PERIOD Ohio State is good but not as good as billed PERIOD



Ive said the team should be high as No PERIOD  but it is enduring a lot of close calls and this week its not playing Indiana PERIOD



Yes thats right the boys from Happy Valley  Paterno State  will beat Ohio State PERIOD Funniest of all  theyll do it handily PERIOD



Washington State will play at Arizona PERIOD Theyll lose PERIOD The second upset in as many picks PERIOD Arizona by  PERIOD



Michigan plays Iowa which should prove to be the most boringest game of the week PERIOD



Id pick it Michigan but I must ask one question does anyone care about Michigan until they play eternal whipping boy Ohio State Answer Nope PERIOD

Auburn Poke State of the South has a student body that could drink the average Irishman under the table and this weekend will be no different but while their livers may be worthless their effort will not be for naught PERIOD LSU by  PERIOD
