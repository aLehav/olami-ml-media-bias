Big changes have recently been made in the womens basketball department as new head coach Amanda Davied is taking center court to replace former head coach Lane Lord PERIOD After being an assistant coach since  Davied is taking over the reins and is thrilled to be moving into her new role PERIOD

Its a little surrealshe said PERIOD Coach High and then coach Lord allowed me to be involved in all facets of the team from day to day so nothing is really blowing my mind but its just a surreal feeling making all the decisions PERIOD We have camp next week so Im just really excited. prior to her 14year tenure as a full time assistant coach Davied received her undergraduate degree in physical education through Pittsburg State while playing on the team PERIOD While coaching she also received hermastersin physical education PERIOD Having already been with the team for so long she is looking forward to continuing her work with the team from last year as well as the incoming freshmen PERIOD

Im most looking forward to the team Davied said PERIOD The incoming players and the returning freshmen.We have a pretty big group returning and a lot of new good players coming in PERIOD Im excited to be a good leader for them and get confident in whats to come this next year. davied spread the news to her players as quickly as she could through a mixture of phone calls and meeting some of the more local players in person or making sure to catch up with them in passing PERIOD The team is just as excited as Davied is to get the year started with their new coach PERIOD

Im definitely excited senior shooting guard Shelby Lopez said PERIOD Im confident in all her abilities and what shes going to do with the program PERIOD Its going to be a nice position because shes been here so long and transitioned through all of the motions PERIOD Most of our players know her very well and we have the utmost confidence in her. as far as potential difficulties down the road given herexperienceDavied is confident in her abilities to face any difficulties head on PERIOD

We havent had any problems so far but Im sure there will be Davied said PERIOD Things come up all the time that youhaveto make decisions about quickly PERIOD There will bealot of questions coming my way PERIOD Itll all be coming full speed but Im ready for a change and a challenge and Im excited about my new role PERIOD I think the recruiting is going to be really important PERIOD As long as we have good people and good players that winning culture will continue PERIOD Recruiting is always a challenge but I think we have a great product at PittState that we will be able to recruit high quality people and players. the players are also ready to face any challenges that arise standing side by side with their coach PERIOD

This years going to have its challenges Lopez said PERIOD But its going to be exciting to be a part of a new basketball era atPitt State PERIOD I think it will be a good one PERIOD Im excited for the change and excited for the challenge as well. as far as what the future holdsDavied says that its hard to predictbut that the campus and community can still expectto see the sameteam they have come to know so well PERIOD

They can still expect a strong presence of the womens basketball program in the community Davied said PERIOD Were not going to change everything PERIOD I think they should feel comfortable that the programs going to remain the same PERIOD It was going the path that both of us wanted to so Im not sure that people should be expecting a lot of changes PERIOD We will still be a strong force in the classrooms the community on the floor PERIOD Were trying to keep this ship sailing exactly as it was before. alyssa Tyler copy editor On Sept PERIOD  at the Evergy Courtyard singersongwriter John Calvin Abney
