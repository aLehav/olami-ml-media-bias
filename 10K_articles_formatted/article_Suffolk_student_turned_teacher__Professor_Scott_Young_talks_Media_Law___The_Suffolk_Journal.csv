368,2016-06-08,"alumni Scott Young is no stranger to Suffolk University and is returning to campus as an adjunct of professor of media law PERIOD

According to the Suffolk website media law is described as a class that explores the legal rights responsibilities and constraints on the media and on media professionals PERIOD Focus on defamation copyright obscenity broadcast regulation and mediarelated tort law. young takes his role at Suffolk seriously as he was once on the other side of the classroom PERIOD Young is a  graduate who majored in broadcast journalism and film and is teaching the very same class where he discovered his love of law PERIOD

This media law course just might be what first made me think I would like to go into law said Young PERIOD At the end of the semester I was the only journalism major who really enjoyed it. young told a story of how he bumped into one of his old professors during his law school interview only to be told hed make a great teacher PERIOD When asked if there was a class he would ever want to teach at Suffolk Young responded with media law. after deciding to take the next steps to get his masters degree in law Young asked a friend if he should go to Suffolk or another school PERIOD She joked that he shouldnt go into law at all and instead to follow whichever school offered more money PERIOD Years into his program he met with her again and told her he chose the other university PERIOD This friend is now his wife and they just celebrated their two year anniversary PERIOD

In  Professor Deb Geisler Youngs former media law professor needed someone to fill in for her three weeks into the semester PERIOD Young had been in contact with Geisler after he got in touch two years into his program to thank her for what her class did for his life PERIOD Young took over and has been moonlighting at Suffolk ever since PERIOD

She left very big shoes to fill in a very important course said Young PERIOD

Young has since made the course his own PERIOD Though he based his syllabus off of his old professors he has made some amendments PERIOD

I want to cover all the important material for journalism students so they understand the legal standards that they have to know and teach them things that will empower them Young said PERIOD

He also stressed that it is important for law students to feel comfortable in the course and learn things like tort law which is described as an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability PERIOD

Media law is difficult because you cant move or teach it at the pace of a typical law class said Young PERIOD

During my first time teaching I could tell within the first  minutes who was a law major and who was a journalism major but now its a more mixed group said Young PERIOD

Young hopes to continue on at Suffolk while also working as a State House Legislative Staffer meaning he works for a member of the State Senate PERIOD His job includes handling media and government relations for a legislative office thats especially focused on climate and clean energy policy PERIOD

I would love to keep teaching adjunct maybe more classes or even workshops Young said PERIOD Im really excited and looking forward to seeing where this goes. follow Ashley on Twitter Ashleyfaichi14
