AJRs music video for their song  featuring Rivers Cuomo of Weezer was released on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

AJRS new music video for its song Sober Up released on Jan PERIOD  not only showcases the bands outsider personality but also clarifies the true meaning behind the song for fans giving it a more innocent and youthful feel PERIOD



The video starts out with the bands lead singer Jack roaming the streets of his hometown New York City PERIOD Its hard to notice but he passes by a reflection of himself in a mirror and a puddle twice without noticing it until the second time PERIOD When he notices it the second time in a random New Yorkers sunglasses he realizes that its not a reflection of his current self but actually a reflection of him back when he was a child PERIOD

Right off the bat that first interaction with the man in the sunglasses is not only humorous but shows off Jacks carefree childlike personality PERIOD The man is clearly weirded out by Jack but Jack doesnt seem to even notice the New Yorkers judgy attitude or seem to be embarrassed by his actions PERIOD

The contrast between the personality of AJR and the rest of the world is a common theme seen in their music videos such as Im Not Famous and Come Hang Out. these contrasts always add a comedic twist to their music videos but also add to the character of the band  listeners can already tell from their music style that they are definitely not the typical kind of musicians PERIOD These interactions in their music videos go to show that they are not the typical kind of celebrities either PERIOD



Jack then goes on to stare at his reflection in the window of a building in NYC and appears to have a series of mixed emotions cycling between confused intrigued and kind of freakedout PERIOD He then goes to a stand selling mirrors and begins to do dorky little dance moves in front of the mirrors with the younger version of himself doing the same moves in the mirror PERIOD All of the sudden his younger reflection waves goodbye to Jack and runs away sending the lead singer on a wild goose chase to try to find the younger version of himself PERIOD

Through the music video the band clears up any misinterpretations fans might have had about the song PERIOD Lyrics like Wont you help me sober up Growing up made me numb and I want to feel something again are somewhat nostalgic references to feelings of freedom associated with you PERIOD Unfortunately when fans are just casually listening through the song its fairly easy for them to overlook those nostalgic references and just focus on the lyrics like All the big kids they got drunk and We smiled at party time but soon we forget to smile at anything else PERIOD Because of this some might assume that the song is about partying becoming a way for them and other adults to ignore their unhappiness PERIOD

While that may be a point to be made somewhere in the song the music video uses the serious streets of NYC and the child reflection to show an even deeper meaning PERIOD When the band is talking about sobering up it doesnt necessarily mean sobering up from drinking  it means sobering up from all the weight of growing up PERIOD The band is asking for help from its childself who knows how to live without worry rather than from a significant other or best friend PERIOD

Additionally with the music video taking place in NYC it not only creates a contrast that shows the bands personality but makes the viewer think about the differences between the seriousness of adult life and lightheartedness of childhood PERIOD NYC is the city that will make you or break you  its pretty tough out there PERIOD Sometimes all that toughness can make people pretty bitter which is why they need sobering up from the brutality of the real world PERIOD

The music video ends with the lead singer looking into a puddle with the reflection of the child version of himself PERIOD As the camera moves upward to reveal him looking at the reflection we see that it is no longer the adult version of himself but the child version of himself PERIOD

With that being the closing moment the audience is left with a mood thats even more reflective than the puddle Jack had been staring into PERIOD It seems that the lead singer is off to live out his life with the free spirit attitude of his childself and leaves us wondering if maybe we should do the same PERIOD
