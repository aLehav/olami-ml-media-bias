Updated November     pm



The Supreme Court said it will decide whether the Justice Department may bar Oregon doctors from prescribing lethal doses of drugs to terminally ill patients who have chosen to die under that states 11yearold Death With Dignity Act PERIOD

The court said it will review a lower courts decision preventing enforcement of a November  statement of Justice Department policy by thenAttorney General John Ashcroft PERIOD The directive said that assisting suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose under federal drugcontrol law and that the Drug Enforcement Administration could strip the prescribing rights of any physician who authorized drugs to help someone die PERIOD

Ashcrofts directive overturned a  decision by President Bill Clintons attorney general Janet Reno to permit Oregon doctors to assist in suicides PERIOD

The courts decision sets the stage for a battle next fall over an issue that for years has bitterly divided Americans between those who say physicianassisted suicide is often the only option terminally ill patients have to end their suffering and those who say it amounts to homicide PERIOD
