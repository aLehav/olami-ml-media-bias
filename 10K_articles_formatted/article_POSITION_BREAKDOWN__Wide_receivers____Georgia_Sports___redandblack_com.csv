Outlook Everyone is wondering how Georgia will replace former wide receiver A.J PERIOD Green who was drafted fourth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals PERIOD The truth is the Bulldogs cant PERIOD Greens ability cant be matched by any one receiver on this years roster but the Bulldogs may be able make up for his absence with their depth PERIOD

Marlon Brown Rantavious Wooten Malcolm Mitchell Tavares King Israel Troupe and Chris Conley who offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said are his top six wideouts are all more than capable of making plays PERIOD Brown and Wooten both juniors have had excellent camps and are expected to have breakout seasons PERIOD Mitchell a true freshman has impressed everybody in camp with his great speed and natural ability PERIOD Conley is another true freshman expected to contribute to the offense not quite at the level Mitchell canbut Conley has the talent to compete for a lot of playing time PERIOD

Troupe is a senior who prior to camp was not expected to perform at a high level this season after catching just three passes last year in nine games PERIOD But Troupes efforts in camp and in recent scrimmages are earning him some attention in a receiving corp that lost its top two players from last year in Green and Kris Durham PERIOD

Position Stalwart After Green and Durham Georgias next leading receiver last season was the junior King with  yards PERIOD King has gotten somewhat lost in the wide receiver discussion due to the attention given to the young talent and potential breakout years at the position PERIOD Even if King is eventually outshined by a guy like Mitchell or Wooten his experience is critical to the otherwise unproven group of receivers PERIOD

Surprise Performer Malcolm Mitchells speed and talent are undeniable and everyone knows it PERIOD Not many could predict however that he would be as good as he has been this early PERIOD Mitchell has impressed coaches and his fellow players in camp and has worked his way near the top of a deep rotation of receivers PERIOD Expect Mitchell to contribute with big plays right away this year and expect Bobo to get the ball in the speedy receivers hands in a variety of ways with bubble screens reverses and long balls PERIOD

Depth Wooten said when asked about losing Green and Durham to the NFL that this years squad is  despite the lack of a superstar.There is no A.J PERIOD Green leading the corps but Georgia has six solid wide outs and quarterback Aaron Murray will enjoy spreading the ball around to them PERIOD

 Murray said PERIOD 

The depth at the position does depend however on how much Mitchell and Conley are able to contribute as freshmen and whether Brown and Wooten can turn good camps into good seasons PERIOD
