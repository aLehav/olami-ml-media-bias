Carolina Hurricanes goalie Aanti Raanta passes the puck during the game against the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday April   in PNC Arena PERIOD Raanta had a total of  saves during the game PERIOD The Hurricanes lost to the Red Wings  PERIOD

Theres less than  games left of the regular NHL season PERIOD While the Carolina Hurricanes  have already clinched a playoff spot they still sit just two points ahead of the New York Rangers in the Metro Division standings PERIOD

As the regular season winds down and the playoff picture gets drawn up lets take a look at these last few days of Canes hockey and discuss some key takeaways for the rest of the regular season PERIOD

Lighting the lamp

The Hurricanes success on offense continues to be one of their greatest strengths heading down the stretch PERIOD

Right wing Andrei Svechnikov and center Sebastian Aho have continued their great seasons as of late with Aho leading the team in goals and points PERIOD Svechnikov has five points in the last five games while Aho has nine points in the month of April including a twogoal game against the Buffalo Sabres on April  PERIOD

Defenseman Brady Skjei has also made an impact as of late with five points since April  PERIOD Center Max Domi the Canes lone addition at the trade deadline also joined in on the scoring action with a twopoint performance against the Arizona Coyotes April  including his first goal for Carolina PERIOD

Center Jordan Staal has been another notable name riding a hot streak in April with eight goals including a hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks on April  and two more goals against the Coyotes PERIOD

The depth throughout the lineup and the ability to score no matter who is on the ice has brought Carolina to where it sits right now and can carry the team through the postseason so long as its defense stays strong as well PERIOD

Goaltending depth getting tested

Goaltenders Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta anchored the Canes in net for much of the season PERIOD This netminding duo has been a large part of what has made this team so successful PERIOD

Andersen had an AllStarcaliber season up until February where his play dropped off after a weeklong break in the schedule to start the month PERIOD Andersen only let up  goals in  games before that stretch but has already allowed  goals in just  games since then PERIOD He also sustained an injury that required him to be helped off the ice at the tail end of his most recent appearance on April  PERIOD While there havent been many details released about that lowerbody injury hes expected to be out at least a week PERIOD

In response Carolina called up goalie Pyotr Kochetkov from the Chicago Wolves who has a  record with a . save percentage in the AHL PERIOD

The Canes have recalled G Pyotr Kochetkov the reigning AHL Rookie of the Month from the ChicagoWolves httpst.co2Iovzeg1S6

Kochetkov has yet to make his NHL debut but the Canes need Andersen back quickly to have any hope of winning the Metro and advancing past the first round of the playoffs PERIOD The Hurricanes will also hope that Andersen looks closer to his earlyseason form when he returns PERIOD

Dinged up down the stretch

Aside from Andersen Staal and center Jesperi Kotkaniemi have been banged up as well PERIOD

Both injuries seem to be daytoday so its possible Kotkaniemi Staal or both see the ice in the Hurricanes next matchup against the Winnipeg Jets on April  PERIOD These two are huge pieces of the lineup that Carolina would hope to have back sooner rather than later PERIOD

Trips to the box

Another recent struggle for the Hurricanes is their inability to stay out of the penalty box PERIOD

In the past five games alone Carolina has been on the penalty kill  times PERIOD While their PK unit ranks best in the league the team cant keep giving its opponents easier chances to score especially with recent instability in the net PERIOD

For continued success down the road the Canes need to clean up their game and keep five skaters on the ice PERIOD

The final countdown

Carolina has just two more games at home in the regular season against the Jets and the New Jersey Devils while it hits the road for the other three games in between PERIOD

One of those away games includes a matchup against the Rangers who are currently battling Carolina for first place in the Metro division PERIOD

The Hurricanes hold a slim twopoint lead over the Rangers so all five of Carolinas remaining games will hold importance as the Canes fight to stay on top and secure a higher seed on their road to the Stanley Cup Final PERIOD
