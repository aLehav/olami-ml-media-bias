Interpol  Interpol

Label Matador Records

Everything wonderful about Interpol had faded by their  majorlabel debut Our Love to Admire. the cold urban isolation so heavily rooted in their early postpunk ways had been sacrificed for a collection of lazy hooks PERIOD Simply put they got boring PERIOD
Their newly released renaissance on Matador Records not only marks a satisfying return to form but also a surprising growth PERIOD On their enthralling new selftitled release crescendos seem to be the name of the game PERIOD
The bands trademarks are undoubtedly in tact PERIOD The slow fuzzy guitar riffs keep the first  seconds of each song barely discernable from the next PERIOD The textured lines from now defunct bassist Carlos Dengler act as the crux for the majority of tracks PERIOD The latter fact is greatly disheartening because of how outstanding the group sounds as a collective on this record PERIOD Frontman Paul Banks vocals now carry monumental wails over the slowpaced albeit cacophonic heights PERIOD On the selfless romantic track Memory Serves Banks has never sounded better as he howls It would be no price to pay. to think that such a satisfying record could come immediately prior to Denglers exit paves a nervous path for the future PERIOD At least we were shown one last satisfying hurrah from one of the central bands of the last decade PERIOD

The Walkmen  Lisbon
Label Fat Possum


What an interesting footing The Walkmen have found over the last two albums PERIOD 2008s You  Me introduced newfound warmth to a band that became distractingly cold PERIOD
Lisbon only adds to this collection of sunnier songs PERIOD While it may not expand into the new territories that You  Me did the album continues to build on this frustrated romanticism where they left off PERIOD
Their greatest strength remains their punctuated fervor PERIOD On Angela Surf City lead singer Hamilton Leithauser toys with apathetic lyrics Angela Whats the difference Todays a day like any other. such silly musings are only shattered when the frenetic band kicks in with rolling snares over Leithausers sincerely scorned screams PERIOD
Again The Walkmens appeal heavily rests on the percussive talent of Matt Barrick PERIOD Yet the groundwork of You  Me is still present in the simpler tracks relying heavily on bass guitar lines PERIOD The penultimate track While I Shovel Snow demonstrates their capacity for letting the strings carry the quieter weight PERIOD Once again its a decision that adds to that California warmth at the colder points PERIOD
Make no mistake The Walkmen are likely only an album away from some necessary growth PERIOD Maybe its the fall releases that have made the cozier sounds that much more appealing PERIOD Regardless The Walkmen have seemingly found the ideal sound for the hopeless romantic PERIOD At least for now there is no reason to complain PERIOD
