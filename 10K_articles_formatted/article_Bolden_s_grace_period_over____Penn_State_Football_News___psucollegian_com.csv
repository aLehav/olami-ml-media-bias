622,1970-01-01,"iOWA CITY Iowa  In Division I college football theres a grace period for young quarterbacks.The transition from high school to the collegiate level isnt an easy one PERIOD The game is quicker the playbook is thicker and perhaps most importantly the pressure is greater.In Happy Valley this year for a true freshman replacing an allconference quarterback who led the Lions to their first Rose Bowl in  years it would be unfair to criticize early in the season.Such is the case for young Rob Bolden who  months ago was tearing up high school defenses in the Catholic League in Michigan PERIOD Within the last four weeks he started games in Tuscaloosa against defending national champion Alabama and in a cold hostile Kinnick Stadium for Iowas homecoming game.Both losses were far from Boldens fault and given the mandatory grace period its only fair to be lenient when assessing his performance.Rob Bolden your grace period is about to end.The offenses woes through the first five weeks of the season can hardly be attributed to Bolden PERIOD The offensive line is completely reshuffled the run game is stagnant and  at least on Saturday  the wide receivers had a case of the drops.Through five games the only real complaint about Bolden has been his play in the red zone PERIOD Between the 20s he leads drives like a veteran and fits balls between defenders with precision.But in the two losses red zone play has been Boldens downfall PERIOD Coming up inches short on a thirdquarter 4thandgoal scramble is perhaps the play that epitomizes those struggles.I think we may be asking too much of the freshman Joe Paterno said of calling Boldens number at what proved to be the games turning point.But hes more than a freshman PERIOD Rob Bolden is a starting quarterback at a footballcrazed university.Five weeks into the season its time to start treating him as the latter PERIOD Sure hes a rookie but how many other rookies have been through what Boldens been throughHe broke JoePas antifreshman precedent by becoming the first true freshman to start a season at quarterback under the legendary coach.Hes started games in two of the loudest environments in the country.And he led a crucial 96yard gameclinching touchdown drive against an intrastate rival that included multiple completions on third down.I really think he did a good job senior cocaptain Brett Brackett said when asked what Bolden could have done to improve on his Iowa performance PERIOD Hes a true freshman quarterback coming into an environment like this theres not much else you can do.Brackett wont  and probably shouldnt  criticize his quarterback to the media PERIOD That doesnt mean hes right when he says theres nothing Bolden could have done differently.Bolden could probably be a little more in control of the play clock and he could probably look a little smoother in the pocket when hes facing pressure.Thats not to say hes not doing a good job just that he has flaws  like every football player does PERIOD Theyre flaws he and quarterbacks coach Jay Paterno have probably already pinpointed on film and are working on correcting.He kept his composure through the adversity and through the crowd said senior tackle Quinn Barham who then offered perhaps the lone critique of Bolden through the seasons first month PERIOD We did have problems hearing him but we worked with that  theres only so much he can do and then its up to us to take responsibility.Barham is on the mark with that assessment PERIOD Right now the Oline and the run game take precedent over switching some small imperfections in Boldens game.But hes been to Tuscaloosa hes been to Iowa and hes the most talked about man in Happy Valley.For a quarterback who will likely go on to a brilliant career at Penn State its time to stop pretending those imperfections dont exist PERIOD Andrew J PERIOD Cassavell is a senior majoring in journalism and is a Collegian football writer PERIOD His email address is ajc5238psu.edu  PERIOD
