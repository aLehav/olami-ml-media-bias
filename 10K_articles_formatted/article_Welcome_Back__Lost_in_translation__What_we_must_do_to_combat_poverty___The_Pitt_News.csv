The apparent disparity of income inequality among low and highincome families in the United States is at an alltime high PERIOD Income inequality or poverty to be exact is one of the most deprecating issues hindering society and for decades now little has been done to reverse the trend PERIOD

Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children WIC and Supplemental Security Income SSI are all directed to helping those in need particularly those troubled by a serious gap in income resources and education from their wealthier more adept counterparts PERIOD

These programs along with an assortment of smaller federal and state assistance programs support a compelling case for some a purported behemoth of tax dollars go to a replete of programs aiding the poor leaving little reason for the federal government to do anything more than what they have already promised PERIOD After all these tax dollarsucking poor people live comfortably while the rest of society foots the bill right

Cue slew of misconceptions andmisguided stereotypes PERIOD

The problem doesnt lie in the number of programs that Washington and state governments implement to help the needy nor is it an issue that the impoverished are sucking our tax dollars that could be put to other programs  thats just fallacious PERIOD It isnt even an issue of how much is appropriated to these programs  not yet at least PERIOD

Two problems lie within public assistance programs the inefficient sieve these programs become when they attempt to determine who is eligible for benefits and theinfrastructure of these policies which all share similarities albeit intended to assist different demographics facing differing situations PERIOD These programs are identical in that they fall short because for one their eligibility requirements fail to account for swaths of individuals whom are in dire need of help but are ineligible for certain types of benefits PERIOD What is troublesome about this is that while they neglect such constituencies these programs continue to toutthe same slogans helping the impoverished make ends meet PERIOD That just isnt true

So given these programs inability to correctly account for the impoverished and that their infrastructure collectively fails to alleviate the burdens of food insecurity and poverty how can they be reformed appropriately In short emphasizing the need foreducation PERIOD Its been argued before but little has been reformed to tend to the necessary skills individuals need to alleviate the shackles of poverty in an effort to climb the social mobility ladder PERIOD

Education is the single most important factor that determines whether those in poverty will ever leave poverty PERIOD Although a few tenets in assistance programs address the development of skills and expertise necessary to be competitive in a cutthroat workforce they are inefficient Instead of recognizing that skill development is necessary to ensure economic progress assistance programs throw money at a constituency unproductively PERIOD

First the central premise of these programs must change PERIOD It shouldnt be to just lift the hold poverty imposes on the lives of unfortunate individuals but to educate them in an effort to ensure their children  and their childrens children  arent further suffocated by poverty PERIOD

As the war on povertys first crusader President Lyndon B PERIOD Johnson said The cause of poverty may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities in a lack of education and training in a lack of medical care and housing in a lack of decent communities in which to live and bring up their children. poverty is all around us

Poverty is formally defined as a dearth in the usual or socially acceptable amount of money and tangible assets PERIOD According to the United States Census Bureau approximately  percent  or about  million Americans  fit the description of poverty PERIOD But the Census Bureaus largely inaccurate method of arriving at that statistic has long been criticized PERIOD By using the newer more efficient measure called the Supplemental Poverty Measure SPM the poverty rate in the United States reaches  percent  or about  million Americans  as noted by poverty expert and Columbia professor Stephen Pimpare PERIOD

While to some that may seem unconcerning poverty has reached more than  percent of Americans PERIOD The issue with the Census Bureaus calculation lies within its name in fact PERIOD The census surveys individuals at a singular point in time and it doesnt account for the fluctuating financial state of millions PERIOD As Pimpare notes by looking at data on how many Americans were in poverty for at least two months from  to  the percentage of Americans faced with poverty exponentiates to . percent PERIOD That statistic alone is astounding because not only does that mean far more Americans have experienced poverty but the country with one of the highest rates of economic production average household income and standard of living also is home to one of the highest number of impoverished individuals for a developed country PERIOD

Zooming in the poverty rate in Allegheny County reflects similarly troubling numbers PERIOD Currently approximately . percent  or just over  individuals  face poverty in Allegheny County PERIOD In the  zip code which houses communities such as Pitt and Oakland  people currently are enrolled in SNAP more commonly known as food stamps PERIOD

The issue of poverty evidently isnt one that is abstract or distant or only a concern for thirdworld countries but rather it is a rampant pressing concern that affects everyone including our neighbors  and perhaps even ourselves PERIOD

Not giving enough

Assistance programs such as TANF SNAP and WIC arent entirely ineffective policies PERIOD Contrary to the innumerable misconceptions that plague these programs the benefits those in poverty receive are finite PERIOD For unemployed beneficiaries strict restrictions are in place that incentivize individuals to obtain employment PERIOD Furthermore most of these programs are not welfare PERIOD In fact they are lines of defense to prevent individuals from enrolling in welfare PERIOD

For a program such as SNAP for every dollar the federal government pays for the program up to . is returned back to the economy PERIOD These programs also assist in Americas future The largest beneficiary of many of these programs is children PERIOD So yes these programs are laudable  to an extent PERIOD

TANF for instance is an assistance program that helps families struggling to stay afloat and live healthily by offering benefits such as expendable cash and healthcare services PERIOD Although TANF is a program upon which many people heavily depend the largest discrepancy with TANF is that the programs funding hasnt adjusted for inflation in  years diminishing the overall value of the funds by  percent PERIOD What is more TANF fails to address the shocking barriers to employment to which those in poverty are subjugated PERIOD In fact recipients make a compelling case for why education should be the top priority amongst these assistance programs  many TANF recipients are reported to face more than one barrier to employment PERIOD In  alone

 percent of recipients had no high school diploma or GED equivalent PERIOD

. percent had no drivers license or car PERIOD

 percent had a major depressive disorder PERIOD

. percent had a child with a health learning or emotional problem PERIOD

These statistics show why educating the impoverished is crucial in seeing any real progress with regard to eradicating poverty PERIOD TANF includes some job training for its beneficiaries but that is far from enough to make any real difference in the lives of millions of Americans who have been systematically marginalized PERIOD If funds are allocated to programs that incentivize individuals to obtain more skills for employment than what a minimum wage job demands the probability of economic prosperity could increase PERIOD

One step forward two steps back

Its hard to imagine that poverty is more apparent in our peripheral than we would like to imagine but that gives us no better reason to fix what we see as broken on a daily basis PERIOD Although unproductive policies prolong the issues many of these families and individuals face we can take some solace in knowing that more people are realizing how to potentially lower the number of impoverished individuals in the United States PERIOD That is absolutely a positive sign for the fight against poverty PERIOD

Unfortunately it seems that Washington is no more likely to pass any sort of reform to programs such as TANF WIC or SNAP than they are likely to pass something such as immigration reform PERIOD But there has been visible progress on the local and state levels PERIOD History however disagrees Similar conclusions were made with marriage equality and now the United States is on the brink of having half of its states recognize samesex marriage as a legitimate form of matrimony PERIOD

Moreover recent movement in Washington is encouraging PERIOD Congressman Paul Ryans discussion draft outlining new approaches to maximizing the efficiency of public assistance programs has begun a discourse for action PERIOD Though the plan does call for increased spending on crucial programs such as Earned Income Tax Credit EITC  which is a refundable tax credit for lowincome employed individuals  it leaves large responsibilities to states to enforce individualized programs for their constituents PERIOD

One example of this is the implementation of block grants PERIOD As a plus creating block grants could provide states with added flexibility in appropriating funds which is especially helpful during times of recession when the number of individuals in need of assistance typically increases PERIOD Whats more block grants can also simplify the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for public benefits as echoed by many of those in the process PERIOD Yet the implementation of these grants and the increased responsibility state governments will subsequently exercise is ultimately a very neglectful stance on poverty PERIOD Shifting all of this responsibility from the federal government to each state relying on them to help their impoverished constituents is skeptical at the very least PERIOD Why When many of these states refuse to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act denying millions of Americans health coverage how confident would the average lowincome family be that their state will help them climb out of poverty

Separate from this block grants have a dangerous reputation when it comes to doling out funds to needy individuals PERIOD In the past block grants have not adjusted for inflation or efficiently met the needs of the given population PERIOD

Looking forwardwhat is to be made of the antipoverty legislative reform is uncertain PERIOD On one end advocacy groups and communitybased enterprises will continue to work tirelessly to enact changes to effectively limit the number of impoverished individuals in their community PERIOD While these advocates move forward and make progress national political polarization looms engendering a defatigable fight against poverty PERIOD Considering the overall neglect of the underprivileged and the spewing of misconstrued notions and stigmas circulating poverty the probability to enact any version of legislative reform in the immediate future is dismal PERIOD Sadly the only thing guaranteed is political lethargy PERIOD

As CEO of Gallup Jim Clifton puts it We cannot win the war for good jobs without the inclusion of and capacity building of the poor. write to Ankur at emailprotected
