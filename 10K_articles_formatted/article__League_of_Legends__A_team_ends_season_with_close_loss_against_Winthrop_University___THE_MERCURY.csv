The League of Legends A Team recently ended
their College League of Legends tournament run with a loss against Winthrop
University at quarterfinals in a close  series PERIOD

The Comets closing series against Winthrop was
the climax of a constantly changing season of League of Legends. the College
League of Legends tournament is the regular season for collegiate League
play with the various conferences organized by Riot Games leading up to the
CLoL finals PERIOD A unique part of the tournament is its play on live patches
unlike pro play where patches are delayed PERIOD Because of this the team is forced
to adapt to metashifting changes constantly with healthcare management senior
and team captain Jonathan Texas Baadsgaard saying that the team switched
focus on which lane to play from throughout the season PERIOD

I think we went through a lot of changes when
we first started this season Baadsgaard said PERIOD We were playing more towards
the bot side with our team comps and that was pretty successful in scrims but
I think every single time a patch would hit something would change
significantly that we werent really used to. throughout each patch from . through . the latter being the last patch on which the team played meta champions were
continually nerfed while others were buffed significantly PERIOD Various champions
including bot lane champions Aphelios and Senna top lane Soraka and Ornn rose
to significance with Riot making larger balance changes to try and keep the
game healthy PERIOD While the Comets had large periods of improvement throughout the
shifting tides of the metagame Baadsgaard said it was difficult to stay on the
track of continual improvement PERIOD

I think that one of the things that we could
definitely improve on is when we have that spike of improvement to try and
maintain that  you want to be at that level always Baadsgaard said PERIOD You
dont want to just go through a loss and then experience that huge spike in
improvement and then it kind of goes down again eventually. the Comets were able to fight through to the
quarterfinals by sticking to a popular team composition strategy of drafting
scaling teamfightoriented teams to outplay the enemy whenever friendly
ultimates are available Baadsgaard said PERIOD Popular champions with the team were
Aatrox and Sett for top lane Jarvan IV and Sejuani for jungle Leblanc and Zoe
for mid lane and mages for the bot side including Heimerdinger and Veigar PERIOD

We found that playing those AP mages actually
was a huge benefit PERIOD It was really hard to play bot side as the enemy
Baadsgaard said PERIOD And Sharpe whos our midlaner whos insane  wed definitely
just let him choose whatever it is that he wanted to do PERIOD Like if he wanted to
play Zoe wed say pick Zoe right now we dont care. although they were eventually knocked out by
Winthrop in the quarterfinals it was in a close backandforth match PERIOD Winthrop
and UTD played against each other until a score of  when in the last game
Winthrop pulled out a XayahRakan combination in the bottom lane to throw off
UTDs draft PERIOD This led to UTD drafting suboptimal champions and losing to
Winthrop in the draft which contributed to their ultimate loss PERIOD Despite this
the Winthrop series was Baadsgaards favorite series of the season because of
all of the buildup and when the game reached its silver scrapes moment or
when a league series reaches its maximum number of games PERIOD

I really liked watching Winthrop vs PERIOD UTD
Baadsgaard said PERIOD I thought that it was really exciting especially on game five
or like silver scrapes is going and 
all that buildup to that game was fun to not only be a part of but also to
watch back as a viewer. for the Comets the season is over for now PERIOD
But even with coronavirus shutting down much of the scene including CLoL
itself theres still games to be played in the future and Baadsgaard said
hes grateful to the team and for the experience PERIOD

I really started this out as just something
that I could prove to myself something that I could show that I really can
compete at a certain level  and Im grateful for my team for backing me up and
supporting me when I wasnt that good and helping me get to the point where I
was Baadsgaard said PERIOD
