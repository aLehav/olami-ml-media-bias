The FPA a nonprofit selfsupporting organization supplies foods and various other products to  State College area fraternities as well as civic and nonprofit organizations at the lowest possible price said FPA Manager Steve Fluder PERIOD

The association serves as a liaison between the fraternities and other organizations and the local vendors said Glenn Hartz student FPA chairman PERIOD

Because the fraternities go through the association the businesses know they will be paid Madio said PERIOD

Madio also said the businesses now deliver directly to the groups PERIOD In the past they delivered products to the FPA warehouse and the association would make the deliveries PERIOD
