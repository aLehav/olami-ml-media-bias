Megan Patierno of the Hofstra Pride softball squad is seeing a rise in production despite a major position change this season PERIOD 
The junior third baseman hadnt recorded much playing time at the hot corner prior to this season PERIOD
I came in to Hofstra as a shortstop Patierno said PERIOD I had played half a season at third base in high school but thats it PERIOD The Hofstra coaching staff had me working there a little last year and they started pushing me there this fall PERIOD I had to learn to play the position so I could play in the spring. the Pride signed talented freshman Kristin Hallam to play shortstop this season PERIOD So Patierno had to slide over to third and learn on the fly giving her some fits at the position from time to time PERIOD
Shortstop and third are actually really different in terms of reaction mostly Patierno said PERIOD At shortstop you have more time to think and react PERIOD You can know where youre going to go before you even get the ball just because of the speed and direction of the ball PERIOD At third base the ball can be ripped at you down the line as fast as you can get your glove there. the New Jersey native has a . fielding percentage at the position this year but has made a lot of tough plays and appears to be getting a handle on the role PERIOD 
Despite the positional change Patierno has made a lot of progress with the bat PERIOD After hitting . her freshman season and . her sophomore campaign shes up to . this year PERIOD Shes already slugged seven homers on the season PERIOD Patierno has learned a lot about college softball during her time at Hofstra PERIOD
Freshman year youre trying to figure everything out Patierno said PERIOD Sophomore year youre still trying to figure things out PERIOD But I think it comes down to knowing you have to make adjustments quicker PERIOD You realize how good everyone else is and if you dont hit youre out. patierno was known as a force at the plate coming out of high school PERIOD The junior broke her high school singleseason home run record with  long balls PERIOD For her it was just a matter of getting it to translate to games PERIOD 
You cant force home runs but a lot of it has to do with being more aggressive Patierno said PERIOD Just waiting for them to mess up and then you jump all over it. patierno and the Pride are  on the year and  in the CAA good for second place in the conference PERIOD The team is on a sevengame winning streak PERIOD
This year has been a really special year for us PERIOD I think the chemistry is great and its really fun to play with these girls PERIOD I think a lot of it has to do with work ethic Patierno said PERIOD Our incoming freshmen whether theyre the best players or not the best players they work as hard as everyone else PERIOD That kind of mends us together because theres no dropoff PERIOD Everyone is doing the same amount of work PERIOD It makes us respect each other more and we have more trust in each other. just like every player Patierno dreams of winning a conference title PERIOD With how she and the rest of the team are playing they should pose a threat to the Colonials top teams PERIOD
We know that we can win CAAs Patierno said PERIOD Weve known since the fall when we all got together and realized what kind of chemistry we all have together PERIOD If we play our best every single game well win CAAs. megan Patierno of the Hofstra Pride softball squad is seeing a rise in production despite a major position change this season PERIOD
