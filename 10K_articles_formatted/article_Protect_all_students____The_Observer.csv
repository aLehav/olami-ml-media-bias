Is this what it has come to for students to protect themselves off campus On Friday evening my house only two blocks from campus across Twyckenham had the front door kicked in by burglars who stole all the electronics in the house PERIOD Thankfully no one was home at the time and it didnt turn into another front page story of a student being held up at gunpoint PERIOD However we still lost  worth of laptops ipods cameras watches etc PERIOD and our sense of security PERIOD My question is What is Notre Dame doing to try to prevent or reduce these ever to frequent events from occurring For a University with a  billion endowment how much is the University spending to protect its students whom they no longer have room to house and live off campus Nothing or certainly not enough PERIOD

When there is a story of students getting robbed or assaulted every week its time for the University to step up and do something PERIOD It appears that the University is very concerned about improving relationships with the local community but how about the University doing something to protect its students who are victims of this increasingly dangerous community When the police are suggesting that students take security into their own hands by investing in a gun you know there is a real problem PERIOD Lets hope the University can pull the trigger on finding new and improved ways to protect its students who live off campus so I dont have to PERIOD
