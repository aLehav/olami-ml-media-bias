With the Big East championships less than two weeks away Georgetowns mens and womens swimming and diving team is set for a final tuneup against Maryland this Saturday PERIOD

The Hoyas hope to maintain the improvement they showed on senior night two Saturdays ago against George Washington PERIOD

I was really happy with that meet PERIOD We were very prepared and jumped out to a good start and kept it up Head Coach Jamie Holder said PERIOD

Since facing the Colonials Georgetown has started looking ahead to the Big East championships PERIOD

We are starting to taper down doing less yardage and focusing more on speed work Holder said PERIOD

Maryland is a more formidable foe than GWU but Holder views Saturdays meet as an opportunity to get into the pool for a final time before the team heads off to Louisville Ky. to meet Big East competition PERIOD

They are a very good team PERIOD We are looking to get some racing in and Maryland has a very nice facility Holder said PERIOD I dont care if we win or lose PERIOD We just want to get prepared. the Maryland meet is critical though to the swimmers who are still looking to achieve the results required for Big East tournament qualification PERIOD

We have three more swimmers to qualify on the guys side PERIOD Everyone is good with the divers and the womens side Holder said PERIOD They are well rested and are tapering for Saturday. after returning from College Park on Saturday the Hoyas have five days before the Big East diving championship kicks off on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Im excited for the Big East championships Holder said PERIOD I think people are starting to get sharper. hoya Staff Writer
