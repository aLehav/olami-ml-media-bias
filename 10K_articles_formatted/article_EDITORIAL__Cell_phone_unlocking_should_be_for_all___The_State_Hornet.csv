People should be able to use their property how they wish within reasonable limitations as long as people andor property are not damaged PERIOD

While this is the rule for most products one of the most glaring exceptions is how cell phones are often only allowed to be used within a certain carriers network PERIOD On the official White House petition website a petition with  signatures to make unlocking phones legal prompted a response from the Senior Adviser for Internet Innovation  Privacy R PERIOD David Edelman PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  the Library of Congress deemed it illegal for consumers to unlock their phones under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA PERIOD Before that date unlocking ones phone was completely legal if heavily restricted by phone manufacturers PERIOD

When a person chooses to unlock his or her phone it allows the phone to be used outside the network it was purchased under giving the customer the freedom to a network even one outside the country PERIOD This is different from jailbreaking ones phone which is completely legal and allows software not approved by the phones manufacturer to be installed though it often voids the phones warranty PERIOD

The statement said the Obama Administration will work with Congress to overturn Librarian of Congress James H PERIOD Billingtons decision that cell phones would no longer be exempt from the DMCA PERIOD Both the Department of Commerce and the FCC support the White House in this goal according to the statement PERIOD

The Department of Commerces National Telecommunications and Information Administration actually advised the Library of Congress against its action yet Billington continued PERIOD

Even the telecommunications corporations that stand to lose something from allowing customers to unlock their cell phones are backing the Obama Administration PERIOD

ATT is already on board with this plan PERIOD Soon after the White Houses statement was released the telecom giant announced it would begin to unlock customers phones after  days if those customers met a certain set of guidelines PERIOD

In the blog post announcing this decision the corporation stated ATTs policy is to unlock our customers devices if theyve met the terms of their service agreements and we have the unlock code. theres a large hurdle hidden in that statement ATT needs the unlock codes from the phones manufacturer in order to fulfill their end of the deal PERIOD Should a phone manufacturer withhold those codes all this effort would be for naught PERIOD

However other countries have already devised a way to leap that particular obstacle PERIOD

In Canada two days after unlocking phones in America was deemed illegal the first draft of a bill forcing wireless carriers to unlock their phones was released PERIOD

Along with requiring wireless providers to unlock all their customers phones customers would also be given tools to monitor their data usage and limit any feature that may be using up too much data PERIOD The bill would also limit early contract termination fees to just any subsidies the customer received upon signing the contract PERIOD

There are economic factors to be considered too PERIOD Should a certain network become too expensive someone on a limited budget  a student for example  might want to switch networks PERIOD However when switching to a less expensive network the student in question would likely want to keep the expensive smartphone she has PERIOD

It seems public government and even international opinion is in favor of allowing customers to use their phones with any wireless provider they wish PERIOD Having a third party limit that freedom is unreasonable limitation on that customers freedom PERIOD
