5191,2009-11-01,"junior wide receiver Scotty McKnight holds off a Missouri defensive player during Saturdays game at Folsom Field PERIOD The Buffs lost to Mizzou  PERIOD McKnight says the game was not a representation of how well the team has been performing at practices PERIOD

Colorado Buffaloes senior strong safety Ben Burney looked like a battered warrior as his bruised right shoulder was wrapped PERIOD But his shoulder doesnt hurt as much as his pride PERIOD

This is my last season Im done after this Burney said PERIOD I love you guys and Im trying to play my heart out PERIOD I dont care about my body PERIOD I dont care about anybody but this team PERIOD Its my family PERIOD We just got to come out and act that way sacrifice everything for the season. after CUs  loss Saturday to the Missouri Tigers the Buffs season is on the line PERIOD They are  which means they are one defeat away from missing a bowl game for the third time in head coach Dan Hawkins fouryear tenure PERIOD

The culprit to this seasons downfall is simple The team failed to show up when the game started  again PERIOD

For the fourth time this season all losses the Buffs trailed by doubledigits at halftime PERIOD Against Mizzou CU handed the Tigers a 33point cushion in the first half PERIOD

When you look at the scoreboard were losing by  points junior wide receiver Scotty McKnight said PERIOD Im about to blow a gasket on the sidelines. getting angry might be a solution but the reality is no one really knows why they stumble of the chute PERIOD And as Burney said time is running out PERIOD

Many on the team have their theories about why they have slow starts PERIOD

For example Hawkins said he thinks players need to gain momentum by making a couple of big plays PERIOD Meanwhile junior linebacker B.J PERIOD Beatty said maybe guys havent woken up because of the early start times of the last two games PERIOD

Both are valid reasons PERIOD After all its hard to make gamechanging plays or wake up when Mizzou sophomore quarterback Blaine Gabbert had all day to find every receiving option available PERIOD Gabbert was sacked just once and had so much time he couldve had his morning coffee and read a newspaper before deciding who to throw to PERIOD

If Mizzous  lead in the second quarter didnt wake up the sleeping Buffs then maybe some Halloween trickery will PERIOD The Tigers went trickortreating on the Buffs when holder Forrest Shock faked a 41yard field goal attempt and threw a shovel pass to Gahn McGaffie for a 24yard touchdown PERIOD

Another possible theory came from McKnight who said he felt some players were waiting for someone else to make a play instead of grabbing the situation by its horns PERIOD

As an offense you got to take pride and go out there and make plays in the first snap of the game and not wait for someone else to make something happen to kind of fuel you with energy McKnight said PERIOD You just have to take pride in that. of course the simplest theory could be the team lacks the will to want to succeed until they are in a ditch the size of the Grand Canyon PERIOD It isnt out of the question as one player alluded PERIOD

They werent doing anything different sophomore quarterback Tyler Hansen said PERIOD We werent doing anything different PERIOD I think we just came out too lackadaisical too relaxed PERIOD I think we need a little fire to us and we didnt have the fire in the first half PERIOD In the second half we kind of wanted it more. the most puzzling part about this situation is both the coaching staff and the players said they had great practices leading up to the game PERIOD But when the lights are the brightest CU seems to lack the concentration to shine PERIOD

I thought we had our best practice weve had in a long time on Tuesday Hawkins said PERIOD I think they were ready PERIOD Meetings were good the prep was good all of that I thought was really good PERIOD Its hard to tell with guys what their mentality is going to be. mcKnight added Were practicing great and thats what make this so frustrating PERIOD I dont feel like guys are losing focus but when we get into the game we need to make plays and we need to do a better job focusing in general. the only thing for certain is the Buffs have trapped themselves into a corner and they are looking for ways to escape PERIOD If the Buffs dont find an exit strategy and get off to quicker starts by  a.m PERIOD next Saturday against Texas AM then you can stick a fork in them PERIOD

We are a trapped animal and we have to get out Burney said PERIOD If we play to our full potential we can win games. contact CU Independent Sports Editor Cheng Sio at Cheng.siocolorado.edu PERIOD
