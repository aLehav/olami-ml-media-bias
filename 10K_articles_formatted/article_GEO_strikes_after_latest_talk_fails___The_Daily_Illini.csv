In a bargaining session between the University and GEO Saturday that lasted six hours both sides were able to reach an agreement on all aspects of a contract except for tuition waiver security PERIOD As a result the GEO rejected the Universitys latest proposal PERIOD

According to a press release from the University the GEO strike committee has chosen to strike over an issue that historically has never been a source of contention between the union and management and about which there is no indication would be a source of contention in the future. the Universitys latest proposal sought to increase the minimum stipend for graduate students who work  hours a week nine months out of the year and increase the student health insurance fee subsidies PERIOD The proposal also wanted to create a parental accommodation period following the birth or initial adoption of a child offer protection against changes to the Board of Trustees tuition waiver policy for graduate assistants and grant the right to bargain over any changes to that policy according to the Universitys press release PERIOD

We absolutely are agreeing to the continuation of the current tuition policy said Robin Kaler University spokeswoman PERIOD We are agreeing that if we would ever change the current tuition policy we wouldnt do that without first bargaining such changes with the Union. the GEO wants protection waivers mentioned in the contract which are not being offered by the administration said Peter Campbell communications officer for the GEO PERIOD

There was an agreement to drop proposals that would have created contract language recognizing the Universitys right to furlough graduate assistants and limit the GEOs ability to engage in impact bargaining during the term of the agreement PERIOD

What we would like is explicit protection for tuition waivers in the contract itself and that has not been offered by the administration said Campbell PERIOD

According to an email sent by Interim Provost Robert Easter Nov PERIOD  the the university has no plans to change current policy on tuition waivers PERIOD

The university community is committed to providing the most competitive tuition waivers possible. the Universitys press release reminded faculty and nonGEO staff that they are expected to perform their job duties as usual during the strike PERIOD

Students who have paid tuition have reason to expect that classes will take place as usual and it is the Universitys intention to honor that promise the press release stated PERIOD

Saturdays session was the nineteenth set of bargaining sessions between the University and the GEO PERIOD According to the press release the University made approximately two dozen separate offers throughout the bargaining process before reaching the final offer that was ultimately rejected PERIOD

If teaching and graduate assistants choose to work they will be paid as usual the release stated PERIOD However employees who elect not to work cannot be paid PERIOD

Interim Provost Robert Easter sent out an email on Nov PERIOD  to all administration members and faculty which conveyed the Universitys hopes for the strikes outcome PERIOD

We hope assistants will respect their instructional obligations and not impair students progress in their current courses PERIOD The campus will monitor the situation closely and assess options for dealing with any disruption that might occur to minimize the harm which a work stoppage would cause. the members of the GEO will take the Universitys offers to a vote again Tuesday night PERIOD
