The eyes of the world were on New York City this week as The Gates the highly anticipated creation of artists Christo and JeanneClaude which outfits Central Park in saffroncolored fabric was unveiled and met with crowds of thousands PERIOD But who needs Christo and JeanneClaude when weve got Matt Brogan Brogan a senior is the coordinator of Colgates second annual Arts Festival the weeklong celebration of music theater and the fine arts that has consumed the campus this week PERIOD Ice sculptures beautified by a rainbows spectrum of colored lights adorn the quad PERIOD Student performers are spicing up dinner at The Edge PERIOD Today alone there are two theater workshops a Colgate architecture walking tour a student exhibition and open house at Little Hall the second night of the Vagina Monologues at the Palace and a night cap of karaoke at the Creative Arts House see the campus calendar at www.colgate.edu for the complete schedule PERIOD Its difficult enough to promote one event at Colgate said Brogan PERIOD Try  We have some holes where people arent too sure whats going on PERIOD But in general everyone knows its Arts Festival and somewhere something is happening. eighteen different student organizations from the Brothers to the Anime Club leant a hand in making the Arts Festival possible PERIOD But while the students are the driving force behind the festivities the administration should certainly be commended for its backing of the Colgate Arts Initiative the umbrella group that put the weeks events together PERIOD At a school obsessed with the liberal arts a week dominated by the fine and performing arts is a welcome change PERIOD The Arts Festival has done for Colgate what The Gates has done for New York it has made art a public spectacle for all to enjoy.We should all find a way to fit an event or two or three of the Arts Festival into our weekend plans PERIOD It only comes around once a year PERIOD
