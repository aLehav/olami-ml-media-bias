Chin hopes Share Meals will help battle food insecurity and bring the NYU community together PERIOD

Alice Li Contributing WriterFeb  

Its no secret that food brings us together PERIOD After all Marilyn Monroe tested the waters with Colin Clark by asking him to dinner PERIOD Amidst the hustle and bustle of New York City the universality of shared meals acts as common ground among city dwellers PERIOD Steinhardt graduate student Jon Chin founder of Share Meals shares this sentiment PERIOD

Chin believes that sharing a meal is not only a way to combat food insecurity but is also an anesthetic for loneliness PERIOD Chin finds that NYU students are aware of the lack of community in the city and often feel stratified and lonely PERIOD

I think being able to dine with another student somebody youve never met before and have food in between you and have this jumping off point to start a conversation and to meet somebody is a great way to fight isolation and depression Chin said PERIOD

NYU was the birthplace of his techoriented solution to the food insecurity of students across college campuses PERIOD Chin who created Share Meals as a platform to end hunger was combing through anonymous posts on the NYU Secrets Facebook page when he was disheartened by one students post PERIOD

I was following NYU Secrets and saw a secret by a student who was talking about how he couldnt feed himself Chin said PERIOD He didnt have enough money to buy groceries PERIOD And I felt really sad obviously. having glossed over the situation the first time around Chin realized the severity of hunger among his classmates when these posts continued to surface PERIOD

I said to myself this is a pattern this is a crisis this is a problem PERIOD Its not just one student whos really unlucky who cant feed themselves PERIOD Its an epidemic. students expressed their commiseration with the anonymous posts PERIOD Chin was inspired by the generosity of students who responded to the posts noticing that students were enthusiastic to help PERIOD

After seeing multiple posts in a row regarding the same issue of food insecurity Chin realized the necessity of creating a more accessible way for students with meals to spare to connect with with students who are food insecure PERIOD Thus Share Meals was created PERIOD

On the website and app students are able to donate or receive free food or meal swipes PERIOD Once signing up with an .edu email you can choose between three options finding free food or swipes from other students giving food or swipes or posting about local free food events PERIOD According to Chin the majority of swipe donations happens in the last few weeks of the semester when students realize they have about  swipes leftover PERIOD

It was the merger of his English Education and Computer Science background and entrepreneurial spirit that brought Share Meals to life PERIOD With the determination to combat these matters Chin has created a medium through which college students  and expanding populations  can tackle food insecurity PERIOD

I think a lot of our social problems would benefit greatly from a combination of things Chin said PERIOD I want to bring artists and engineers together and come up with these new awesome ways to solve these problems. email Alice Li at emailprotected PERIOD
