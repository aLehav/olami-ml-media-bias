This August my Irish grandfather passed out and was rushed to the hospital PERIOD He stayed in the hospital a few days for observation as a doctor ordered a series of tests PERIOD

The results of those tests arrived by mail Wednesday Dec PERIOD  PERIOD My grandfather was diagnosed with aortic stenosis a condition where the left ventricle of the heart fails to empty properly PERIOD

Openheart surgery is a treatment option for the condition PERIOD

It took nearly four months for my grandfather to receive information of a lifethreatening disease in the form of a letter PERIOD He lives in Northern Ireland and is covered by the British socialized healthcare system PERIOD

You may believe this is an isolated case but it is a reality with which my Irish family must constantly cope PERIOD

My aunt was in a car accident last month and is now suffering from severe back pains PERIOD When she called to make a doctors appointment she was placed on a sixmonth waiting list PERIOD

There are people in the United States who would like this country to move toward a socialized healthcare system PERIOD America has the best doctors the best technology and the best patient care in the world PERIOD

Socialized medicine is meant to give all people access to these resources PERIOD However the intervention of the federal government into the medical system adds the enormous weight of its bureaucracy onto patient care PERIOD

Imagine if a single HMO handled all U.S PERIOD healthcare PERIOD No competition means there would be no impetus to improve patient care PERIOD

Waiting lists to make a doctors appointment would grow longer and medical results would be funneled through a large government bureaucracy PERIOD Socialized medicine means limited access to mediocre healthcare PERIOD

Currently in the United States the poor the elderly and the disabled do receive medical care through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid PERIOD Wouldnt it be wiser to revise and improve these programs rather than expanding them to ineffectively cover all Americans

While the idea of socialized healthcare is a worthy one it cannot be practically implemented PERIOD Whether or not to move toward socialized medicine is becoming a decision that all Americans must make PERIOD
