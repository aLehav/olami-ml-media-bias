Some say it could some say it should not whatever ones opinion both virtual and physical learning spaces have to evolve to suit the nontraditional students that Huesman spoke of PERIOD

For physical campuses the focus must be on creating spaces ideal for interaction and on the role of technology PERIOD

Based on a study done across the country students want settings in which everyone is able to collaborate and offer something to the group innovation in the classroom needs to reflect this PERIOD

Huesman noted that design needs to communicate values to learners so this feeling that everyone has something to offer could mean that having a round table with no head is ideal PERIOD It sheds the hierarchy of a classroom creating possibility of verbal exchange between everyone as well as letting people see eye to eye which many learning spaces today do not allow for PERIOD

When it comes to technology in the classroom how much is too much or how much is necessary for learners The panel all agreed that technology has a lot to offer but the important thing is that it does not replace human interaction and isolate learners PERIOD

For virtual learning spaces this is the most difficult part of innovation PERIOD Nora Bynum of Duke emphasized the importance of having active exchanges and being able to see eye to eye PERIOD

The reason campuses have always been so necessary is because students are given the spaces to actively exchange information but this is difficult without physical interaction PERIOD With the rapid growth of technology this is one of the weakest facets of the digital commons and what has to be focused on if educators want a successful new learning community PERIOD

As of now virtual learning cannot completely replace physical campuses but it has offered endless opportunity that has changed the traditional mindset about learning PERIOD

Maybe the future calls for no campuses or maybe some people will never let that happen PERIOD As long as innovators in education always keep in mind that learners need to see eye to eye a bright future could lie ahead for the physical and digital realms of education PERIOD
