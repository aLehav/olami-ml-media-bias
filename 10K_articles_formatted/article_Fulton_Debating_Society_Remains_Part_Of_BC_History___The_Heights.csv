3706,2014-02-23,"every year when spring comes to the Heights the warmer weather and hordes of prospective students are joined by a 114yearold tradition the Fulton Debate PERIOD

The Fulton Debate is a showcase event between four members of the Fulton Debating Society two on the affirmative side and two on the negative PERIOD It follows a policy debate format but with shortened constructive speeches PERIOD The whole event runs about  minutes PERIOD In recent years the topic has been related to current events said Director of Debate John Katsulas PERIOD

The debaters can win the gold Fulton Prize or the silver Gargan Medal based on their speaking ability PERIOD The winner has his name painted on the wall of Gasson  the Fulton Debate room PERIOD

However there is a disparity between the names on the wall and the official winners PERIOD In the early 1980s when Dale Herbeck coached the team he decided that if the same person won the Fulton Prize two years in a row the winner of the Gargan Medal should have his name painted on the wall PERIOD Herbeck thought it would be better to have more medals on the wall Katsulas said PERIOD

Its prestigious to be in the debate but its more prestigious to win the debate and get your name on the wall Katsulas said PERIOD Thats even more attractive than winning the gold medal. the debate generally consists of at least one debater from each divisionnovice junior varsity and varsityand is slower and less technical than a typical policy debate because the judges are often professors with no prior debate experience Katsulas said PERIOD

This is done intentionally so that the debaters are forced to speak persuasively PERIOD In this regard novices often have a legup because they can be more skilled at judge adaptation and are less used to the rapidfire style of policy debates he said PERIOD

They try to throw in some jokes and theyre more animated since theyre trying to appeal to the judges and the students he said PERIOD The debate is a lot more entertaining to watch than a regular debate just because theres more pathos and humor in the debate. the Fulton Debating Society debates against other schools through three debate organizationsthe American Debate Association the Crossfire Association and the National Debate Tournament Committeeall of which debate the same topic PERIOD The Societysmost difficult competitors in the Northeast are Harvard Dartmouth and Cornell Katsulas said PERIOD

Sullivan McCormick AS  won the Fulton Prize in  PERIOD He joined the team as a freshman after doing policy debate in high school because of Katsulas dedication to the Society and to the development of policy debate he said PERIOD When I won the award I was extremely humbled to be a part of BC debate history and at the same time felt validated for the amount of time spent focusing on debate he said PERIOD

A large part of the humility stemmed from having the opportunity to debate under the leadership of John Katsulas PERIOD I debated for Boston College because of Mr PERIOD Katsulas and its impossible not to be inspired by his passion for the activity. mcCormicks favorite part of debate is the unlimited potential for selfimprovement PERIOD There is always room to improve in research strategy and rhetoric McCormick said PERIOD The Fulton Award gives student debaters something to strive for PERIOD The wall in Gasson  is an example of the tradition of BC debate he said PERIOD

The award is one that sets BC debate apart from other collegiate programs McCormick said PERIOD No other program has the legacy and tradition attached to a debate program. in the  years since the first Fulton Debate only five women have won the award PERIOD This is partially because there are far fewer women on the debate teamthere are  members of the Fulton Society this year and only three are women PERIOD

Theres a much higher rate of attrition among women in college debate than men PERIOD There are many theories for this trend Some people say the style is too combative Katsulas said PERIOD

The first woman to win the Fulton Prize was Jane Osborne McKnight in  when she was a sophomore PERIOD She thought preparation was key to her win in addition to the fact that being a woman was a novelty she said PERIOD

It is a very intense activity and not traditionally feminine McKnight said PERIOD I was very proud to win. the best way to attract female college debaters is to recruit them in junior high and high school said McKnight who debated in high school for four years before coming to BC PERIOD Her experience on the debate team propelled her to masters program at Harvard and an over 30year legal career she said PERIOD

I am fond of saying that nearly everything I learned in higher education I learned in debate McKnight said PERIOD
