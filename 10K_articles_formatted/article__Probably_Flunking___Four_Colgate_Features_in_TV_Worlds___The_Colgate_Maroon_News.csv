Since childhood Generation Z has been accustomed to seeing the same group of American universities be central to any storyline about college PERIOD From Hannah Montanas series finale reunion with Lily at Stanford to Good Luck Charlies Teddy interviewing with Yale and the pile of extremelyselective acceptances earned by characters in Netflix programs like The Kissing Booth To All The Boys Ive Loved Before and Riverdale it feels as if only a singledigit number of colleges exist in the fictional realm PERIOD Therefore members of the Colgate University community who tuned into Netflixs newly released drama Partner Track were in for a surprise when the University was mentioned in the shows pilot episode PERIOD What follows is a summary of this and three other Colgate appearances on the small screen



Material Adverse Change  Partner Track  S1 E1 

Within its first five minutes Partner Track establishes a strong female lead Rachel Friedman Alexandra Turshen as an attorney who will not tolerate disrespect in the workplace PERIOD Get your feet off the goddamn desk PERIOD She graduated number two in her class at Harvard Law while your ass was probably flunking Colgate PERIOD Show some freakin respect Rachel says reminding an underperforming paralegal that unlike the attorneys he does not hold a graduate degree PERIOD Why Colgate was singled out among other undergraduate institutions for this diss remains a mystery PERIOD Given that many employers routinely look to hire Colgate graduates well assume that whatever personal experience this writer must have had was out of the ordinary PERIOD



Atlantic City  Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens  S1 E2 

In this episode Nora Awkwafina finds fleeting success winning a huge number of blackjack chips during a trip to Atlantic City before being disqualified by the casino for counting cards PERIOD In one scene from Noras highlight reel she gives some of her loot to a pair of prospective Colgate parents at her table PERIOD That is Sadies first semester at Colgate PERIOD And that is your first semester on an Alaskan cruise ship of your choice because I want you to love you PERIOD And tell Sadie she better stay off Twitter Nora says PERIOD With a Colgate firstyears billable expenses for Fall  carrying a price tag of  this serves as a testament to the large scope of Noras winnings before she leaves the match completely emptyhanded PERIOD



Clean Cut  The Rookie  S2 E8 

Here police officers on duty Grey Richard T PERIOD Jones and Harper Mekia Cox discuss Greys daughters admission to Cornell University which Grey believes is too far from the shows setting of Los Angeles PERIOD Overhearing this Stephanie Chloe Bridges whom the pair has just arrested for drunk driving chimes into the conversation PERIOD I went to Cornell PERIOD Or was it Colgate asks Stephanie PERIOD Though the two institutions are both private located in upstate New York highly selective and NCAA Division  they are undeniably distinguishable conveying that the accused Stephanie is certainly not in a proper state of mind PERIOD



The Tiffany Experience  S.W.A.T PERIOD  S2 E8 

This is perhaps the most explainable reference to Colgate given that S.W.A.T PERIOD was created by Shawn Ryan P22 PERIOD It sees Dr PERIOD Wendy Hughes Cathy Cahlin Ryan reflecting on her twin daughters recent move to colleges far from the series setting in Los Angeles PERIOD Middlebury and Colgate PERIOD So far away PERIOD I really miss them Wendy says PERIOD Also an homage to Shawn Ryans alma mater Middlebury College the line is a nod to all Colgate parents who may be a plane ride or several away from Hamilton PERIOD
