To the Editors

As students faculty staff and alumni of Oberlin College we are writing to voice our support and solidarity with the striking students at the University of Puerto Rico and to express our grave concern with the proposed financial cuts to the UPR the islands only public university system as well as the economic austerity measures imposed by the U.S.appointed Fiscal Oversight and Management Board created by the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act PERIOD

The cuts to the UPR which could be up to  million out of the universitys  million in public funds a  percent cut are part of a larger trend of austerity measures imposed by the FOMB that include a . minimum wage for people under  pension cuts for retired public employees cuts to funding for Medicare and Medicaid for the islands aging population and the closure of over one third of public schools in Puerto Rico since  PERIOD These austerity measures work under the guise of addressing Puerto Ricos debt crisis but in fact prioritize only the interests of financial institutions that made a business out of predatory lending on the island PERIOD This practice is so widespread on the island that almost half of the debt owed by Puerto Rico is actually interest not actual money that Puerto Rico borrowed PERIOD

UPR students have begun an indefinite strike in protest of the proposed budget cuts to the university as well as increasing tuition and other financial changes proposed by the FOMB PERIOD On April  the UPR campus at Ro Piedras received a letter from the U.S PERIOD Department of Education stating that due to the strikes the university lost eligibility for Title IV federal financial aid which includes Pell grants federal student loans and workstudy programs PERIOD In addition to the effects this has on current students incoming students will not be able to submit a FAFSA to the university PERIOD Especially given that the Department of Educations letter is directed to the students of the Ro Piedras campus it is clear that these actions are strategically targeting an institution that has long been a focal point for and home to leftwing and anticolonial thought and activism PERIOD

While there are certainly budget cuts that need to be made we are deeply concerned about who and what institutions these cuts are targeting PERIOD These cuts and the burden necessary to get Puerto Rico out of this crisis are being placed on workingclass and poor Puerto Ricans rather than the banks and corporations that created and exacerbated this debt in the first place PERIOD

Although the scale and context of the cuts to UPR are clearly very different from the cuts facing Oberlin College we feel it is important to note the similarity present The budget cuts in both places primarily affect students faculty and staff who have had little say in what money has been used for and what is being defunded PERIOD Outside interests are being prioritized at the significant expense of actual spending on education PERIOD A significant example at Oberlin is the newly renovated and rebuilt Hotel at Oberlin a financial investment that was not made for us but becomes our financial responsibility through rising tuition room and board costs and budget cuts across the board PERIOD

We would like to align ourselves with the demands presented by the student movement at the University of Puerto Rico and the more than  Puerto Ricans who have petitioned to reactivate the independent Debt Audit Commission
