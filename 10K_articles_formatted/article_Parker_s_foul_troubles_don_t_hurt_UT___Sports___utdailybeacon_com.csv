WEST LAFAYETTE Ind PERIOD  From the beginning it just wasnt in the cards for Oral Roberts PERIOD The 16thseeded Golden Eagles couldnt overcome the Lady Vols defense even with forward Candace Parker out of the game for most of the second half as Tennessee won  in the first round of the NCAA tournament PERIOD

What made it worse was the loss of ORUs starting point guard and secondleading scorer Mariana Camargo who slipped on a cheerleaders sign while diving for a loose ball in the opening minutes of the game PERIOD

The Oral Roberts junior will likely have surgery on her left leg PERIOD

Im proud of the girls because we had to really wing it said Oral Roberts coach Jerry Finkbeiner PERIOD Jenny Hardin our post player played threeguard for us and another guard came in and played post for us PERIOD Everything we ran for  minutes and  seconds was just more improvised. the Lady Vols held ORU scoreless for  minutes  seconds during the first half and nearly  minutes during the second PERIOD The Golden Eagles committed  turnovers that turned into  points for Tennessee PERIOD UT never trailed in the game PERIOD

UT overcame their own sloppy play after not playing in two weeks after the SEC tournament PERIOD Coach Pat Summitts squad turned the ball over  times including  in the first half PERIOD

I could sit here and make excuses about the twoweek break but they had the same twoweek break that we had Parker said PERIOD I think we did a better job in the second half focusing PERIOD We need to take responsibility for our turnovers and oneonone defense. the duo of Parker and guard Alexis Hornbuckle combined for  of UTs  points in the first half PERIOD Hornbuckle started the game 3of3 from the 3point line and finished the game with  points seven assists and six rebounds PERIOD Parker finished with  points and four steals but was limited to only  minutes of play because of foul problems PERIOD She received her fourth foul with  remaining in the second half and didnt return PERIOD

The Lady Vols pulled away from ORU outscoring them  in the second half PERIOD All nine players that dressed for UT scored PERIOD Every starter finished in doubledigit points except guard Shannon Bobbitt PERIOD Freshman Angie Bjorklund came off the bench and led the team with  points connecting on 4of10 from the 3point line PERIOD

Oral Roberts  was unable to advance to the second round in its fifth NCAA tournament appearance PERIOD

The Lady Vols now take on ninthseed Purdue on the Boilermakers home court in the second round Tuesday at  p.m PERIOD Purdue defeated eightseed Utah  behind 17point games from Kalika France and FahKara Malone PERIOD

We are going to take this one and move forward and play here at Purdue against Purdue Summitt said PERIOD It is going to be a big challenge for us. log In
