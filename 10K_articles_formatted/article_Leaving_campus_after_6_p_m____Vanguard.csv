Ever feel as if it takes much longer to get home in the evening than it did to get to school in the morning After a lateending class or meeting on campus all most people want is to get home as soon as possible but for many students leaving campus at night means a seemingly endless wait for the bus or a long walk in the dark PERIOD

Some evening classes end as late at  p.m. and the later it gets the tougher it gets to escape campus especially if you dont own a car PERIOD Here are some tips on how to escape PSU after  p.m PERIOD

By bus Most buses that run on Southwest Fifth and Sixth avenues begin running less frequently around  p.m PERIOD By  p.m PERIOD most routes start running only every half hour leaving from the Pioneer Square area at two and  minutes past the hour PERIOD

If you are planning to catch the bus by PSU late at night make sure to be at Sixth Avenue stops by  minutes after the hour and Fifth Avenue stops by  minutes after the hour to ensure that youre not left waiting for what can seem like an eternity when it is dark or rainy PERIOD

Of course it is always a good idea to have a copy of your routes schedule and check its specific times PERIOD You can pick up a paper copy of many route schedules in Neuberger Hall Smith Memorial Student Union or at the Portland State Bookstore or check online at www.trimet.org PERIOD

By MAX or streetcar The MAX runs frequently until  p.m PERIOD weekday nights from Pioneer Square PERIOD You may find a walk through the Park Blocks to the square is faster and more relaxing than the sometimes painfully slow streetcar ride PERIOD If encountering the variety of people that can congregate in the Park Blocks after dark makes you uncomfortable you can always walk down Broadway or Sixth Avenue instead which have much brighter lighting PERIOD

If headed to the Pearl District the streetcar is definitely the way to go and it runs more or less every  minutes until midnight on weekdays PERIOD

By bike You are missing out on part of the authentic Portland experience if you have never ridden home by bike in the pouring rain PERIOD

After the initial cost bike riding is much cheaper than gas or bus fare and may be your quickest way home at night if you live in the Goose Hollow Northwest or BelmontHawthorne areas PERIOD Just make sure to get a set of bright LED lights  at most bike shops so that cars can see you when you ride at night as well as a set of rain fenders PERIOD

By foot Slow down relax PERIOD Portland is a beautiful city at night PERIOD If you are headed to the east side take a stroll across the Hawthorne Bridge and take in a great view of the downtown area PERIOD

Even the Park Blocks can be nice at night but as mentioned earlier sticking to well lit areas is always the safest bet when walking at night especially if you are alone PERIOD

Also its not a bad idea to have an umbrella handy PERIOD
