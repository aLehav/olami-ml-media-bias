In response to the many letters about the riots and how disgraceful it was the riots really were not that bad PERIOD People need to put this into perspective PERIOD No one was injured and no buildings were severely damaged PERIOD Sure some light posts were torn down but people are acting like this never happens at universities PERIOD

Do some research on what happened after Boston won the World Series in  PERIOD A student died in Emerson College and riots very similar to ours broke out all around New England PERIOD In  students at the University of Maryland broke out in a riot that involved a half dozen fires after their womens basketball team won the National Championship PERIOD Maryland also had a riot after their team lost to Duke in the Final Four in  and caused  dollars worth of damage PERIOD

Do we look at the Maryland or Emerson as being crazy riot schools Dont even begin to compare us to West Virginia PERIOD When West Virginia beat Virginia Tech in  there were approximately   fires set PERIOD We may have gone a bit too far but dont be ignorant and think this was one of the worst riots in college history when its not even the worst in recent college history PERIOD
