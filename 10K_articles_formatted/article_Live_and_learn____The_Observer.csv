Katie Kohler  Thursday August  

You learn a lot when you get to senior year PERIOD I have learned that eating Penn Station three times a week is wrong PERIOD That you have to study to get good grades PERIOD That when you leave your license on the floor at Corbys sometimes you wont get it back PERIOD That senioritis is in fact a real and contagious disease PERIOD But more than anything I learned that four years is a very very short time PERIOD

Living with people eating with people learning with people forces you to make fast friends which is why and how I am friends with the people I am now PERIOD My friends and I were talking the other day about our freshman year roommates and how we became friends even though we didnt live together PERIOD We became friends because we went to the bathroom at the same time or went to Vendoland at three in the morning PERIOD Its the little things that brought us all together PERIOD

If I had any advice to give to a freshman Id say a few things PERIOD A Go to class PERIOD B Appreciate the dining hall food because once you live off campus you have to fend for yourself PERIOD C Be spontaneous PERIOD Just do things that make you happy because like I said earlier four years is a very very very short time PERIOD

When I think about my four years its basically impossible to do without thinking about The Observer PERIOD During FroshO I walked into the basement of South Dining Hall and listened to some very intimidating people talk about the paper PERIOD I picked up my first story about the opening school Mass and butchered it PERIOD Surprisingly I decided to keep writing and with the help of some wonderful seniors I got the swing of things PERIOD Then I started work in the office PERIOD Then I became Assistant News Editor PERIOD Then I was the Saint Marys Editor PERIOD Then I was the Assistant Managing Editor PERIOD Then I was working in the office three days a week at all hours of the day PERIOD Thinking back sometimes I wonder why I sacrificed so much time for The O PERIOD But then I think about all the doors it opened up for me PERIOD

I met some great people learned a lot and became a part of something really great PERIOD Even though some people bash The Observer or dont read it so many other people rely on it for campus news or at least a good Viewpoint war PERIOD We worked so hard everyday and I am proud that I was a part of it  I also met some pretty cool people in the process PERIOD

So basically I loved college very much and I am so happy that I decided to come to Saint Marys PERIOD Even though the job market isnt too promising I wish everyone the best and hope I run into people in the most random places PERIOD Happy graduation and while not many people will get this reference hey Pothees and goodbye BroooOOOOoothers PERIOD

Katie Kohler is a senior political science major PERIOD After graduation she is working for Arlen Specter yes Arlen Specter in D.C PERIOD for the summer PERIOD After that she is on Gods good humor PERIOD Katie enjoys Degrassi EZMac her Snuggie Titanic and long walks on the beach PERIOD She does not enjoy jellyfish or golf PERIOD She wants to thank everyone who paid for her education cough Marmie and JeffZ and wants to say haaaaaay to her sisters Meemerz Tare and Rat PERIOD Peace out homes PERIOD
