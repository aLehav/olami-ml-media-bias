1843,2023-11-04,"to anyone going to the Team Gallery building on Wooster Street in SoHo the view from inside will reveal a front lawn a bedroom a bathroom and a living room all colored white with the word Nemesims written on the mailbox PERIOD This unusual setup is the latest creation from Markus Muntean and Adi Rosenblum a pair of Austriabased artists who have recreated a house from the popular video game The Sims. the Sims a video game series created by Will Wright focuses on following a group of people called Sims and ensures they are as happy as possible PERIOD Often increasing their happiness levels involves buying consumer goods such as furniture and artwork PERIOD

For Muntean and Rosenblum The Sims creates a culture in which worldly objects are required to make people happy PERIOD The artists believe the game is impossible to win and players can only keep their Sims happy by accumulating wealth PERIOD

The Sims can be thought of as a virtual training ground for contemporary consumer culture making explicit capitalist conceptions of happiness said Emma Fernberger an assistant curator at Team Gallery PERIOD

If players choose they can starve or emotionally deprive their Sims as the godlike status of the player allows for numerous possibilities PERIOD The Nemesims plays with its viewers by placing them inside a house as if they are Sims themselves PERIOD

The viewer moves through the artificial living space as the avatar experiencing the constructed environment from within thusly becoming the malleable consumer rather than the godlike controlling hand Fernberger said PERIOD

The focus of the exhibit is on the pieces of art decorating the walls rather than the house itself PERIOD These paintings by artists including Alexander Calder William Eggleston Gilbert  George Keith Haring and many others convey the main theme the exhibit seeks to portray consumerism in modern culture PERIOD The artwork satirizes and berates the fascination with worldly objects that are necessary to the Sims happiness and the happiness of people in modern society PERIOD

Some disagree with the idea that The Sims has an unintentional capitalist agenda PERIOD Buying things for the characters is only one of the numerous ways to make them happy while many of the newer versions of the game also focus on building relationships between the characters PERIOD

The point of The Sims isnt consumerism its escapism said Tisch freshman Valeria Rotella PERIOD Its creating your own ideal world and getting away from real problems PERIOD A lot of people like The Sims for its emotional parts as opposed to just building big houses. regardless of these competing ideas Nemesims is an interesting experience for anyone curious about consumerism or modern art PERIOD

Nemesims will be on display through Dec PERIOD  at the Team Gallery at  Wooster PERIOD
