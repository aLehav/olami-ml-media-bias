Observer Staff Report  Monday April  

Whether one was raised as a lifelong Notre Dame fan by alumni discovered one of the tricampus schools later in life or was recruited as an athlete each persons journey to college is unique PERIOD The college admissions scandal which came to light in March sparked a larger conversation about this process by highlighting inequalities in the system PERIOD

Following this revelation The Observer decided to take an indepth look at college acceptances in the tricampus community and spotlight students admissions stories PERIOD Over the course of about one month our writers reported and wrote on this topic interviewing admissions athletics administrators and of course the students themselves PERIOD This Insider features members of the Notre Dame Saint Marys and Holy Cross community who come from a variety of distinct experiences  including legacy athlete lowincome firstgeneration and undocumented backgrounds PERIOD

In order to reach out to the latter three groups The Observer created a form for students to share their stories PERIOD In a matter of six days we received  responses from members of the tricampus community PERIOD Of the respondents . identified as lowincome students . identified as firstgeneration students and . identified as DACA recipients or undocumented students PERIOD From these responses reporters selected a handful of students from each campus to interview PERIOD

Through this Insider we hope to further examine the college admissions process in the tricampus community PERIOD If you want to join the conversation feel free to submit a letter to the editor PERIOD If you have a related story idea you can submit it on our website PERIOD We always want to hear your story PERIOD
