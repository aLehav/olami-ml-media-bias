Wednesday Sept PERIOD   In a move not seen in contemporary Russian history since World War I and World War II Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilization of the Russian population to bolster the countrys struggling war effort in Ukraine PERIOD An estimated  additional soldiers between the ages of  and  are being targeted in this draft PERIOD Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claims the draft will not be among the general population but those who had formerly served in the Russian armed forces PERIOD Military conscription is compulsory for Russian males ages  to  PERIOD Soldiers currently under contract have also had the duration of their deployment extended indefinitely showcasing the extent of Moscows desperation in the face of increased Ukrainian momentum PERIOD These developments come on the heels of a massively successful Ukrainian counteroffensive targeting the Kherson and Kharkiv regions reclaiming up to  square miles of territory including the entirety of the Kharkiv oblast in northeastern Ukraine PERIOD

With an estimated  Russian soldiers either killed wounded or captured during the now seven months of fighting Putin finds himself in the unenviable position of either continuing the slaughter of Ukrainians and Russians alike or losing his autocratic grip on the Russian Federation PERIOD The domestic impact of mobilization is already beginning to dissolve the bonds of social cohesion in Russia with protestors taking to the streets of Moscow and St PERIOD Petersburg and federal troops being deployed to the Russian Republic of Dagestan to help quell mounting discontent and increasingly violent resistance to the Kremlinenforced mobilization PERIOD Tasked with reinforcing a 600milelong frontline these unwitting participants find themselves in the midst of an army in organizational disarray with adequate supplies and weaponry running low among already existing units PERIOD Russian supply lines already find themselves stretched beyond their capacity in addition to being routinely targeted by Ukrainianoperated and U.Ssupplied HIMARS missile strikes which themselves played a large role in the Ukrainian capacity to attack mediumrange Russian supply depots and positions PERIOD

Wednesdays address marked a number of integral developments for the war thus far with President Putin announcing four distinct and controversial referendums to be held within the occupied territories of Donetsk Luhansk Kherson and Zaporizhzhya PERIOD The topic at hand whether or not these internationally recognized regions or oblasts of Ukraine will join the Russian Federation PERIOD Allegations of Russian tampering have run rampant throughout the international community with the New York Times reporting on videos of armed soldiers going house to house and building to building coercing votes out of those residing in these occupied territories PERIOD The United States and its western coalition of allies are rightfully unlikely to recognize the results of the votes with U.S PERIOD Secretary of State Anthony Blinken among others preemptively decrying the votes as sham referenda. unfortunately for the plight of peace the strongly worded condemnations of western leaders have done little to stop Russias illegal war of aggression PERIOD

Putins initiative to consolidate stolen Ukrainian territory comes as his hands are increasingly tied in terms of methods of response PERIOD Russias status as a selfimposed pariah state has isolated it from the cooperative global order transforming the armed struggle in Ukraine from one of imperial ambition to one of existential crisis in the eyes of Vladimir Putin and Russian leadership PERIOD To this end Putin capitalized on the existential fear of human civilization by invoking the threat of nuclear weapons as his rhetorical trump card PERIOD After first falsely claiming that western officials had floated the idea of using nuclear weapons against Russia Putin went on to state In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us PERIOD This is not a bluff. whether this rhetoric is genuine or not it is unlikely his nuclear saberrattling will be enough to force Ukraine into capitulation and NATO into apathy PERIOD

While Ukraine and its allies rejoice in the liberation of previously occupied territories the realities of Russian occupation render these brief moments of cathartic celebration shortlived PERIOD On Saturday Sept PERIOD  the excavation of mass graves was completed in the recently liberated city of Izium Kharkiv Oblast revealing the bodies of  people  showing signs of torture PERIOD Izium exists not as an aberration of the Russian invasion but as a pattern of behavior for the invading forces PERIOD As Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv Oblast in March of this year  lives were extinguished in the suburb of Bucha not because of their strategic importance but for existing where and when they did PERIOD Russias scorched earth campaign of eliminating all things Ukrainian razed the coastal city of Mariupol to the ground destroying  percent of all buildings and killing at least  in its indiscriminate artillery attacks PERIOD The true human cost of Russias hellish campaign wont be known until years after the last bullet is fired but for the innumerable innocents whose lives have been uprooted and destroyed the war will never truly end PERIOD

Juul Laboratories recently settled upon a multistate agreement with  U.S PERIOD states and Puerto Rico regarding their marketing practices targeting minors PERIOD Per Connecticut Attorney General William Tong the lead state representative spearheading the issue They relentlessly marketed vaping products to underage youth. the implications of the agreement are tantamount to utter financial decimation for the vaping giant having been barred from depicting people under  in its marketing product placements in film and television advertising on billboards and social media selling Juulbranded merchandise and funding education programs in schools PERIOD Juul has tried to deny any potential wrongdoing in their marketing practices claiming that they had voluntarily ceased all practices now banned under the new ruling which stems from an initial investigation started in  PERIOD

This settlement comes on the heels of a particularly lackluster series of litigious decisions against Juul who has already paid out a total of  million to four different states including Louisiana Washington Arizona and North Carolina since the start of  PERIOD Even more devastating for Juul was the FDAs June ruling earlier this year ordering the company to cease all sales within the United States on account of the companys disproportionate role in the rise in youth vaping PERIOD While their products are still being sold in stores today due to an appeal being filed against the FDA Juuls fall from grace has been nothing short of poetic PERIOD Juuls  valuation as a  billion dollar company now appears to be nothing more than vapor in the air as the companys apocalyptic public relations nightmare has now caused the companys value to drop all the way to . billion dollars today PERIOD In a case of friendly fire in the nicotine market Marlboro manufacturer Altria Inc PERIOD has slashed its investment into Juul by a whopping  percent dropping from . billion all the way down to  million PERIOD More concerningly for Juul however their now reduced valuation allows Altria to contractually exit their preexisting noncompete clause opening the door for them to usher in a new equally harmful and more monetizable brand of vaporizers free from the headaches they bought into with Juul PERIOD

Electronic cigarette usage has emerged as a pressing public health issue for the worlds younger demographic introducing a generation primed to loathe the sight of combustible tobacco to the wonders of a candyflavored head rush PERIOD While the efficacy of these products as cessation devices for those quitting regular cigarettes is certainly worth hearing out companies such as Juul cannot look the public in the face and claim that this is what drove their meteoric rise to public infamy PERIOD Their path to a  billion dollar empire was built on the coughing and convulsing bodies of their adolescent victims both informed and uninformed alike PERIOD However as convenient as it would be to believe that regulatory measures toppling Juuls vaping monopoly will lead to a significant reduction in the harm caused to those who partake the damage is already done PERIOD According to the New England Journal of Medicine there was a  percent increase in adolescents using ecigarettes between  and  alone with approximately . million teenagers who now must bear the burden of addiction that public health workers in this country had fought so diligently to eliminate PERIOD

Ultimately nature abhors a vacuum and even if Juuls house of cards comes crashing down upon itself the market will adapt and those who bought into the nicotine lifestyle will just transition to the next best thing PERIOD Unfortunately Pandoras Box of nicotine has already been opened and whether Juul goes down or not the victims of the corporations marketing practices will bear a burden equal in severity to the . billion Juul must pay to finance its mistakes PERIOD
