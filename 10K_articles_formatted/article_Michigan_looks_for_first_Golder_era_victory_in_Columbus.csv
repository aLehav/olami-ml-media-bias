Since Kurt Golder became the Michigan mens gymnastics teams head coach in  hes led his team to one national title and two Big Ten titles PERIOD

But hes never tasted victory in Columbus PERIOD

And frankly he doesnt expect things to change this year PERIOD

I think were a better team but from what Ive learned from history its not possible for Michigan to win at Ohio State Golder said PERIOD If we can pull that off I would be very happy. not long ago the sixthranked Buckeyes were easy to overlook  in the early part of the season they didnt even have enough meets to be counted in the GymInfo rankings PERIOD Without standouts Jake Bateman and Tai Lee they scored a paltry . in a loss at California on March  PERIOD

But last weekend Ohio State  Big Ten  overall hung tough with No PERIOD  Oklahoma losing by just four points PERIOD And any team that can do that needs to be taken seriously PERIOD

Maybe some of the guys were thinking the Buckeyes are a little bit down this year Golder said PERIOD Well not if theyre scoring within four points of Oklahoma PERIOD I dont know if we can do that. golder said he hopes last Saturdays Senior Night loss to Illinois removes the chance of the Wolverines coasting to the finish PERIOD

No PERIOD  Michigan   beat No PERIOD  Illinois both times the teams met in invitationals and Golder was concerned a third straight victory would cause his team to let up PERIOD

Had we beat them the third time it would be very easy  no matter what the coaching staff were to say  for them to maybe just get on easy street and just coast a little bit Golder said PERIOD

Golder shuffled the team for Saturdays meet especially on pommel horse where Michigan struggled to score well last weekend PERIOD

Junior Mel Santander and redshirt freshmen Devan Cote and Adam Hamers have been slotted into the pommel horse lineup with Cote also taking spots on the parallel bars and high bar PERIOD Santander joins star sophomores Chris Cameron and Thomas Kelley in the allaround competition for the first time in team competition since Jan PERIOD  against Iowa PERIOD

The Wolverines will need all the momentum they can get PERIOD In their final regularseason meet of the year they will compete in one of the Big Tens toughest atmospheres  Saturday marks the Buckeyes Senior Night when the crowd will be full of the gymnasts family and friends PERIOD

Nobody hates Michigan like Ohio State so theyll be loud Golder said PERIOD Thats what were in the sport for to have those kinds of situations where you have to overcome that adversity PERIOD Just like competing in a championship setting theres a lot of energy a lot of distractions and you have to overcome it. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
