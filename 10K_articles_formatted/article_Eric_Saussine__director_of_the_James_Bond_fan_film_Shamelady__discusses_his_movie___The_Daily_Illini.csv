Wikinews Why did you make this film Where did the inspiration for Shamelady come from

Eric Saussine In  Ian Fleming created James Bond and therefore the myth we all know PERIOD In  for the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of Ian Flemings hero I thought that it was time to pay tribute to this literary and cinema myth  PERIOD In September  I called his friend Pierre Rodiac a former president a French James Bond fan club PERIOD I talked to him about my idea to adapt Casino Royale the only Ian Fleming James Bond novel that was not seriously adapted by Eon holder of the movie rights PERIOD Pierre was excited by the project and he started writing a synopsis PERIOD We worked alternatively on it PERIOD It gave way to a script which I wrote and Pierre corrected that was a faithful adaptation of the novel with all the trademarks of the movie franchise PERIOD Then I immediately started the search for actors and locations PERIOD

On February   Eon Productions announced that Martin Campbell would direct the twenty-first film of the series PERIOD The title was Casino Royale

I was happy because I had always wanted to see that PERIOD I went back to work on my project PERIOD I decided to preserve the general plot change the names of the villains the bad guys plan a few scenes and reintroduced a well known terrorist organization and its chief from the Bond films and novels  S.P.E.C.T.R.E PERIOD and Ernst Stavro Blofeld PERIOD I wrote a new script in a couple of months and found its title  Shamelady PERIOD Preproduction started in  PERIOD Filming started in  and went on in  PERIOD Postproduction took place in  and the release date was December   PERIOD

Wikinews Last summer you announced that Constellation Studios is at work on another Bond film Shatterhand PERIOD Tell us about it PERIOD

Eric Saussine Well the team was so happy to do Shamelady PERIOD At the end of this movie we were tired but response from the team members themselves that the first of them Serge Rotelli Bond asked that we do another one PERIOD Of course I had many ideas going wild in many directions in my mind PERIOD So following that wave of enthusiasm I decided to renew the experience and launched the production of a new James Bond  adventure PERIOD This time the film will be our way to celebrate Ian Flemings hundredth birthday PERIOD

The plot will stay close to Flemings literary works and will be derived from the short story Octopussy the last third of the novel You Only Live Twice hence the title Shatterhand which is Blofelds pseudonym in that adventure PERIOD The new film also includes an original ski chase in the precredit sequence and an explosive action finale PERIOD Some shots were done for real in Japan PERIOD We will probably miss the Fleming centenary in  and will probably release it one year later PERIOD

Wikinews Is this the beginning of a series of nonprofit fan films After Shatterhand can we expect to see more Bond films from you

Eric Saussine It was never seen as a series but when we released Shamelady Shatterhands production was already halfway and the people at the premiere kept saying to me that they wanted to participate and that I should do a trilogy PERIOD Nothings worth a trilogy PERIOD So given the extraordinary willingness of some people we are thinking about one final chapter PERIOD Of course my everboiling mind has some idea ready PERIOD I can tell you that part of a final chapter could take place in Switzerland and that we might see Piz Gloria again for a few seconds PERIOD Other than that I am still in the middle of Shatterhand so all this stuff about a third movie is just wishful thinking PERIOD

Wikinews Wikinews waves Right.png Do you have any advice for amateur filmmakers reading this

Eric Saussine Never ever abandon your project PERIOD Too many projects fail or disappear because people dont have the will to go til the end of their ideas and realize that it is much more complicated than they thought it would be and then they drop it PERIOD It is a pity PERIOD Another advice  steal from the best i.e PERIOD the Bond movies for Bond productions Spielberg Kubrick and all the others for all movies PERIOD Mozart stole from Haydn and transcended him PERIOD Why not YOU","Eric Saussine, director of the James Bond fan film Shamelady, discusses his movie - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
