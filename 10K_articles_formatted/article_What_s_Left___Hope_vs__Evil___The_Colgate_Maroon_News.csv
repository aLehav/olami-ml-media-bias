Last week in a move that shocked Democrats and Republicans alike Karl Rove suggested to FOX News that McCain had gone one step too far in some of his recent advertisements attacking Senator Obama PERIOD When I first came across the news story on CNN.com last Sunday I was dumbfounded PERIOD

Karl Rove is an icon of dirty Republican politics and is famous for designing the strategy that put Bush into office not once but twice PERIOD During the  Republican Primary in South Carolina the Bush camp felt threatened by then candidate Senator John McCain PERIOD In the subsequent days a pushpoll was developed which asked South Carolina voters the following question Would you be less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child

Pushpolls are a common but unethical technique that campaigns employ to inform voters of important and controversial information in passive manners PERIOD While no hard evidence exists tying Rove the director of the Bush campaign directly to the pushpoll it would be hard to believe that something which blatantly altered the results of the primary came from any other source PERIOD

In the eight years following the South Carolina primary Mr PERIOD Rove managed to find himself under siege time and again for involvement in a number of different scandals PERIOD With a history of unethical behavior and the implementation of shady political action shouldnt we find it a bit disconcerting that he is attacking the methods John McCain is using to breakdown Senator Obama

Senator Obama from the start has run a campaign that is based on hope PERIOD Senator McCain however has been forced to work on the offensive and build his campaign on the basis of securing fear in the American people PERIOD The McCain camp has worked on the assumption that once they have instilled fear in the voting populous they are entitled to abuse this fear and exploit John McCains experience as the only possible remedy PERIOD On August   the McCain campaign released a television advertisement that depicted a dark and evil image of Iran suggesting their capability to build nuclear weapons and destroy Israel PERIOD The commercial closes with the following statement terrorism destroying Israel those arent serious threats Obama dangerously unprepared to be president. and yet if we think back to June of  Mr PERIOD Obama gave his first speech ever as the recognized Democratic nominee at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee meeting in Washington D.C PERIOD It is during this speech that Obama explicitly outlines his proIsrael and antiIran stance PERIOD

On September   Senator Joe Biden in a speech to voters in Columbia Missouri suggested that Republicans who advocate for people with disabilities should also be advocating for stemcell research PERIOD Although Mr PERIOD Biden never mentioned Governor Palins name directly the McCain camp was quick to assert that Mr PERIOD Biden was personally attacking Palin because her son has Down Syndrome PERIOD As the day progressed the McCainPalin people insisted that Bidens comments sunk to a new low. of course Palin knew that her son had Down syndrome even before she delivered him because of the amniocentesis she had performed a few months into her pregnancy PERIOD Antichoice political factions like Sarah Palin are often vehemently opposed to amniocentesis procedures because they are invasive can induce health problems with the unborn child and can even lead to unintentional abortions PERIOD Of course Governor Palin had the choice to have this procedure because of the tenets of Roe v PERIOD Wade a Supreme Court decision that she opposes PERIOD

The question still remains why does any of this really matter Perhaps Palins record on some of these issues might shed a bit of light PERIOD While Palin opposes a womans right to choose in the past year she and her daughter have both exercised this right of choice PERIOD Is it necessary important or even fair to talk about the morality of her daughters pregnancy Certainly not PERIOD However I would contend that it is more than fair to discuss the gaping hole that exist between what Governor Palin believes is right for the American people and what is right for her family PERIOD Without rallying around fear anywhere they can produce it the McCain camp will continue to struggle to make progress in the polls PERIOD Although there is almost no relationship between each campaigns position on Israel and abortion I chose these examples because it should be shocking how varied the factions are in which the McCain campaign is trying to inspire fear PERIOD

Whats most disappointing though is the fear that McCains people have tried to instill with reference to acts of terrorism in the American people PERIOD We all know just how sensitive this country has become regarding national security and terrorism thus making the patriotic an easy target of the abuse of fear PERIOD Karl Rove sealed his reputation many years ago as the most backward and unethical political strategist in the history of the country PERIOD And thus when he is telling even the members of his own party that theyve gone too far one has to wonder how severe the consequences really are PERIOD
