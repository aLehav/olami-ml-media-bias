After the backlash against the Academy Awards for the lack of diversity in Oscar nominations and the planned protests of the ceremony by Jada Pinkett Smith and Spike Lee its safe to say that Hollywood has a race problem PERIOD

Olympian Jesse Owens the subject of the film Race which was released Feb PERIOD  is no stranger to race problems PERIOD

The black athlete competed in the  Olympic Games in Berlin while the Nazi Party was in power as the host country PERIOD The film documents Owens track career at Ohio State to his monumental achievements at the Olympics where he won four gold medals PERIOD

Beyond Adolf Hitlers disgust of Owen portrayed in the film Owen also faced racism at home in a segregated America PERIOD

Stephan James who plays Owens in the film is no stranger to playing historical characters PERIOD James also played civil rights leader John Lewis in the  film Selma. similar to the upcoming Academy Awards backlash occurred after Selma was not given a nomination for Best Picture in the  Awards PERIOD

I have to immerse myself in these roles James said PERIOD Whether its the 1960s in the Civil Rights Movement or in Nazi Germany PERIOD For me its more than just about research PERIOD Its about really living with these guys. some people saw the diversity problem in Hollywood being fixed internally especially in regard to the production of film PERIOD

The film industry is in need of more racial diversity especially within production Sim Carpenter the director of Public Relations for DePauls Black Student Union said PERIOD Having a raciallydiverse community of producers will have a direct influence on who the audience sees on the big screen. while the producers of Race were not racially diverse the themes the film brought up added to the conversation about race that is occurring in Hollywood PERIOD They did this by specifically featuring racist scenes in the film including the harassment of Owens and other black athletes at Ohio State University by the football team that did not allow black players PERIOD

The film also called out the concept of white privilege in a scene when Owens coach Larry Snyder Jason Sudeikis tells Owens he doesnt share his concerns about being a representative for his race and Owens responds Youre white PERIOD You dont have to. that was Jesse speaking to white privilege probably before we ever used the term Sudeikis said PERIOD

According to Sudeikis his character was referred to by Owens as an accidental nonracist in the runners biography and that phrase was what shaped his portrayal of Snyder PERIOD

The biggest gift outside of the story and the script that I was given was the line of Owens saying Larry was an accidental nonracist Sudeikis said about how he decided to portray his character PERIOD That term meant the world to me and that was all I needed. in addition to adding to the existing commentary the film strived for accuracy in the representation of Owens bringing in his reallife daughters to supervise the script PERIOD

I think they did a phenomenal job in embracing his character and projecting it Marlene Owens Rankin Owens daughter and managing director of the Jesse Owens Foundationsaid PERIOD They really wanted to make an important and beautiful and accurate film PERIOD And I think they did that. because the media has the ability to influence large groups of people at once we have to be careful with what we choose to highlight in films Carpenter said PERIOD It is also important that we do not play into societal prejudices by type casting. the Student News Site of DePaul University",‘Race’ contributes to discussion of diversity in film - The DePaulia,DePaul University
