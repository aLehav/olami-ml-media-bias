Scholars from across the world gathered virtually on Monday Feb PERIOD  to celebrate the launch of a new language revitalization journal PERIOD The Living Language Journal a multilingual and openaccess resource platformed by ScholarWorksUMass Amherst plans to host a variety of academic and nonacademic writings centering projects in the emerging field of language revitalization which aims to reengage with languages considered endangered by scholars and activists PERIOD

An estimated  percent of the worlds languages are endangered according to UNESCO PERIOD These minoritized languages  often Indigenous and lacking in institutional support  range from being classified as vulnerable to extinct denoting the varying degrees to which these languages have been lost PERIOD

Language revitalization the academic field dedicated to halting these declines in language engagement offers some solutions to these language crises through a diverse variety of programs that bring minoritized languages into the lives of their particular communities PERIOD When successful languages once considered critically endangered can reemerge in the lives of local community members PERIOD

Some of these programs have materialized within the local Massachusetts community PERIOD

Here in Massachusetts the Wampanoag language was not spoken for more than  years PERIOD And then this incredible woman jessie little doe baird decides to go into a masters degree in linguistics and then she creates a method to teach the language Luiz Amaral University of Massachusetts Amherst associate professor of Spanish and Portuguese linguistics and editorinchief of the Living Languages Journal said PERIOD Then she started her own teaching methods in her own school and now theres an immersion school in the language and there are children who are learning Wampanoag right here in Massachusetts. while this academic field and its ensuing revitalization projects have increased in recognition in recent years the field still faces major obstacles PERIOD According to Amaral one such obstacle is a lack of connection between the many communities engaging in revitalization projects PERIOD

Without this access to the efforts of other communities Amaral said that strategies and models developed within one group might not be able to help any number of other communities pursuing similar projects PERIOD The problem that was identified some years ago was that people who work with language revitalization in the local communities  language activists and people who are from the communities  sometimes have limited access to whats going on in other parts of the world or in other communities even in the same country. in order to achieve its goal Amaral noted it was important for the Living Languages Journal to emulate a less traditional model for an academic journal PERIOD

What we wanted to achieve was to create a place for people who work with language revitalization but are not necessarily connected to the academia or academic institutions  to not only share their experiences and the things that are working in their communities to revitalize their languages but  also to find information about the process thats been going on in other communities Amaral said PERIOD

To do so the journal combines the needs of an academic journal with the needs of practitioners and people in the field and publishes both academic research papers and personal narratives according to Amaral PERIOD We want the personal narratives in the chronicles and we want more researchoriented papers with a structural narrative that can teach us about these initiatives in a more academic wayAmaral said PERIOD

In another effort to make the Living Languages Journal easily accessible to a wide audience the journal is multilingual and is currently being published in English Spanish and Portuguese PERIOD To Amaral this choice to publish in a variety of languages resisted some values common to academia PERIOD

If youre talking about language revitalization we need to be a multilingual journal PERIOD And thats not easy for the North American academia to understand PERIOD North Americans and Americans in particular have this idea that if its not written in English why should I care. but academia is not centered around one language Amaral stated PERIOD

To Amaral this structure represents the widespread utility of the Living Languages Journal as a model for resistant decolonial academic work PERIOD

He said I think that our model is a very good concrete example of something that can be done in academia that embodies the mission of decolonization. tagged Sophie Soloway UMass Living Languages Language revitilization
