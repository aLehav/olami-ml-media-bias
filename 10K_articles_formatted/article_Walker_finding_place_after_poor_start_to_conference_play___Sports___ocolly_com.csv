OSU guard Rondel Walker had only scored  points in five conference games prior to Wednesdays 12point performance PERIOD

Rondel Walker looks a little different this season PERIOD

Not only is he sporting a new haircut but hes also not the same player he was last season PERIOD

Walker OSUs sophomore guard was a major factor for the Cowboys this past season averaging nearly eight points per game as well as being a dynamic defensive threat PERIOD Walker was scoring efficiently from the field  and from the 3point line  PERIOD

Now it looks a little different PERIOD His tally has dropped to  from the field and  from 3point range with little improvement being shown PERIOD

Despite the struggles offensively Walker continues to earn around  minutes a game with the help of his defense PERIOD Prior to Wednesdays contest with TCU he was averaging . steals per game tallying  across  contests PERIOD

Walker could see the work he was putting in to get back to the player he was for the Cowboys last season PERIOD It started by getting back to the basics PERIOD He was chipping away at a breakthrough PERIOD

One game it would click PERIOD

That day came Wednesday night PERIOD Walker scored  crucial points for the Cowboys in a narrow victory over TCU PERIOD

For me I just had to reset and get back to the basics be in the gym more and block out the outside noise Walker said PERIOD I feel like that is paying dividends right now. walkers  points was the first time he scored more than  points since Nov PERIOD  PERIOD It was just the second time since the beginning of Big  play in which he made more than two field goals PERIOD He had scored just  points total in five Big  games prior to his TCU performance PERIOD

Walker also tallied three steals three rebounds and a block in the game PERIOD

Coach Mike Boynton saw the progress his sophomore spark plug had made prior to his big outing on Wednesday PERIOD

I feel like he is making progress againHe obviously hadnt gotten off the start that he had hoped for and people expected from him PERIOD He kind of mired in a little bit of pity for a while I think PERIOD And I think once he started to figure out that it doesnt get better that way they started to focus on doing the things he can control but just bringing energy to our team and shooting the ball confidently. sports.edocolly.com
