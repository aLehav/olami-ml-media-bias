Bikes sit outside on January   in front of Nicholson Gateway PERIOD

LSU is similar to most other flagship universities in many regards as soon as one drives off the campus they are met with bars apartment complexes coffee shops and drivethrus for students to enjoy and partake in PERIOD

One thing that the University and its surrounding area lack though are safe bike lanes PERIOD Along most of the roads that surround campus even cars barely have a shoulder and those that are large enough to pull over into are covered in broken glass and other miscellaneous items PERIOD

The majority of student housing such as Arlington Cottages and Townhomes and The Lodges at 777is located south of campus along Lee Drive and Burbank Drive PERIOD Many other popular areas for students to live in are along Ben Hurr Road the Garden District and Southdowns making an average students commute anywhere from less than half a mile to  miles PERIOD

However the shortage of designated bike lanes often forces students to drive to campus instead of taking a maximum 20minute commute via bicycle contributing to Baton Rouges pollution problem and causing major traffic during busy hours of the day.As cars and trucks zoom by and cyclists have to breathe in exhaust this not only makes it unpleasant but also dangerous PERIOD

Baton Rouge tied for the forty-eighth most polluted city for shortterm particle pollution according to the American Lung Association PERIOD



LSU does have bike lanes on Skip Bertman Drive South Stadium Drive Tower Drive and Dalrymple Drive but those only make up a small portion of the 1000acre campus PERIOD

Without bike lanes students must bike on the street but many of the roads that surround the campus are state highways with high speed limits and lots of traffic PERIOD

The road you use to drive into campus is not typically the same one you would use to bike said Doug Moore president of Bike Baton Rouge.And a lot of those routes are state highways PERIOD Thats the main obstacle PERIOD Burbank Drive is a state highway and Nicholson Drive is also a state highway. as students are left with no other option besides riding on the shoulder of a state highway its only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured PERIOD Kinesiology graduate student Zachariah Wood was killed by a car while riding his bike on Lee Drive in  PERIOD Two Baton Rouge cyclists were killed in a span of  hours in  PERIOD

Kinesiology junior Andrew Roderich who drives to campus from the Wildwood Baton Rouge Apartments at5959 Burbank Drive was shocked to see a lack of sidewalks for runners and cyclists along Highland Road when he first arrived in Baton Rouge PERIOD

There needs to be more bike lanes created along roads leading up to campus Roderich said PERIOD Theres no one specific road that I could say needs a bike lane because frankly they all need one.I have friends who have biked in Baton Rouge and around the LSU campus and they felt scared by the dangerous trafficSubmit to let the Reveilles student journalists know PERIOD
