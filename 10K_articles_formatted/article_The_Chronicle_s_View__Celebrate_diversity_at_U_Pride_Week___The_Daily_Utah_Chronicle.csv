398,2023-10-23,"yesterday started this years U Pride Week sponsored by the Office of Diversity and the campus LGBT Resource Center PERIOD
Every year the same criticisms are made namely if theres a week highlighting diverse sexual orientations then there should be a straight week PERIOD Sometimes during International Week there are complaints about the lack of a white American week PERIOD
These comments are made by people reacting to situations on this campus PERIOD The insanity of these suggestions is only understandable if one applies the same logic to other campuses or places PERIOD
Imagine a Southern Pride Week at U Miss PERIOD A Surfing Week at UC Long Beach PERIOD Hindu Day in India PERIOD Muslim Day in Iran PERIOD Ocean Appreciation Week in Fiji PERIOD Black Pride Week at Florida AM University PERIOD Suburban Day in Sandy PERIOD Mormon Pride Week at BYU PERIOD
Who in their right mind would advocate adding White Straight Week at the U to this fictitious and facetious list
This ridiculous complaint aside what really irks people about Pride Week is the recognition of something sosoproblematic PERIOD
Its controversial to have a week honoring something that many on campus consider a sin PERIOD The debate over whether diverse sexual and gender orientations are chosen is scientifically inconclusive forcing the question to be addressed in ways plagued by relativism PERIOD
The fact of the matter is diversity is important PERIOD
Whether or not a student believes the issues addressed during Pride Week are something to be proud about it is indisputable that those issues are part of celebrating diversity PERIOD
Diversity means different PERIOD Our communitys gender and sexual minorities have perspectives experiences and beliefs that are different PERIOD That means they are inherently valuable to the U community PERIOD
Lets put aside the unanswerable and highly explosive questions surrounding whether or not to be proud during Pride Week and simply recognize that different is good PERIOD Different is something to be proud of PERIOD
