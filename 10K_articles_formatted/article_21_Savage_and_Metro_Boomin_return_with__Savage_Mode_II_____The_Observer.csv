Patrick Witteman  Friday October  

When  Savage and Metro Boomin released Savage Mode in  the hiphop and trap landscape was considerably different PERIOD In  Metro Boomin was key to the production of seminal projects like Futures DS2 and the FutureDrake collaboration tape What a Time to be Alive. although Metro had already entered into the mainstream  was at the very beginning of his meteoric rise PERIOD He had released projects like The Slaughter Tape and Slaughter King both of which contributed to his popularity on SoundCloud at the time PERIOD In June of  he was named to the XXL Freshman Class and in July of that year he released Savage Mode with Metro PERIOD Savage Mode propelled  to superstardom he followed that project up with the multiplatinum albums Issa Album and i am  i was. it never really felt like  had fully arrived though PERIOD Since the  release of i am  i was other trap artists like Gunna and Lil Baby have grown in popularity pushing trap away from Metro and 21s  sound PERIOD With Savage Mode II  Savage and Metro Boomin make a triumphant return once again placing themselves at the forefront of hiphop consciousness PERIOD Savage Mode II sounds like a victory lap with both artists performing at the highest level PERIOD

In terms of production Metros beats are head and shoulders above other  hip hop albums PERIOD  Savage is the beneficiary of Metros brilliance he has the space he needs to craft varied and interesting flows PERIOD On Runnin  is at his most aggressive while setting the tone for the rest of the album PERIOD Metro provides a venomous cold beat that hinges on an incredible Diana Ross sample PERIOD  invokes the original Savage Mode rapping Called the first one Savage Mode my mood thats what it was. it is clear that  and Metro arent taking any prisoners as they immediately come out of the gates sharp and focused PERIOD

I wouldnt be doing this album justice if I ignored Snitches  Rats and its interlude PERIOD Although  has clarified that this song wasnt meant to take direct aim at 6ix9ine it certainly reads like some type of diss track PERIOD The song is introduced like many are on this album with a Morgan Freeman interlude PERIOD The interlude written by spoken word artist Big Rube clarifies the difference between a regular citizen who reports seeing a crime a snitch and a rat PERIOD It is clear that  Savage reviles rats like 6ix9ine as Morgan Freeman ends his interlude by saying The difference is at least a snitch is human but a rat is a fn rat period. on Intro Morgan Freeman opines about Metro Boomin and 21s collective power PERIOD When great men with ideals join forces with the focus of reaching the same goals  they are not two but one PERIOD Instead of simply adding ones common attributes to anothers they somehow tend to multiply all attributes of both. from top to bottom Metro and  certainly multiply their attributes making Savage Mode II one of the standout releases of the year PERIOD The album has extraordinarily high playback value and I would definitely recommend giving it a listen
