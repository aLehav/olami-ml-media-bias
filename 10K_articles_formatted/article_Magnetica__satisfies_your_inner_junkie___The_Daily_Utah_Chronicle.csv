As part of their Touch Generation brand these new games allows potential players with limited to no knowledge of video games to pick up games such as Magnetica and get right into the thick of things PERIOD 
You dont need to worry about what the L and R button does and you dont need to know the complex origin of the characters that can only be explained by purchasing the last several editions of the game PERIOD All you need is your trusty stylusthat is if you havent lost it yet and a few minutes of quality time PERIOD And rest assured those few minutes will turn into hoursbecause while Magnetica has no learning curve the game can be surprisingly difficult and habit forming PERIOD You may even suffer from withdrawal when you finish playing PERIOD
The graphics and soundtrack of the game are very basic PERIOD Fortunately the DS allows you to turn the volume off and get passed the basic techno tracks if it is not your cup of tea PERIOD Dont feel guilty if you turn the sound down you can rest easier knowing somewhere out there Moby is playing this game and getting ready to sample it for his next album PERIOD 
And dont worry about the graphics either while they look like theyre straight out of a Super Nintendo game youll be focusing so much on the next few marbles it wont matter PERIOD Nintendos games have always been about game play over graphics and bless that little Italian plumbers heart the world is a better place because of it PERIOD 
After a few hours of Magnetica you wont care about what it looks like PERIOD You may even go about building your own wooden version to use to play with your grandparents PERIOD Theyre going to like this game too PERIOD
If youre lefthanded you may experience some issues using the stylus since it is the only way to play the game PERIOD Sometimes your hand may take up an important part of the screen that you should be paying attention to PERIOD And unfortunately you have to pay attention to everything if you want to beat this game PERIOD Magnetica is the type of game you crave to play at all hours of the day PERIOD If you get bored with one mode there are several other singleplayer modes of play and if you have other DS players in the area you can square off against them PERIOD Magnetica comes highly recommended for those of you looking for a sociallife substitute PERIOD If you find yourself with some downtime pop out the DS and get hooked on Magnetica. this way the next time someone approaches you to buy some drugs you can say No thanks man PERIOD I already have one. uWire
