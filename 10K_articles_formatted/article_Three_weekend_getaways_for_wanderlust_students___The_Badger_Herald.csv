The college lifestyle while immensely rewarding can often grow tiresome and monotonous PERIOD When beers and power lectures become less and less of a thrill fear not PERIOD Here are the most accessible weekend getaways that offer a change of pace and a sense of whats beyond campus

This cosmopolitan city only  miles away is in constant flux though the bread and butter culture of this classic Midwestern mecca remains the same PERIOD Here are some ideas for the perfect budget Chicago weekend

.Take the Van Galder or Megabus to Union Station PERIOD The oneway fare is often lessthan  but early Friday morning buses mighthave single digit fares PERIOD

.The material excess of overcrowded Michigan Avenue fails to provide any glimpse at the real Chicago PERIOD Instead steer clear and head west on the L Chicagos aboveground metro to Oak Park for a full day of cultural assimilation PERIOD

.If onegoes before Labor Day the unofficial end to Chicago beach season Oak Street Beach a haven for runners swimmers and sunbathers alike is sure to deliver PERIOD

 PERIOD Visit theunfrequented Lakeview neighborhood the birthplace of Charlie Chaplin and one of Chicagos liveliest neighborhoods PERIOD See the Athenaeum Theater a small classically designed venue PERIOD In between childrens ballerina productions there may be a writers panel Neil Simon production or Internet cat video festival so check the schedule PERIOD

This glaciated area containing just about everything an outdoor enthusiast looks for in an expedition is close enough to be a feasible weekend trip PERIOD Located roughly  miles east of Madison the forest is divided into two areas the Northern and Southern Units PERIOD

The Northern a rural and spacious landscape includes more than  miles of hiking trails snowmobile and equestrian trails and two campgrounds at Mauthe and Long Lake PERIOD The area also includes a large section of the Ice Age Trail in the Southern Unit PERIOD

For those wholike backpacking there are three hikein shelters in the Southern unit that promise seclusion save for the decent cell reception PERIOD

St PERIOD Paul Minneapolis smaller eastern twin contains enough to entertain any culturally inclined weekender PERIOD Although the four hour trip is a bitlong one of Americas most literate cities is certainly worth the trip PERIOD

.While not blessed with the convenience of Chicagos public transportation St PERIOD Pauls fewer square miles make Uber and buses doable and with the recent addition of the light rails green line from Target Center to Union Depot downtown its possible to traverse most of the city without much hassle PERIOD

.In the downtown Riverfront area along the Mississippi River sits the the Science Museum of Minnesota containing a world of relevant quirky content like Body Worlds and Tutankhamen PERIOD

Also in the neighborhood is the Xcel Energy Center blessed with excellent acoustics for a facility of its size PERIOD Often a stop on tours of some of the biggest names in entertainment the stadium is also home to the Minnesota Wild and various outdoors festivals PERIOD

.Grand Avenue seemingly straight out of a Woody Allen movie has enough bourgeois bliss to give even Minneapolis a run for its money PERIOD Familiar chains J PERIOD Crew and Caribou have locations on Grand but what draws visitors are eclectic places like The Wild Onion Izzys Ice Cream and Sixth Chamber Used Books PERIOD

.Mancinis is a must for any foodie PERIOD With some of the best charcoal grilled steaks in the cities this bastion of St PERIOD Paul cuisine wont disappoint PERIOD
