8465,2023-11-05,"p PERIOD Junior Zach Pilchens student assembly presidential campaign platform has apparently worked twice here at the College and also at James Madison University PERIOD

p PERIOD The majority of my platform ideas were taken from the Student Assembly campaign of Zach Pilchen and Valerie Hopkins at the College of William and Mary Brandon Eickel JMUs student government president wrote in a letter to students there PERIOD I would like to take this opportunity to publicly apologize to Zach and Valerie as well as the JMU community for not making this clear last spring during my campaign. p PERIOD Eight of the  bulleted initiatives listed on Eickels campaign website  which was taken off the internet at the request of Pilchen  are nearly identical to those listed on the Pilchen campaign website PERIOD

p PERIOD For example Pilchens site states Zach started a composting program with dining services to turn leftover food into nutrientrich compost for William and Mary flower beds. eickels site which went online during the last days of Pilchens campaign states I would like to start a composting program with dining services in order to turn leftover food into nutrientrich compost for JMUs flowerbeds and trees. p PERIOD Eickel also uses several unusual phrases that are nearly identical to phrases used on Pilchens site such as Some RAs perceive their role to be that of pseudopolice officers. p PERIOD In an email to The Flat Hat Eickel said that he wanted to incorporate great ideas from other schools into his campaign PERIOD I felt as if my ability to make these things happen on JMUs campus was more significant than where the ideas originated he wrote PERIOD I realize this situation should have been handled differently recognize my mistake and have fully taken responsibility. p PERIOD Pilchen said yesterday that he heard last spring that Eickels campaign website was wellconstructed and that he wanted to check it out for himself PERIOD He said that as he read through the site he realized many of the ideas and phrases were taken directly from his own campaign website PERIOD

p PERIOD I talked to him and asked him to pull down the website and issue a clarification to JMU Pilchen said adding that he did not want to get further involved in the situation PERIOD JMU will have to work it out for themselves. p PERIOD Mallory Micetich a senator in JMUs student government said that the student government there stands behind Eickel PERIOD It takes a twothirds vote to impeach and I know there arent twothirds that want to impeach him she said PERIOD Hes accepting full responsibility and personally I believe hes doing it with extreme integrity. p PERIOD Brandons a great guy and we want William and Mary to know that he never meant to do it in anything other than a flattering manner she added PERIOD

p PERIOD Ilk Ghavami who ran a writein campaign against Eickel and lost by a margin of approximately  points said he believes Eickel may have had motivations for plagiarizing other than just bringing new ideas to JMU PERIOD It seems as though his intent was to get elected Ghavami said PERIOD Maybe he thought that because the William and Mary election was over this would go under the table. p PERIOD He said that he hopes JMU students take the situation seriously PERIOD

p PERIOD Its wrong PERIOD He cheated he plagiarized and now he needs to face the consequences Ghavami said PERIOD I feel that this shouldnt be forgotten because this tarnishes the image that JMU has. p PERIOD Because student politics are not part of academic coursework Ghavami said Eickel most likely would not be tried for plagiarism by the schools honor council PERIOD

p PERIOD The Colleges honor council chair Judd Kennedy  said yesterday that if a similar situation occurred at the College the honor council would have jurisdiction PERIOD

p PERIOD Our process is a little bit different from JMUs he said noting that the honor code holds students accountable for both their academic work and their personal lives PERIOD When anyone directly plagiarizes and asserts that someone elses work is their own its taken very seriously by the council. p PERIOD Eickels brother Ryan Eickel  is an SA Senator at the College PERIOD
