Firstyears and Resident Advisers RAs alike have expressed frustration regarding the inaugural run of the First Year Residential Experience FYRE program managed by Residential Education and Housing Services ResEd PERIOD

When its so blatantly obvious its not going to work whats the point a firsttime RA said who agreed to an interview on condition of anonymity in order to maintain RA privileges PERIOD

The program designed to be a continuation of Orientation requires firstyear students to meet once a week to discuss a variety of college issues such as sexual misconduct alcohol consumption and healthy relationships PERIOD

In general were hoping the students are more educated about the resources here on campus and how to use them Director of Residential Education and Housing Services Chad Myers said PERIOD

Although ResEd spent much of the past summer preparing for its FYRE sessions several unanticipated problems have emerged such as the large size of the discussion groups PERIOD

I dont know all their names yet and I probably wont remember them after were done PERIOD Why arent the groups smaller the same anonymous RA said PERIOD FYRE groups contain a maximum of  students about twice the size of an OTeam and larger than most seminar classes at Occidental PERIOD However ResEd claims these groups are the smallest they can be PERIOD

We took the incoming firstyear class and divided that by the number of FirstYear RAs PERIOD We have  FirstYear staff members so we needed  people max per class to fit all the firstyears Myers said PERIOD

Originally the leaders of FYRE were going to be volunteers similar to being an OTeam or OxyEngage leader but ResEd decided to limit the program to RAs in firstyear halls PERIOD They also changed the original plan of offering FYRE leaders school credit for their work PERIOD Now RAs do not receive compensation for the additional hours of work they have to put into the FYRE sessions PERIOD

There are no rewards and it was completely sprung on us the anonymous RA said noting the fact that RA applicants were not alerted that they would be responsible for FYRE sessions until job training had already commenced PERIOD

The educational resources ResEd provides to the RAs in order to assist with FYRE meetings have received mixed feedback as well PERIOD

ResEd creates the structured curriculum PERIOD Some of the activities are surfacelineIve brought in extra sources and materials to make them go deeper a second firstyear RA said who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his or her employment PERIOD

Despite its educational intent FYRE has actually had the opposite effect on many firstyear students due to the redundancy of covering topics discussed in other mandatory sessions like Think About It and Orientation PERIOD

Its been drilled into us so many timespeople dont take it seriously Anya Weis firstyear said PERIOD

Firstyears who do not show up to a FYRE session or complete the online component have a hold placed on their student account PERIOD After the FYRE program ends on Oct PERIOD  students who have holds on their account will get the chance to go to a makeup FYRE session during the following two weeks PERIOD By making the program mandatory ResEd hopes to make sure the whole firstyear class benefits from it PERIOD

I dont think the program can be a failure PERIOD Weve succeeded just by them having the conversations Myers said PERIOD

Students will soon get the opportunity to provide feedback on FYRE as ResEd plans to administer a program assessment survey with the Office of Institutional Research Assessment and Planning after the last week of FYRE is complete PERIOD
