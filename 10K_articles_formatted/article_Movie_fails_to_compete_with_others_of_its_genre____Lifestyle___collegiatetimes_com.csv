There are few things more entertaining than a good Quentin Tarantino film PERIOD

Unfortunately there is also little worse than a badly made Tarantino ripoff PERIOD

Of course that is not to imply that he owns the market on neogrind house and obsessively referential gorefests PERIOD But it is hard not to look at a film coproduced and cowritten by Tarantino protg Eli Roth that is marketed as Quentin Tarantino presents and conclude that maybe someone is trying a little too hard PERIOD

The Man with the Iron Fists is the directorial debut of RZA who is better known for his career as a rapper with WuTang Clan PERIOD

RZAs music is big  cinematic even  and he is an incredibly talented producer PERIOD

However you cannot slice and dice and mix up a twohour movie the way you can a five minute song RZA tries this method and the result is simply a mess PERIOD

The Man with the Iron Fists tells the story of The Blacksmith RZA who lives in a nineteenth century Chinese village that is threatened by clans fighting over a fortune of gold PERIOD

A traitorous leader of the Lion Clan Bryon Mann chops off The Blacksmiths forearms PERIOD The Blacksmith then fashions two iron fists and takes on the villains with the help of an Englishman called Jack Knife Russell Crowe and the son of the recently murdered Golden Lion Rick Yune PERIOD

In its own way the movie is a lot of fun to watch PERIOD

It is exploitative in its gratuitous and graphic violence the scantily clad women and the complete disregard for anything resembling historical accuracy or cultural sensitivity PERIOD For example a mans arms are torn from their sockets in excruciating freezeframe detail within a minute of the opening credits and most of the action takes place in the Pink Blossom brothel PERIOD

This alone is not enough to condemn the movie PERIOD I could not profess to be a fan of Quentin Tarantino without a healthy appreciation for exploitative movies and all that they entail PERIOD

But any movie regardless of how many pints of blood splash across the screen or how offensive the depictions of a culture are needs several things to be successful a tight script clear plot coherent camera work strong sound and skillful acting PERIOD

The Man with the Iron Fists fails miserably on virtually all accounts PERIOD

Most shocking is the mess of a plot PERIOD The storyline is so unclear that it leaves you constantly feeling like you missed some vital explanatory scene PERIOD There are far too many characters essentially none of whose motivations or backstory made clear PERIOD

The script itself is not inherently awful PERIOD Many lines are delightfully cheesy and RZAs choice to have a narrator was definitely the right one PERIOD

But on the whole it is a dud and it simply cannot overcome the confusing and convoluted plot PERIOD

Adding to confusion is the camera work PERIOD RZAs lack of experience betrays him here more than anywhere else as he tries  and fails  to emulate the fast moving jumpcuts and splitscreens of better martial arts movies PERIOD

On top of that shoddy sound again compounds the muddle of this movie PERIOD The dialogue in many scenes is muffled leaving audience members unable to make out the words of the actors especially RZA himself PERIOD

Unfortunately it cannot even be said that RZA was competent as an actor PERIOD To be honest he could give Keanu Reeves a run for his money for the most mindnumbingly boring and expressionless acting PERIOD

The rest of the main cast largely appears wooden and uninspired as well PERIOD Lucy Liu manages to make a backstabbing brothels Madame dull even in the midst of a fight scene PERIOD Bryon Manns Silver Lion the new leader of the Lion Clan is the victim of most of the scripts atrocious oneliners and is memorable only for his bizarrely close resemblance to rocker Steven Tyler PERIOD

The one bright spot is Russell Crowe who while obviously not putting out a performance worthy of an Oscar is actually having fun with his character PERIOD

If you approach The Man with the Iron Fists as a cheap exploitation Bmovie and nothing more it is a fun watch PERIOD It is loud and bloody enough to keep the audiences attention for the 96minute runtime PERIOD

Do not expect much beyond that PERIOD The film is ultimately forgettable and easily lost amongst the numerous other neogrindhouse movies PERIOD
