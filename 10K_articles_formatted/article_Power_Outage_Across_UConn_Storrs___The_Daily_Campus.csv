All nonessential employees were told to remain home and complete work remotely UConn Spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said PERIOD

The outage was the result of a problem with an underground highvoltage line on campus Reitz said PERIOD There were no reported injuries PERIOD

Workers were repairing the line on Monday however Reitz said the repairs are rather lengthy and more complex than what would result from a typical power outage PERIOD

All operations and classes across UConns regional campuses including Hartford Stamford Avery Point Waterbury UConn Health and the School of Law have not been affected Reitz said PERIOD

However as of  p.m PERIOD on Monday UConn Alert announced that power wasrestored across the UConn Storrs campus PERIOD

Workers continue to repair damaged electrical infrastructure but that work is being done mainly underground and will not affect traffic or any campus operations Reitz said PERIOD

Only buildings that were fed the specific high voltage line and its related equipment were affected PERIOD The buildings that were fed by that affected circuit have since been moved to other circuits Reitz said PERIOD
