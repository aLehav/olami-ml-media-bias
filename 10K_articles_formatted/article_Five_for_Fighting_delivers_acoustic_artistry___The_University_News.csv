Easy Tonight the first song sounds much like the title track but the subject matter is not as soft the song is about suicide PERIOD 

Dont let it get you down because the album picks after Bloody Mary and Superman. bloody Mary is a smartly crafted song about apathy and Superman is for everyone striving for greatness but then losing oneself on the way PERIOD 

Do not let the themes deceive you the music and instrumentals could carry the album PERIOD All of them are upbeat melodic and whimsical PERIOD 

Something About You is a love song written for his wife and son PERIOD Jainy is the hook song about loneliness with clever guitar riffs and catchy lyrics PERIOD

The remarkable thing about the album is that it is laced with political commentary irony and doubt but the songs still get the toes tapping PERIOD

 It is a rare feat to find both a positive beat and deep lyrics in the same record PERIOD 

Michael Jordan is about gaining the world by sacrificing yourself PERIOD The vocals and key are different from many of the other songs PERIOD You definitely sense an identity theme transcending the album as well as a running commentary on America PERIOD 

It is obvious that his fight with big business has jaded his view on America PERIOD The Last Great American is a song about an American hero so disillusioned with the country that he fought for that he buries himself in his own coffin PERIOD 

If you like great music strong lyrics and a great balance of love disillusionment despair and joy check out America Town PERIOD
