8461,2023-11-05,"the William and Mary Promise a new operating model for the College of William and Mary was approved by the Board of Visitors Friday promoting what BOV members called an ironclad tuition guarantee for instate students PERIOD

One aspect of the new model targets instate student tuition aiming to reduce the net tuition paid by middleclass families or those earning less than four times the poverty level per year on average PERIOD

Starting with the incoming class of  instate students will enter the College under the new fouryear tuition guarantee PERIOD Tuition will be set for their first year and will remain constant for all successive undergraduate years spent at the College PERIOD The board approved the tuition rate for three incoming classes PERIOD The class of  will face a tuition of  while the class of  and the class of  will face a tuition price of  and  respectively PERIOD

For current instate students the new promise plans to hold annual tuition increases to no greater than the rate of inflation which sets  tuition for returning instate students at  PERIOD

Outofstate students also saw an increase in prices with a  percent rise in the costs of tuition and fees for a total of  PERIOD

Incoming instate students however will not encounter any fluctuations in price PERIOD

An ironclad tuition guarantee The first of its kind of any public university in America BOV Finance Committee Chair Todd Stottlemeyer  said PERIOD We hope students and parents will respond favorably to this PERIOD We believe they will because of that guarantee of knowing what youre going to pay in year one and knowing what youre going to pay in year four. an additional  instate students will be enrolled at the College over the next four years PERIOD Coupled with the statemandated increase of  instate students over the past few years the College will have seen an  percent increase in instate enrollment since  PERIOD

Vice President for Finance Sam Jones noted the increase in enrollment will not affect class sizes at the College since the administration plans to increase fulltime professor positions at the College to compensate for the enrollment growth PERIOD

Well add some fulltime faculty slots to go along with that enrollment growth Jones said PERIOD The intent is that were not changing the studentfaculty ratio with this. the College also intends to increase faculty salaries based on merit over the next few years with a goal of moving faculty salaries from the seventeenth percentile in  to the fifty-first percentile by  PERIOD

BOV member Robert Scott J.D PERIOD  drew on his experiences as a law professor who teaches about contracts to elaborate on the reciprocal nature of the Colleges new promise both to raise faculty salaries and increase productivity PERIOD

The legal definition of a promise is a manifestation of an intention to act so made that it justifies the recipient in believing that the commitment has been made Scott said PERIOD And by accepting this infusion of dollars from incoming students the faculty and staff here at the College are making a reciprocal promise PERIOD  A promise that in short they can and will enhance the teaching mission of the university without sacrificing in any respect the commitment to scholarship so essential to making this a great liberal arts university. the BOV approved the new plan with one member Pete Snyder  voting the measure down PERIOD

Snyder noted any tuition increases in the current economic environment discouraged him from approving the measure PERIOD

Making higher education a more affordable option for all Virginia students should be our number one priority as Board of Visitors members Snyder said in a statement PERIOD While the plan will reduce net tuition for middle income families below  in annual income I believe we must go deeper into the middle class to provide tuition relief and that no increases in tuition are warranted in these very tough and uncertain economic times PERIOD Because of this I cannot support this resolution and must vote no. college President Taylor Reveley supported the new plan emphasizing the need for collaboration between faculty staff alumni and students to implement the new model PERIOD

We know William and Mary going forward must largely see to its own financial future Reveley said PERIOD Its William and Marys great good fortune that we have the capacity to fend for ourselves but this will take a powerful constellation of three groups PERIOD First of campus productivity gains from our faculty and staff PERIOD Second of heightened philanthropic support of our alumni and friends PERIOD And third more earned income from students who benefit from the extraordinary education William and Mary provides always coupled with the needbased aid for students unable to pay. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
