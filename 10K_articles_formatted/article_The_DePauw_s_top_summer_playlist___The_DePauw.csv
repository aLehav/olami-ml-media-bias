Deny it as much as you will theres probably a playlist on your iTunes side bar right now titled Summer . with the end of summer just around the corner youve probably had it on repeat because the songs hold more than music they hold memories PERIOD

While most of us were counting down the days to return to DePauw no one wants the sand and the sun to end so sit back relax and let these songs take you back to those long summer nights PERIOD

 Fancy Iggy Azalea

The Australian hiphop sensation hit the charts this summer and she hit them hard PERIOD With three songs already on the Billboard Top  Azaleas debut was a surefire success PERIOD This single the first from her debut album The New Classic features a unique electropop vibe PERIOD Azaleas sound is definitely something out of the ordinary so its not a surprise that she is starting to get called the new Miley by the music industry PERIOD

 Rude MAGIC

If you listened to the radio this summer chances are you got in the car turned it on and this song was playing PERIOD Rude quickly became a summer hit at the beginning of June and radio stations would be playing the tune at the top of every hour PERIOD MAGIC Is a Canadian reggae fusion band a genre we dont typically tend to see on the charts but that seems to add to its addictive nature PERIOD The melody is a sound so different from the everyday pop songs that you cant help but blast it and bob your head to the music PERIOD

 Happy Pharrell Williams

This is the song you want to hate but when it comes on the radio it you cant help but sing the lyrics PERIOD Then for the next hour youre still humming the chorus but all you want is for it to stop PERIOD If you thought Rude was overplayed then your ears probably bled when this song started playing on the radio PERIOD Regardless the song is also the sound track to Despicable Me  and its hard to stay mad when you think about how cute the minions are when they dance to this PERIOD

 Problem Ariana Grande featuring Iggy Azalea

This pop princess is swiftly rising into stardom and she cant be stopped. within the past year the Florida native went from Nickelodeon child star to multi platinum music artist PERIOD Problem is one of the many singles Grande released this summer that went viral PERIOD The single is noted for having a throwback type of tone mimicking music from the 90s PERIOD Take Grandes powerhouse belts throw in Iggy Azalea rapping and youve got yourself a Grammy PERIOD

 Beachin Jake Owen

A summer playlist wouldnt be complete without a country song after all the song is called Beachin PERIOD This particular tune is a change of pace for Owen because it also incorporates a rap element PERIOD Most people would think that country and rap wouldnt mix very well but after hearing this song they will think otherwise PERIOD Besides whats a summer adventure without stepping outside of your comfort zone
