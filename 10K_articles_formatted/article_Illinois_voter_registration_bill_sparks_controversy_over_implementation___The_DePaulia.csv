Automatic voter registration seemed to be the only thing Illinois state Democrats and Republicans could agree on in  PERIOD The bill received not only bipartisan but unanimous support by state senators making Illinois the tenth state to sign in automatic voter registration in August  PERIOD

Throughout the process of implementation however many advocates have had concerns with how the Secretary of States office has carried out the bills provisions PERIOD

The initial criticism was with the delay of implementation which state officials tied to Illinois struggle to roll out Real ID PERIOD While the law set an original deadline of July  most provisions were not enacted until July  PERIOD

Advocates are now concerned with what they describe as unnecessary roadblocks the secretary of states office has included in the registration process PERIOD

Currently citizens have access to an optout model of automatic voter registration when receiving a Real ID when citizens receive a Real ID they are automatically registered to vote unless they choose not to PERIOD

There is an optin process when getting a standard drivers license or state ID in Illinois PERIOD Citizens need to check a box and sign their name attesting to citizenship to ensure that noncitizens dont accidentally get registered according to Matt Dietrich spokesperson for the Illinois Board of Elections PERIOD

But during the process Illinoisans are required to submit a second signature  something advocates of automatic voter registration are wary of and feel is a requirement unrelated to voter eligibility PERIOD

Real ID and standard ID applicants sign their names electronically at the beginning of the process and sign their name on a paper form later according to Ami Gandi senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights PERIOD The paper form is then scanned in and uploaded PERIOD

According to Secretary of State spokesperson Dave Druker this signature is necessary to protect against noncitizen voter registration PERIOD The office claims that this signature bars not only accidental registration but also deportation for committing a felony  voting without citizenship PERIOD

Our point has been that people who are eligible for a drivers license may not be eligible to vote Druker said PERIOD

Because the secretary of states office cannot ask applicants in advance if theyre U.S PERIOD citizens the process includes two boxes to be checked one saying an individual is above the age of  and the other that they are a U.S PERIOD citizen PERIOD Then the second signature PERIOD

But some advocates say the extra signature is unrelated to citizenship affirmation and doesnt prove citizenship with proper implementation of the bill and engagement of community organizations both the optout and optin processes should be safer for noncitizens PERIOD

Just Democracy a coalition of organizations pushing for the removal of the second signature is comprised of nonpartisan immigrant rights organizations PERIOD Gandi said they receive regular input from immigrant community members about the safeguards they would like to see so that both immigrant citizens do not have access to voting and noncitizens are not accidentally ensnared in the voting registration process PERIOD

Under no circumstances do any of us want to see community members deported for improper voter registration or engagement Gandi said PERIOD Just Democracy knows better than the secretary of states office what is going to be the real harm in communities noncitizens should be able to show documentation and they should be screened out of the voter registration process. we take very seriously the importance of protecting immigrant community members she added PERIOD But that does not excuse adding signature requirements or other bureaucratic steps that are unrelated to checking or ensuring voter eligibility. druker said theres nothing illegal with adding more signatures PERIOD But extra regulations like these Gandi said typically end up affecting disenfranchised communities including communities of color PERIOD

Theres a history of American voter suppression of communities of color PERIOD Requirements like multipage registration forms and multiple forms of ID have been used in southern states to make voting seem more intimidating PERIOD Literacy tests and poll taxes werent banned until the Voting Rights Act of  PERIOD In Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp was sued in  for holding nearly  voting registration applications made up mostly of minority voters because of Georgias exactmatch law during his gubernatorial campaign PERIOD

Any extra steps in the registration process beyond what the law requires ends up increasing barriers to voter registration for historically disenfranchised communities Gandi said PERIOD

Druker disagrees that this process discriminates PERIOD

It takes  seconds to check off those two boxes to say yes do you want to vote and sign the form he said PERIOD I cant see how anybody has been discriminated against. jay Young executive director of Common Cause Illinois an organization part of Just Democracy cites basic human psychology as an important aspect of limiting barriers PERIOD

The human brain doesnt like obstacles you want to make it as easy and as seamless as possible he said PERIOD You dont want to make peoplejump through as many hoops. additionally according to the Board of Elections a part of the bill that instates optin processes at other agencies has only been partially implemented PERIOD

While the bill has registered around  voters since July  according to the Department of Voter Registration advocates believe effective implementation could specifically limit barriers to disenfranchised communities PERIOD

This effective implementation of the law would include reforms like proper language access training employees to answer applicant questions and making the system as streamlined and electronic as possible to keep it from being confusing PERIOD

Its profoundly frustrating Young said PERIOD Particularly in a time when we have all this idea whether real or not that the government is not designed to work for you and automatic voter registration is designed to push back against that. correction Jan PERIOD  An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the Illinois Board of Elections as the Department of Voter Registration PERIOD
