Dear Goldman Sachs

I have some advice for you Find Osama Bin Laden and find him fast PERIOD

While youre at it cure herpes too PERIOD

Thats what its going to take for you to stay in business because right now youre being charged with securities fraud PERIOD And whether or not youre convicted the chances anyone is going to trust you with their money now is slim to none PERIOD Personally Id rather shop at the bank of Afghan President Hamad Karzai PERIOD

Its not that you represent Wall Street Gone Wild its that you represent Wall Street Gone Immoral. newly released emails show how you packaged the worst mortgages  the ones most likely to see the homeowner default  and sold them to your own customers in the form of securities PERIOD Knowing you built a crappy product you illegally took out insurance on these securities known as creditdefault swaps so that when they went bust your bank would rake in huge returns from say American International Group who provided the insurance PERIOD

The most common analogy the media has given for this tactic is that it was like you took out fire insurance on your neighbors home and then set their home on fire PERIOD

You told your investors the securities were created by an independent manager but they werent PERIOD A man named John A PERIOD Paulson who happened to make . billion betting against the housing market was responsible for creating them PERIOD

It was a great plan until you got greedy and took out too much insurance PERIOD So much so that AIG went bankrupt PERIOD

Fearing some sort of cataclysmic financial meltdown the government decided to put taxpayers like myself on the hook for your bailout of roughly  billion PERIOD

Internal emails show how many top officials within your bank gloated about having the big short on the housing market PERIOD Committing fraud is one thing but bragging about it as you squander the wealth of your own customers away is another PERIOD By the way having these sort of embarrassing emails around so soon after emails sunk the marriages of Tiger Woods and Jesse James is pathetic PERIOD

Consider your now infamous bond trader Fabrice Tourre PERIOD Emails he sent to his girlfriend proved he knowingly sold crappy products PERIOD Tourre wrote in a March   email the poor little subprime borrowers will not last so long

In another email Tourre boasted Just made it to the country of your favorite clients Im managed sic to sell a few abacus bonds to widow and orphans that I ran into at the airport

Fortunately for Tourre he doesnt need to worry about going to hell because not even the devil wants his depraved soul PERIOD

This week as your bank attempted to justify its unethical behavior before Congress Michigan D Sen PERIOD Carl Levin asked one your senior executives Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell a shitty deal to its customers

Im not writing about that to criticize your answer just to congratulate you on reaching that point in life where Congress  of all institutions  is lecturing you on morality PERIOD

If that doesnt tell you that what you were doing was entirely effed up I dont know what does PERIOD

Sorry there are no recent results for popular commented articles PERIOD
