According to professor of art history Alexis L PERIOD Boylan youve probably viewed an Ellen Emmet Rand painting at a college in a house of government or hanging on the wall of a major companys headquarters PERIOD Chances are youve seen oneyou just dont know it PERIOD

Throughout her lecture on Rands style and conception of race and gender at the William Benton Museum of Art Wednesday evening Boylan talked about the artists unique story and why it deserves to be remembered PERIOD For Boylan who curated the exhibit it is just as important to remember the portraitist as it is to remember the high society figures she painted PERIOD

Ellen Emmet Rand was in the business of not forgetting of making objects that would make people remember Boylan said PERIOD As a portrait painter her weekly work her lifes work was to ensure that people would be seen in perpetuity. more specifically Boylan discussed the reasons to remember Rands history accurately stating how Rands life does not fit into the typical narrative of a rediscovered female artist PERIOD

The typical recovered female artist would be radical and progressive before being thwarted by forces out of her control the central agent of which inevitably tend to be a male lover or husband whose own artmaking and career dominates her life Boylan said PERIOD

In addition to this undoing her children are often said to distract the typical recovered female artist from her work PERIOD However this artist will continue to create art and her glory will lie simply in her artworks survival PERIOD Eventually some art historian or curator will rediscover her work and apply this narrative to her life in order to explain why she is not as famous as others PERIOD

In contrast to this standard narrative which Boylan described as narrow and repetitive Ellen Emmet Rand refused to be seen as a victim PERIOD She held conservative politics enjoyed her children maintained a difficult marriage and aspired to money all while painting portraits of some of the most powerful and influential figures of early twentieth century America including President Franklin Delano Roosevelt PERIOD

I really like how Professor Boylan noted that it doesnt really fit the feminist image of Oh a feminist painter but Rand still had a family and kids and all that and how it doesnt fit but its still important to know to bring these women artists into view eighthsemester fine arts photography major Tiffany Taylor said PERIOD

Boylans second major point was that artists like Ellen Emmet Rand should be rewilded an ecological term that indicates the reintroduction of a previously present but currently absent species into an environment PERIOD When applying the term to Rand Boylan explained that instead of fitting the artists life to a preconstructed narrative those who see her work today should consider how Rand mattered as a painter in her own moment and how her work now matters in the present PERIOD

Students found the presentation engaging and said they learned much about Rands life and memory from it PERIOD

You think like back in the day not that many women were artists so even though they were out there I feel like I didnt know that they were still so accomplished so it was kind of surprising that she was so famous but then also disappointing because its like she was and now shes not secondsemester digital media and design major Heather Rutishauser said PERIOD

Though Rutishauser noted her disappointment that Rand is largely unremembered Boylans work to display Rands work goes a long way in helping modern audiences to remember the portraitist PERIOD The exhibition The Business of Bodies Ellen Emmet Rand  and the Persuasion of Portraiture will be on display at the Benton until March  PERIOD
