Every Open Eye  Chvrches

I fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once. thats what listening to Chvrches second album Every Open Eyes feels like PERIOD John Green and The Fault in Our Stars references aside when the records first single Leave A Trace hit the airwaves on July  it was likable and nice to hear something new from the Scottish breakout band PERIOD

A month later Never Ending Circles brought a little more excitement PERIOD The first inklings of success could be felt PERIOD

Then once the album was released at the end of September after one thorough listen I was hooked PERIOD

The sound that made Mother That We Share a Tumblr dream is still there but Chvrches has grown their alternative electropop sound PERIOD

The trio has softened their sound but not their edge on Every Open Eye. chvrches now has the feel of a seasoned more authentic outfit PERIOD The male voices of Iain Cook and Martin Doherty also take a more prominent stance on this album balancing lead vocalist Lauren Mayberrys sweet feminine vocals PERIOD Though the band is still  percent electronica Mayberrys voice is less electronicized than on The Bones of What You Believe. its a reminder to the listener that the members of Chvrches are actually genuinely talented musicians  also a reminder that electronic music is more than just computer generated beeps and boops PERIOD Just FYI PERIOD

The 80s influenced synth heavy electropop that Chvrches has perfected can be heard duplicated across genres as other indie artists look to find commercial success as well PERIOD Its propelled their sound into the mainstream even more so Mayberrys battle with sexism on the Internet also made her a cool feminist for the Tumblr generation PERIOD

If anything though Every Open Eye is more indie than The Bones of What You Believe. its a genrebending and blending experiment with successful results PERIOD It works for riding in your car studying or dancing on a Friday night PERIOD Chalk it up to heightened press coverage a mature sound or just pure brilliance but Chvrches just gets better with age PERIOD
