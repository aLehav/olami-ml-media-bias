by  Emma CarewPublished  January  

Students reapplying for University housing for  should read the fine print PERIOD

University Housing and Residential Life has in an attempt to be more up front about its valueschanged its alcohol policy for the coming school year said Susan Stubblefield assistant director of Housing and Residential Life PERIOD

Next year most residence halls will be alcoholfree regardless of the ages of the residents PERIOD

The new alcohol policy allows students of legal drinking age to possess and consume alcohol in the residential apartments Roy Wilkins Hall University Village Yudof Hall and Centennial Hall Stubblefield said PERIOD

The policy change has been in the works for more than a year she said and the housing department developed a task force to look into the current state of alcoholrelated incidents on campus PERIOD

Wachen Anderson judicial affairs coordinator for Housing and Residential Life said that because of time constraints the housing department did not consider student input while making the decision PERIOD

There certainly are areas where we do seek student opinion she said PERIOD But with this we knew which direction we needed to go. the policy change will affect about  students Stubblefield said and most of them are community advisers PERIOD

As the Universitys housing has expanded she said apartments have been increasingly inhabited by upperclassmen more of whom are of legal drinking age and the traditional residence halls have been geared toward firstyear students PERIOD

The housing department chose to include Centennial Hall with the apartments because the hall has the greatest number of single rooms PERIOD Also many upperclassmen looking for a traditional residence hall experience can choose to live there Stubblefield said PERIOD

I think the changes will make students more aware of the policy Residential Housing Association President Collin Bonde said PERIOD

The current policy is a little ambiguous for some halls he said PERIOD

Now theres no if ands or buts about it because you cant have alcohol there Bonde said about the residence halls PERIOD

About a year and a half ago the department began looking into the firstyear student experience and what really defined substancefree Stubblefield said PERIOD

Currently Territorial Hall and Frontier Hall as well as parts of Bailey Hall and Sanford Hall are dry living communities because they are firstyear student housing PERIOD

Students also will have the opportunity to reside in living and learning communities on the East Bank and West Bank that will focus on substancefree activities and programs she said PERIOD

One community will be in Middlebrook Hall on the West Bank and one will be in Pioneer Hall on the East Bank Stubblefield said PERIOD

Students interested in the program will be required to submit an essay committing themselves to a lifestyle free of tobacco alcohol and drugs she said PERIOD

This will be the first year of the program Anderson said but it has found great success at other universities and there have been much higher application rates than expected on other campuses PERIOD

The program may need to be expanded she said possibly to its own residence hall PERIOD

Well look at it and assess from year to year Anderson said PERIOD

Firstyear student and Bailey Hall resident Jessica Schaefer said the new policy wouldnt change her decision to live in the residence halls next year but that it probably will change other peoples decisions about living in the residence halls PERIOD

I think people are just going to continue what theyre doing she said PERIOD If they were doing it before the new policy isnt going to stop them. room reapplication for current residents will begin Jan PERIOD  PERIOD More information will be distributed to students in the residence halls and via email PERIOD
