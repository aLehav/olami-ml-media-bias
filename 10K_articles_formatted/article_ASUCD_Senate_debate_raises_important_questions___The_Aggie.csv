Proposition  passed and Obama won the presidency but election season isnt over yet PERIOD Wednesday afternoon marked an exciting start to this weeks ASUCD Senate elections as candidates hashed it out over budget cuts the slate system financial aid and number of other studentcentered issues PERIOD

The debate was presented in three parts beginning with a panelisttocandidate questionandanswer period in which the three panelists  two from The California Aggie and one from ASUCDs Elections Committee  questioned the candidates stances on individual issues pertaining to their platform goals as well as what changes they hope to make as potential ASUCD senators PERIOD

One of the more controversial issues discussed was whether or not to disband ASUCDs recently constructed Outreach Assembly PERIOD According to the ASUCD website the assembly is responsible for helping bridge the disconnect between campus clubs and ASUCD student government by assigning  commissioners to attend club meetings and organize collaborative events between campus clubs and ASUCD leadership PERIOD

The assembly was criticized by several candidates including Greg Webb a junior political science and economics double major who called it an inefficient use of ASUCD resources and pointed out its high number of vacancies PERIOD Sophomore candidate Jack Zwald countered Webb and defended the program asserting that senators should instead look at where staff development money is going and look to see if thats a worthwhile cut. in the second portion of the debate panelists challenged the candidates knowledge of campus and city affairs by asking them to name three UC Davis vice chancellors  a question to which none raised their hands  and to name three Davis city council members  to which all of them responded PERIOD

The merits of a slate system  long a controversial aspect of ASUCD elections  sparked strong opinions on both sides of the table PERIOD The ASUCD system allows candidates to run under a slate akin to political parties which helps them by organizing the support of fellow party candidates PERIOD After the recent dissolution of the GO slate LEAD is now the only slate within the ASUCD system and currently holds a majority in the senate PERIOD

Those who oppose the slate system including independents Greg Webb and Justin Patrizio argue that the use of a slate system encourages bias and party politics and is unfair to students who dont agree with the party platform PERIOD Supporters of the slate system such as LEAD member and current senator Andrew Bianchi argue that it provides institutional memory by showing a proven record of leadership within the ASUCD system as members of the slate have been represented in senate since  when LEAD was first created PERIOD

After several pointed exchanges between candidates LEAD candidate Mo Torres helped diffuse the dispute PERIOD

It doesnt matter if youre LEAD or independent if youre on the senate you should keep the students interests in mind he said PERIOD I dont want the label of LEAD or independent to get in the way of making a positive impact in the lives of students. the final portion of the debate was a brief audience question and answer period where students submitted questions to specific candidates and were rewarded with an ASUCD elections Tshirt PERIOD

The official ASUCD General Election will take place from Nov PERIOD  to  PERIOD UC Davis undergraduate students can vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu PERIOD
