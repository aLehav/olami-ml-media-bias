9395,2020-10-21,"the problem with Wake Forest social life is not that it is too Greek but that it is not nonGreek enough PERIOD That is there are not strong enough alternatives to the predominantly Greek way of life at Wake Forest PERIOD This is a problem because many students feel compelled to join Greek life for no reason other than it presents an ostensiblyclear path to belonging on campus PERIOD There are other paths of course but they are undeniably and overwhelmingly overshadowed by the fraternities and sororities PERIOD We have long reached a point when one can justifiably ask What else is there to do on a Friday or Saturday night other than go out to a frat party



This is not only a regrettable state of affairs but an unhealthy and unbalanced one too PERIOD For one thing students should not have to feel like going Greek is the only way to go at Wake Forest PERIOD That is merely a fiction  an illusion allowed to hold sway in the glaring absence of a strong healthy nonGreek life PERIOD Students come to campus as freshmen and very early fall under the popular but misleading impression that the in or cool thing to do is to be a part of Greek life PERIOD Inevitably many students are hooked and take the bait offered by frat parties not necessarily because they are good or fun but because everyone seems to partake in them PERIOD Unchallenged by nonGreek life fraternities and sororities have an airtight monopoly over the social scene PERIOD It is no wonder that so many believe that if they want to fit in at Wake Forest they need to buy in to what the Greeks are selling PERIOD Again the problem is not the Greeks but that students feel obliged to join them out of a perceived social necessity PERIOD

Obviously Greek life is not the only road to belonging at Wake Forest PERIOD Plenty of students including Greeks themselves find their sense of belonging in nonGreek organizations  sports teams faith and identity groups campus leadership and so on PERIOD I myself have found much of my belonging in Student Government and the Resident Student Association PERIOD The former is a prime example of how the Greek versus nonGreek dynamic is skewed against the nonGreeks PERIOD There has not been a nonGreek president of Student Government in something like a decade PERIOD In recent years Greek candidates have been so favored that the outcome of elections has become virtually a foregone conclusion PERIOD Ours is no fair or democratic process PERIOD The Greeks due to their superior cohesion vote as a bloc and Greek candidates need but activate their base to win every year PERIOD The question is not who best appeals to the students but who best appeals to the fraternities and sororities so naturally Greek candidates have the ultimate advantage year by year PERIOD

The nonGreeks then need to grow powerful enough to rival the Greeks PERIOD They need to cultivate a united sense of solidarity and show students what their options are beyond faux Hellenistic insignia PERIOD Without strong nonGreek alternatives the Greeks will continue to reign supreme and students will continue to think that their way is the only way of finding ones place PERIOD Again we all know and recognize there are other ways but they seemingly do not provide the same kind of clear and solid foundation for relationships and networking PERIOD

To that end I think that nonGreek leaders and communities should band together in the same way that the Greeks do PERIOD I think nonGreeks need to find new attractive ways to sell nonGreek life PERIOD For me this starts with putting on display everything else there is to do on campus and reassuring everyone who does not fit the Greek mold that they can find their place elsewhere PERIOD NonGreek life and alternatives need to be prominently and vigorously promoted and nonGreeks need to be actively recruited PERIOD Once this picks up speed I am hopeful that one day nonGreeks will throw their own parties and stress diversity and inclusion in opposition to homogeneity and exclusion PERIOD I am hopeful that one day students will be just as proud to call themselves nonGreeks as much as Greeks PERIOD

The Romans were better anyway PERIOD

Maybe a lot of people are not interested in fraternity parties juvenile initiations mickey mouse student government offices or the need to be part of the in crowd PERIOD  Maybe they dont feel there is a good return on the investment of dues PERIOD  Arent there plenty of places to have a date besides fraternity parties
