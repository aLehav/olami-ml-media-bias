Oelschlegel told us how the number of females helping out with the Katrina reconstruction efforts is much greater than the number of males PERIOD From this his personal observation he draws the conclusion that the reason for the lack of men in the rebuilding efforts is that men are behaving like women now PERIOD  The flaw in Oelschlegels logic is obvious even without putting it into syllogistic form PERIOD As a matter of fact there is no valid form for his argument hes using two particular premises some women helped out some men did not help out to support a universal conclusion all men are acting like women and you cant there from here PERIOD Hes saying men are acting like women because theyre not doing what women are doing PERIOD What the hell is this  Oelschlegel claims the problem is that society teaches men to be nice feminized guys. if this were true then there would be more men doing the nice empirically feminine thing and helping out PERIOD Of course its not true not by a long shot PERIOD  Most boys still get taught to be selfish to yield to their impulses and not think of others PERIOD That is why they are usually the ones who disrupt classes and have higher dropout rates PERIOD  There was much less tolerance for conduct problems in all students in the 1950s and 60s yet kids came out of high school getting better scores on the SATs PERIOD Also nearly everyone thinks more clearly after rigorous physical activity PERIOD  This notion that girls like to sit still and quiet for hours on end is only around in this day and age due to Christina HoffSummers sublimating her masochistic tendencies in books that ought to have conveniently perforated pages PERIOD As for the issue of cognitive sex differences there is still no way to control for socialization and that means all the expensive MRI studies aimed at showing biologically predetermined differences in cognitive abilities are ultimately equivocal PERIOD  There is no war on boys PERIOD If there was then calling someone the man wouldnt be a compliment  but it is  and likening someone to a girl or a woman wouldnt be an insult  but it is PERIOD Just look at what Oelschlegel did PERIOD He was disappointed by his sexs lack of charity and diminished scholastic standings so he claimed that all these unmotivated men had been turned into women even though all the women around him were behaving in a highly motivated manner PERIOD  Oelschlegel is a product of a sexist society and hes so intent on labeling whats associated with women as bad less or weak and reserving all that is good for manliness that he doesnt seem to notice or care that hes contradicting himself PERIOD Contradictions usually result from rhetorical Uturns and thats definitely the case here PERIOD The hidden supposition steering Oelschlegels rhetoric is this if anyone dares to challenge notions about boys getting to be selfish loud inconsiderate and just generally not expected to develop the same selfrestraint as girls then boys will sulk do nothing and grow up to be apathetic dullards PERIOD Deep down inside everyone wants to be selfish aggressive and inconsiderate PERIOD Getting a grip on those urges is called growing up  not feminization. oelschlegels implied message that boys will spend their lives sucking their thumbs if they dont get their way all the time might be true PERIOD I myself have seen evidence of it PERIOD However assuming that all men will act like babies please note the gender neutrality here based on particular instances of this being so wouldnt be right PERIOD It would shortchange the men who have done the work that we all must do to be competent mature adults PERIOD  It would crush my own hopes for equity between the sexes and it would be the employment of flawed logic PERIOD You cant get to universal conclusions from particular premises but you can get to a particular conclusion from a universal premise PERIOD  Amelia Sabadini An Amherst College student
