Early Monday afternoon the Washtenaw County Prosecutors Office under recently swornin Prosecutor Eli Savit unveiled its latest policy intended to combat racial profiling in policing PERIOD

The new policy prevents the prosecutors office from filing charges based on pretext stops  stops in which officers detain individuals on the basis of an observed traffic violation PERIOD In reality these stops are made in order to search an individual for drugs or other contraband PERIOD The policy cites local and national data indicating these pretext stops disproportionately target people of color PERIOD

Pretext stops are  inextricably intertwined with racial profiling the policy directive reads PERIOD And that leads to racial inequity in our broader criminal justice system PERIOD Pretext stops are humiliating traumatizing and can lead to broad distrust of law enforcement in communities of color. the policy notes that other states like New Mexico and Washington have similar policies prohibiting pretext stops which have not demonstrated correlated increases in criminal activity PERIOD

The policy does not apply to stops where officers are investigating and have probable cause leading to the discovery of contraband such as illegal substances PERIOD

The new policy comes just three weeks after Savit took office on Jan PERIOD  following two weeks of sweeping progressive changes PERIOD Savit has announced other policies aimed at combating racial inequities in the criminal justice system such as eliminating cash bail and stopping the prosecution of individuals found with marijuana and naturally occurring psychedelics PERIOD

Todays policy directive is about rebuilding trust in our community Savit said in the Monday press release PERIOD We are sending a message that we are not interested in pursuing contraband charges that stem from racial profiling. these policies confront a history of racial profiling and strained policecivilian relations in Ann Arbor PERIOD In  an Ann Arbor police officer shot and killed Aura Rosser a 40yearold Black woman who was at her boyfriends home at the time PERIOD Former Washtenaw County Prosecutor Brian Mackie  who held the position for decades  determined the officer was acting in selfdefense and did not charge him PERIOD

Mackies decision was met with criticism from the community PERIOD In recent years Ann Arbor residents have protested against racial profiling from Ann Arbor Police Department PERIOD

This past summer the relationship between police and Washtenaw County residents was once again tested when a video emerged of a Washtenaw County sheriffs deputy punching a Black woman in the head during an arrest PERIOD In September Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel determined that the deputys use of force was justified despite many protests from Washtenaw County community members PERIOD

The new policy ending pretext stops was announced on Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD Day and cites Kings legacy as inspiration PERIOD Savits Chief Assistant Victoria BurtonHarris referenced King in Mondays press release PERIOD

Dr PERIOD King believed that the time is always right to do what is right BurtonHarris said PERIOD Pretextual stops  stemming from implicit biases or not  erode community trust and make us less safe  Our Policy Regarding Pretext Stops is another proactive step towards creating a criminal justice system that works for all of us. daily Staff Reporter Julianna Morano can be reached at jucomoraumich.edu PERIOD
