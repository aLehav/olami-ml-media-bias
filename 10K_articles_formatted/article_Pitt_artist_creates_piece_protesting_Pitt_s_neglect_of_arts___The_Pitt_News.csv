The The hallways of the studio arts department are scarred with use PERIOD An exit light flickers PERIOD

The neglect of the studio arts department and the plight of Pitt in general are the subject of Emily Boninas Fourteen Points of Light installation of nonflickering light bulbs PERIOD

The installation consists of  bare light bulbs strung across the terrace on the right side of the Frick Fine Arts Building PERIOD

The multimedia piece installed on the grounds of the Frick building and in place Tuesday from  a.m PERIOD until  p.m. is Bonina said her attempt to bring light to the situation facing Pitt PERIOD

I got the idea to do this because a friend and I have been thinking a lot about the increases in tuition and Nordenbergs salary lately PERIOD The number  kept popping into my head said Bonina PERIOD Then I noticed that there were  spaces on this structure. each of the light bulbs hangs in one of the  spaces on the concrete structure PERIOD

In a department with  people enrolled as majors Bonina said the department is grossly neglected. last year our big purchase was a paper cutter Bonina said PERIOD

In her artistic statement Bonina said that the studio arts department is ignored because it does not generate big revenue for the University PERIOD

Pitt Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs Robert Hill could not be reached for comment after hours PERIOD

The original plan for the installation allowed viewers to interact with the piece by posting thoughts feelings andor suggestions but Bonina said the wind was too much. she said she did however get an email accusing her of crucifying the chancellor. bonina said that she was not attacking the chancellor but simply trying to draw attention to the situation. join our newsletter
