8429,2023-11-05,"the Facebook groups have been created the editorials have been written student leaders have spoken and activism has returned to the College of William and Mary PERIOD The cause Access to our new business school for latenight studying PERIOD What has activism come to How did we become so petty and mundane

Well actually college students have always been this way PERIOD After the radicalism of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rightsera showed students the benefit of cutting classes to stand up for their beliefs it wasnt long before we applied this principle to issues closer to home PERIOD In  Harvard University Dean John B PERIOD Fox had the audacity to dictate that two dining halls would not serve hot breakfasts PERIOD Students quickly rallied behind a group ominously christened the Eggshell Alliance PERIOD

The Harvard Crimson reported On a warm morning in the spring of  the Eggshell Alliance mustered just after  a.m PERIOD at the Mather and Dunster House dining halls PERIOD Chanting we want it hot about  demonstrators blew whistles and clashed cymbals as they marched toward University Hall and the old Union dining hall in protest of the decision. of course Harvard students werent so insular as to think that food was the only important issue of the day PERIOD They also protested rising tuition and the ringing of Memorial Churchs morning bells as they were apt to disturb students muchneeded sleep PERIOD

This isnt to say that concerns outside the walls of universities were not given their fair share of thought PERIOD The 80s saw an upsurge in activism directed at South African apartheid PERIOD Students held candlelight vigils and demanded their schools give up South African holdings and as we all know this soon terrified South Africa into compliance PERIOD

But this victory left students without any similarly highprofile cause PERIOD There were no overarching issues to unite students everywhere so students of today are very different in their protesting tastes PERIOD Social and political issues still hold some allure PERIOD Prolife antiwar and gay rights demonstrations are not uncommon on campuses however they seem to lack the vigor and novelty of years past PERIOD What really gets students riled up are the collegespecific issues that affect students daily PERIOD

At Gallaudet University a school for the deaf in Washington D.C. anarchy broke out after a new school president was appointed PERIOD For issues I will not even pretend to understand the new president was not wellreceived by the student body which responded by shutting down the school PERIOD
The Washington Post vividly paints the scene As messages spread from pager to pager overnight the crowd grew from dozens to hundreds of students early yesterday PERIOD Scores of burly football players stood in lines with their shoulders thrown back defiantly glowering and blocking the main entrance PERIOD With a drum pounding in the background students surged around the few cars that tried to get in to the campus which includes elementary and secondary schools for deaf students arguing in sign language with angry drivers. of course this is the exception rather than the rule  most student activism is more lowkey and about even less important issues PERIOD For example  students attending University of Colorado at Colorado Springs protested the fact that a college health fair did not tell students that marijuana was better for you than alcohol PERIOD Or my personal favorite students at many colleges across the county are now wearing empty gunholsters to class to protest colleges restricting concealed weapons on campuses PERIOD

So dont worry College students you are carrying on the proud traditions of railing against issues that are of limited importance PERIOD At the end of the day maybe its not so pointless PERIOD After all small changes can make college life more comfortable and activism is a proven way to get things done PERIOD But dont get me wrong  concerning the Alan B PERIOD Miller Hall situation I couldnt care less PERIOD
