Catherine Gabel a sophomore in the College of Communication and president of the organization said she initiated the Style Club at Marquette because of the abundance of fashionfocused individuals she has noticed around campus PERIOD

I have always loved fashion Gabel said PERIOD I wanted to bring people together with the same interests and have a fashion activity to participate in. gabel added that fashionable people are all over Marquette and the start of this organization may help unify such related and strong interests PERIOD

Gabel said she was overwhelmed by Marquette students enthusiasm toward the fashioncentered organization PERIOD

I had around  people sign up at OFest and at least  by email Gabel said PERIOD I really think this is a club our campus needed as a creative outlet. sterling Hardaway a junior in the College of Arts  Sciences and formerstudent organizations committeechair in Marquette Student Government said last years approval acceptance rate for potential clubs was very high PERIOD

In the two semesters I was chair not one organization was denied Hardaway said PERIOD We try to approve every club that is inclusive and adheres to the values of Marquette. hardaway added that the approval process for new organizations is somewhat lengthy as they must file a form with the Office of Student Development then draft a contract outlining their goals and initiatives before finally presenting their work to MUSG for final debate PERIOD

While Hardaway is unsure of the student organizations approved thus far this year organizations like the Style Club were often approved quickly as they presented information in line with MUSGs guidelines PERIOD

The Style Club will primarily focus on maintaining an online blog and magazine featuring fashion beauty and interior design advice PERIOD There are no fees to join the club PERIOD

According to Gabel the club will meet bimonthly to discuss the blogs progress PERIOD She said sheplans to expose her members to important individuals in the fashion industryand toplan future events for the club PERIOD

We want to go to Chicago to visit a few fashion events and stores Gabel said PERIOD

Gabel added that suchaforementionedplansmade establishing her organization feasible and Matthew Lengen the Coordinator for Student Organizations was also immediately on board PERIOD

He helped us get approved and into OFest on very short notice Gabel said PERIOD

Marlo Marisie a sophomore in the College of Communication said Marquettes city campus is an appropriate location for the Style Club PERIOD

I love that a ton of students on Marquettes campus dress very fashionably on a daily basis rather than wearing grungy sweats like you would see on many other campuses Marisie said PERIOD

She added that the Style Club will provide a new creative outlet for fashionforward students PERIOD

As former fashion reporter of Marquette U Television I have a true passion for fashion style and trends Marisie said PERIOD Im a big fashion blog reader and thought it would be fun to be a part of the Style Clubs fashion outlet for our campus. marisie said that many students at Marquette have a unique and trendy style and in turn will form a solid organization PERIOD

In order to properly establish the Style Clubs presence at Marquette Gabel said social media will be her biggest tool in sharing organizational updates and events PERIOD
