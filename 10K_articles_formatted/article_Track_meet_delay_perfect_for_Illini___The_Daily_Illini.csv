The decision to move the Illinois Invitational from Saturday to Sunday worked out in favor of the Illinois womens track and field team PERIOD The sun shined throughout the day at the Illinois Track and Soccer Complex providing favorable weather for the meet PERIOD

I think that it was a smart decision to move the meet head coach Gary Winckler said PERIOD We had a pretty good day today we had a lot of people set some personal bests PERIOD We ran some really nice sprint times the 1500meter times were good Katie Engel did a great job PERIOD It was good for us especially after last week PERIOD We had one meet cancelled and the other one basically cancelled so it was nice to get out there finally. engel took the 1500meter run with a time of . while fellow Illini Angela Bizzarri placed third . pERIOD Bizzarri placed second in the 800meter run with a time of . pERIOD
