Its always good to open their eyes and show them what college basketball really is about Spangler said PERIOD

Wednesday well have some up and downs but I think it will just show us what we need to get better on. when it comes to tough environments success often depends on how tight the offense is from possession to possession PERIOD This is where sophomore Jordan Woodard comes in PERIOD

As the Sooners floor general at point guard it will be Woodards job to control the tempo and keep his teammates calm when the fans get loud PERIOD

Turnovers are going to lead to fast breaks and thats really what gets the crowd into it  when they see their players moving up and down Woodard said PERIOD

We just have to make sure were making shots and not turning the ball over and well be fine. the Bluejays are off to a solid start this year trying to follow up a  season that was one of the best in the history of the program PERIOD They went  on the year and  in their first season as members of the Big East good for second in the conference PERIOD How far Creighton goes this year however will depend on how they replace Doug McDermott  last seasons National Player of the Year PERIOD
