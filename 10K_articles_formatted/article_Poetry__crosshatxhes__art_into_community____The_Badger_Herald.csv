In a city as large and involved in the arts as Madison it is not all that surprising to find a thriving poetry community PERIOD It is surprising however to find a poetry reading series that incorporates elements from every poetry reading this city has to offer PERIOD

This is where the Crosshatxh Poetry Series comes in PERIOD

Curated by Laurel Bastian the current Halls Emerging Artist Fellow at the WI Institute for Creative Writing the Crosshatxh Poetry Series crosses the line between academia and community  creating performances that can range from sonnet material to spoken word and everything in between PERIOD Crosshatxh devotes itself to finding new writers as well as those immersed in their community and gives voice not only to poets who are familiar to Madisons scene but also those who have never performed before PERIOD

Bastian recently sat down with The Badger Herald to talk about her current project PERIOD Full of energetic hand gestures an intent gaze and a voice full of animation to say Bastian is passionate about the Crosshatxh Series is an understatement PERIOD

Starting out in Milwaukee as a slam poet and eventually owning her own venue Bastian is no stranger to the poetry scene on either side of the stage PERIOD While attending several readings throughout the Madison community one thing in particular stood out to her How fractured and in their own world each performance was PERIOD

I thought Thats what Im hungry for Bastian said Im hungry for going to a show where theres at least two people Ive never heard before and where theres going to be something for everybodyThat was how I started conceiving the project. crossover is just the beginning of where this series differs however PERIOD In addition to being able to boast shows that incorporate aspects from all subgenres of poetry performance Crosshatxh brings dead poets back to life every couple of months PERIOD Last semester Emily Dickinson graced the stage and last nights performance at Avols Bookstore featured the deceased Anne Sexton PERIOD

Were always influenced deeply by those who came before us PERIOD We dont always have access to the spark of life belonging to that one original voice but when somebody is embodying the poet it allows us to access their work in that way PERIOD So its just like a fun reorientation to these folks who have been really important in our art Bastian said PERIOD

Crosshatxhs break from the traditional is further intensified by the second dynamic Bastian stated as different from other series PERIOD Active in the community Bastian is the foundercoordinator of the Writers in Prisons project and teaches a weekly poetryspoken word class at the mens prison in Oregon Wis PERIOD

When youre in academia you want to be able to have an impact on folks who arent necessarily inside of an institution or are in a different kind of institution Bastian said So it felt like my work there was in some ways more real than my work with students here as many of the men have been in there longer than Ive been alive. bastians involvement with the prison transcends prison walls as students of hers are all welcome to perform at readings upon release and removal from parole PERIOD

Some of the most skilled writers that Ive heard are these guys behind bars and it would be really nice for them to be rewelcomed into their community or seen in a different way than they have in the past  or  years Bastian said PERIOD

All proceeds from the performances benefit the Wisconsin Books to Prisoners project which sends books to prisoners in the state free of charge PERIOD So far Crosshatxh has raised almost  for the program PERIOD

While the next Crosshatxh Poetry Series reading is not until March  Bastian will continue to be busy generating even more unique performances and audiences willing to give Crosshatxh a listen PERIOD

The one thing thats been most exciting to me  besides listening to great readers  over the past six months has been the audience shift PERIOD In the beginning the audience was whoever I could heckle from my friends and colleagues to come Bastian said PERIOD I get really excited when people come who Ive never seen before and who dont know any of the readers. the Crosshatxh Poetry Series performs monthly at Avols Bookstore at  Gorham St PERIOD Performances are free though donations are welcome PERIOD More information can be found at Crosshatxhs blog httpcrosshatxh.blogspot.com PERIOD
