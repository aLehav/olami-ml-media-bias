The Massachusetts womens basketball team earned its third straight victory with a  win on Sunday at Mullins Center against Merrimack thanks to a strong second half where UMass outscored the Warriors by  PERIOD

The Minutewomen  jumped out to a  lead after the first quarter but a rough second quarter where UMass converted just two out of  shots from the field kept Merrimack  in the game before a halftime speech from coach Tory Verdi helped lead the Minutewomen to a dominant second half performance PERIOD

We had a rough start freshman Hailey Leidel said PERIOD We were a little rattled and we werent really playing like ourselves but at halftime coach really refocused us and we had a great third quarter and I think that really pulled us together and what made our win seem so great. pERIOD

Leidel led the Minutewomen with  points in the win over the Warriors going 9for12 from the field including 4for6 from beyond the arc PERIOD

Leidel now leads the Minutewomen with  points per game and earned the Atlantic  rookie of the week award on Monday for the second time already this season PERIOD

I think its special PERIOD Its good news to hear because weve been putting so much work in everyone has so much faith in me here PERIOD Im happy I can produce on the court and get an honor like that for the school PERIOD I think its great Leidel said PERIOD

Verdi has been pleased with what hes seen from the young guard to start the season PERIOD

Hailey is a freshman with a lot of confidence PERIOD She obviously has a tremendous skillset PERIOD Doing what shes doing right now for us its quite an accomplishment Verdi said PERIOD

UMass added double doubles from sophomore Jessica George the first of her career and junior Maggie Mulligan her fifth straight game with a doubledouble leading the A10 PERIOD

Its not really a focus of mine Mulligan said about securing so many doubledoubles PERIOD I think that just the privilege of being able to play  minutes every game Im able to do that and I feel like I need to score a lot because we have such limited numbers of players. the Minutewomens five starters in the game against the Merrimack Mulligan Leidel George Leah McDerment and Ryan Holder all tallied at least  minutes as UMass still finds itself short on players due to injuries PERIOD

Verdi said after practice on Monday that hes hopeful senior Alyx Stiff and redshirtjunior Alyssa Lawrence will be able to return to game action next week which would provide UMass with some muchneeded depth PERIOD

The 29point victory over the Warriors comes on the heels of a 39point win against Central Connecticut State in the previous game PERIOD For a team that has battled so much adversity early in the season with a number of injuries these big wins give the Minutewomen a nice confidence boost PERIOD

I just think it gives us a little bit of confidence knowing that we can put five players on the floor and we can do something special PERIOD Understanding that regardless of our limited roster we can still go out there and win basketball games Verdi said PERIOD

The Minutewomen will be back in action again on Wednesday when they go on the road to take on Hartford a team that UMass beat last season but needed a 26point comeback to do so PERIOD

Hopefully we dont have to have such a stressful game but I think it will be good Mulligan said PERIOD
