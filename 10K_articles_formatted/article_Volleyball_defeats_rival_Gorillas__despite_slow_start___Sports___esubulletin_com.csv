The Lady Hornets faced off against the Pittsburgh State Gorillas last Friday at the William Allen White Auditorium downtown PERIOD After a slow start the Hornets fought to defeat the Gorillas  PERIOD

Starting off the Hornets were down  before scoring their first point PERIOD They never did grab momentum in the first set and nothing seemed to go Emporias way as they took their first and only loss  PERIOD

I could tell during warm ups that we were not mentally prepared said Bing Xu head coach PERIOD

But the Hornets looked like a whole new team to start the second set hustling to fight back PERIOD Freshman middle blocker Courtney Haring put up some big blocks to discourage the Pittsburg hitters adding six on the night while sophomore Brianna Kaiser attacked the nets viciously PERIOD Emporia took the second set  off of a kill by sophomore right side hitter Morgan Buckner PERIOD

It was a little rocky in the beginning but we knew we had to pick it up Kaiser said PERIOD We all had to be there for each other. with the match tied both teams came out pumped to start the third set PERIOD Kaiser and Buckner continued to add kills as freshman outside hitter Carly Spicer contributed her part as well finishing the night with eight kills and one block PERIOD

The crowd erupted as Spicer hit two kills in a row to make the score  forcing the Gorillas to call a timeout PERIOD When Pittsburg took the lead at  Xu called a timeout to reassure his team that they could beat the Gorillas PERIOD

Freshman setter Katie Deutschmann assisted many of the points as she added some kills of her own PERIOD Just when the Gorillas looked to have the third set within reach the Hornets responded with three straight points winning the set  PERIOD

We really had to pick up our game in the third set Spicer said PERIOD Amanda and Katie were setting really good sets PERIOD It was a team effort. both teams looked evenly matched at the start of the fourth set PERIOD Buckner and Kaiser hit the nets ferociously PERIOD Deutschmann who led the Hornets with  kills  assists and three blocks was not shy as she continuously spiked the ball and tore apart the Gorillas back row PERIOD The Hornets took the fourth set with a score of  PERIOD winning the match  PERIOD

They learned their lesson from the first set and showed a lot of character Xu said PERIOD

The Hornets will host the Fort Hays State Tigers at  p.m PERIOD tomorrow at White Auditorium PERIOD
