There has been an overwhelming amount of media regarding COVID19 PERIOD People are panicking about what our future will hold PERIOD Having to experience this daily can create a significant amount of anxieties PERIOD However mental health has not been a topic of much conversation during this pandemic much less the mental health of college students PERIOD

Students are being forced to move home since all inperson courses have been suspended PERIOD Some students are forced to move back into abusive households others do not have internet access at home that is needed to access their courses PERIOD Some students live in small apartments with family and do not have the space to focus on their courses without distractions PERIOD Some are responsible for working to provide for their entire family which may interfere with their courses PERIOD

Students that once had access to mental health services on their college campuses are no longer able to access them PERIOD Although there are providers that are offering virtual therapy many students are still not able to access them due to time constraints or a lack of finances PERIOD Some students may not even be aware that these virtual services are offered since they are not sufficiently advertised PERIOD

It is essential to pay more attention to the mental health needs of not only college students but our entire country PERIOD We need new policies that will take mental health into consideration as we endure through COVID19 PERIOD We are all going through this situation together and we all need to be supportive of mental wellness PERIOD

Melanie is pursuing a masters degree in social work PERIOD
