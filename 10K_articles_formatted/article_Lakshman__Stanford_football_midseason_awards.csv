5320,2015-10-07,"with the bye week finally upon us and five games of the regular season under our belts we can finally take a moment to step back and reflect on the undulating ride that is Stanford Football PERIOD With the breakneck drinkingthroughafirehose pace of football set to pick up very soon with UCLA coming to town next Thursday lets take a moment to highlight the superlatives from the first half of the season PERIOD

Disclaimer The following completely immaterial and inconsequential awards are entirely derived from my own thoughts and do not reflect the views of The Daily in any way PERIOD Though if the Daily were to sponsor these awards I would welcome the idea PERIOD You have my contact info. most Valuable Player  Offense

Christian McCaffrey In a rare moment of tipping its hand the Stanford coaching staff gushed about McCaffreys progression throughout the offseason and made no secret about itsdesire to feed the sophomore running backreturnersuperhuman as much as possible PERIOD

The results have arguably been even better than expected McCaffrey currently leads the nation in all purpose yards and holds a  yard lead on presumptive Heisman frontrunner Leonard Fournette PERIOD Against Oregon State he also became the first Stanford player since Toby Gerhart in  to rush for over  yards and became the first Cardinal back to carry the ball  times in over a year PERIOD

While identifying a single offensive player amongst an entire unit playing as well as anybody in the country flies in the face of the ultimate team sport that is football its hard to ignore McCaffreys place as a national leader statistically and his ability to line up all over the field a major asset for the mad scientists of exotic formations that are David Shaw and Mike Bloomgren PERIOD

If theres any possible way to critique McCaffrey it might be that hes only found the endzone twice this season and its hard not to think that if a few of those Remound Wright vulture touchdowns went under No PERIOD 5s name he would be a toptier Heisman contender PERIOD

Honorable Mentions

Kevin Hogan  Against Arizona Hogan posted just as many touchdown passes two as incompletions and has connected on a ludicrous . percent of his throws over the past three games PERIOD Enough said PERIOD

Josh Garnett  Garnett rarely gets the recognition he deserves for Stanfords recent offensive explosion but the accolades are starting to come his way as he earned Offensive MVP honors after the Cardinals  destruction of Arizona PERIOD At  pounds but blessed with the nimble feet of a much smaller human being Garnett was born to obliterate defenders as a pulling guard on run plays and the results have made an appreciable difference for the Cardinal PERIOD

Defensive MVP

Blake Martinez Choosing anybody else for this award would be a bigger snub than Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan at the Oscars PERIOD Thats no slight at the other Stanford defenders but Martinez has been quite literally everywhere for a shorthanded Stanford front PERIOD As with McCaffrey the numbers simply speak for themselves PERIOD

Martinez currently leads the nation with . tackles per game and is on pace for over  stops which would be  more than Shayne Skov accumulated in his best season PERIOD Its hard to picture the Cardinal defense being remotely as successful without Martinez flying across the field PERIOD

Honorable Mention

Ronnie Harris  Despite a fair share of questions surrounding his ability to cover big physical receivers as Stanfords No PERIOD  corner guilty as charged the 5foot10  pound Harris has impressed in his new role PERIOD After beginning his career as a nickelback and special teams shark Harris has evolved into a lockdown defender and a vocal leader in the locker room PERIOD

Newcomer of the Year

Brennan Scarlett  In his short time on The Farm Scarlett is the owner of a number of distinctions including the designation of being the programs first graduate transfer from Cal of all places PERIOD Simply put the fifthyear senior has been an absolute godsend for the Cardinal PERIOD Before Harrison Phillips seasonending injury Scarletts arrival was seen as a major boost to a perilously thin Stanford defensive line but his presence has now become a vital necessity since Phillips went down PERIOD Through the first half of this season he has racked up more tackles  than he did all of last year in an injuryshortened campaign for the Bears PERIOD

Honorable Mention

Bryce Love Its no coincidence that Stanfords recent offensive explosion culminating in three straight games of over  points coincided with the true freshman Loves emergence as a dangerous speedster in the UCF game PERIOD While Love has yet to match his tworeception  yard performance against the Knights his presence on the field is one defenses have to respect and his savviness as the motionman in Wildcat packages has slowly shifted the attitude of Stanford fans towards the formation from outright disdain to excitement PERIOD

Play of the Season

The FleaFlicker Its hard to pin down an entire narrative on a single play but we just might look back at Stanfords first offensive touchdown of the  season as the catalyst that ignited something special PERIOD After an ugly opening  minutes against Central Florida the offensive inefficiency and penalties that had doomed Stanford in  looked ready to haunt the team through another ugly season PERIOD But in a single snap Stanford not only found the endzone for the first time but also exorcised those demons of inconsistency PERIOD This play just might go down in Stanford lore as the spark that ignited a fire PERIOD

Honorable Mention

Keller Chrysts Pancake Block vs PERIOD Arizona The words quarterback and pancake block were never supposed to occupy the same real estate in the English language but Stanford and backup quarterback Keller Chryst defied all convention with the designed play against the Wildcats PERIOD A healthy Kevin Hogan exited the field to give way to Chryst who pitched the ball to McCaffrey before immediately charging as the leadblocker and quite literally putting Arizona defender Cam Denson on his back PERIOD It was a play as shocking and unexpected as it was flawlessly executed PERIOD Shaws decision to replace his starting quarterback with a battering ram wearing a helmet in the midst of the game flow merits plenty of points in the ingenuity department PERIOD

Best Twitter Follow

Aziz Shittu And now its finally time for the most coveted of the midseason awards PERIOD Theres no shortage of wordsmiths on this Stanford football roster but defensive lineman Aziz Shittu has to take home the trophy for the best Twitter follow PERIOD Always one for inspirational motivational quotes and random musings on life shiTrue is as entertaining of a Twitter persona as they come PERIOD And with the added time of the bye week Shittus Twitter game has been extra strong PERIOD

Announcing my official retirement from 2K due to inferior competition on campus PERIOD
