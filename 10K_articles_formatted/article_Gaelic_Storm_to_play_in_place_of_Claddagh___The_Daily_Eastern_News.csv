After an abrupt cancellation popular Irish band Gaelic Storm will be performing in replace of Celtic dance group Claddagh PERIOD



Dan Crews the director of patron services of the Doudna Fine Arts Center said Claddagh is a new group that has never toured before and is working out problems with their show PERIOD

Crews said they found out about Claddagh from on of the agents the Doudna works with to book acts PERIOD

They talked about this new show being put together in Ireland Crews said PERIOD It is kind of a celebration of Irish music and dance. crews said the directors caught their attention because they worked on other Irish tours like Celtic Nights and Rhythm of the Dance. crews said the show was supposed to be ready by early September and they made it fit into the production schedule PERIOD

We liked the idea that we would be one of the first to present it when it was coming out Crews said PERIOD

In July the producer called and said the show would not be ready in time but did not specify the reason behind the delay PERIOD

Crews said the crew in Doudna wanted to have a show that was similar and could be around the same time PERIOD

Crews said they heard that Gaelic Storm would be in the area around the same time PERIOD

They are doing us a great favor by coming and doing the show on the same day at the same time Crews said PERIOD

Crews said the group is a popular Irish band that was most notably featured in the movie Titanic. the band played in the scene where Rose was introduced to the underclass society through a party on a lower deck PERIOD

The group will be performing for the same price as Claddagh and the tickets will not cost extra PERIOD

Those who have already bought their tickets for Claddagh can either return their tickets for a refund or attend the Gaelic Storm performance PERIOD

Tickets will cost  and the performance will take place at  p.m PERIOD Sept PERIOD  in the Dvorak Concert Hall PERIOD

It was one of those things where you thank your lucky stars Crews said PERIOD
