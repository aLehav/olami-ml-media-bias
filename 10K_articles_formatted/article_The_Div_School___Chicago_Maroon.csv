2232,2022-03-16,"amid the literal firestorm that accompanied Milo Yiannopouloss canceled Berkeley visit campuses all over the country have erupted in defiant protest against the normalization of bigotry PERIOD Yiannopoulos a selfstyled free speech fundamentalist and his acolytes have gleefully looked to Berkeley and other incidents over controversial speakers at universities as examples of angry coddled college students unwilling to listen to other viewpointsa common conservative narrative PERIOD But while controversial campus speakers have largely dominated media coverage of free speech issues in the Trump era the Presidents current cabinet points to an overshadowed aspect of the First Amendment that conservatives seem less willing to defend the separation of church and state PERIOD

Even beyond the role of religion in government Trumps cabinet is already packed with unqualified politicians boasting embarrassingly meager rsums when compared to their counterparts in previous administrations PERIOD Take Secretary of Energy nominee Rick Perry PERIOD The former Texas governor who attended Texas AM University graduated with a transcript riddled with Cs including a D in a class called Meats. one of his predecessors won the Nobel Prize for Physics the other was a professor at MIT PERIOD

But perhaps the most glaring publicized example is Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos the scion of a Republican megadonor family with little previous background in education PERIOD Her close confirmation which passed by one vote endured extensive scrutiny of her family background PERIOD DeVos however has claimed to be a longstanding proponent of education reform in fairness as far back as  DeVos outlined her vision of using the American school system to advance Gods Kingdom. to the DeVos family the church has been displaced by the public school as the center for activity and as Dick DeVos notes it is certainly our hope that more and more churches will get more and more active and engaged in education. the main way they are trying to do this is through gutting the public school system and instead privatizing the industry with taxpayer funded charter schools and voucher programs PERIOD

While it is easy to dismiss the push toward charter schools as a billionaire pet project the fact remains that charter schools do not perform significantly better than public schools PERIOD Stephen Henderson a reporter with the Free Press in Michigan who has followed the DeVoss education experiments points to the abundance of failed charter schools in the Great Lake State which leads the nation in forprofit schools PERIOD DeVos harps on private and charter schools not because she thinks that this new system will lead to bettereducated students but because she wants to redirect taxpayer money from the public school system to specifically Christian charter schools PERIOD Trump already plans to dedicate  billion in federal money away from public schools and toward charter private or clearly religious schools PERIOD

The combination of increased privatization and vouchers for Christian schools from a billionaire intent on advancing Gods Kingdom is clearly worrisome PERIOD If DeVoss plans succeed then students will have no choice but to attend private religious schools because there are no viable public alternatives PERIOD This is a clear violation of the First Amendment PERIOD As Trump proposes building a border wall the constitutional wall dividing church and state is at risk of demolition PERIOD Even if DeVoss confirmation tanked there was an inevitability that any alternate pick would have belonged to the religious farright PERIOD After all Trump appointed Jerry Falwell Jr.the president of the worlds largest Christian university which teaches creationism under its biology departmentto spearhead an education task force for higher learning PERIOD Those in the public school system then are not the only ones who should worry PERIOD

Yet Trumps worrying refusal to commit to the separation of church from state is not only evident in his education reform PERIOD Trump acknowledging his ardent base of evangelical supporters pledged to repeal the admittedly oftunenforced Johnson Amendment which prohibits taxexempt institutions such as churches from endorsing candidates PERIOD In another nod to Christian conservatives a leaked draft proposal from the White House advanced religious freedom considerations based on moral objectionsa euphemistic way to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals among others PERIOD Combine this with the thinlyveiled Islamophobia of Trumps immigration ban and Steve Bannons sinister vision of a JudeoChristian capitalist West wrangling with the Islamic Eastin itself an extremely medieval viewpoint in an increasingly medieval administrationand its clear that Trumps supporters in picking and nitpicking only certain elements of free speech to uphold are not the First Amendment defenders they make themselves out to be PERIOD
