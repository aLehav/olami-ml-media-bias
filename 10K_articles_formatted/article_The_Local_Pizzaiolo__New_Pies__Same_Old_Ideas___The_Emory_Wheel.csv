The Emory population is spoiled for choice when it comes to pizza places PERIOD Blaze Pizza on North Decatur Road offers affordable madetoorder pizzas within walking distance PERIOD Antico Pizza is a justifiably more upscale awardwinning pizzeria that happens to be nearby and  if you want something less pretentious  Dominos is right here in the Emory Village PERIOD With all these options I wondered how The Local Pizzaiolo fourtime World Pizza Champion Giulio Adrianis latest neighborhood pizza place would distinguish itself from the gaggle of other pizzerias saturating Atlantas food scene PERIOD The differentiation would be especially critical to the average persons decision to visit the restaurant given that it takes Emory students nearly  minutes to get to the restaurant PERIOD

Within  minutes of sitting down our restaurant pagers rang and a waitress brought us our food PERIOD I opted for the margherita pizza the perfect vessel from which to assess the three most important things in a pizza cheese sauce and dough PERIOD The brilliant red tomato sauce served as the yin to the yang of the white moons of mozzarella PERIOD The crust itself wore a pale white cloak of dusted flour and was sparingly charred PERIOD On each of the four slices were small basil leaves of various sizes pruned and wilted from their trip in the oven PERIOD

Each thin slice melted in my mouth after a few seconds PERIOD Though this thinness made the meal light and refreshing the dough offered little resistance meaning nothing but the occasional bite of charred dough could harmonize with the soft meltiness of the tomato sauce and mozzarella PERIOD Though the sweet sauce complemented the mozzarellas gooey and creamy texture the tomatoes lacked the acidity to balance the savory mozzarella PERIOD The subtle peppery taste of the garnish added the needed zing absent from the sauce even if my four slices sported just two small basil leaves PERIOD My friends who had ordered more elaborate pizzas echoed my sentiment that the pizzas were smaller than average PERIOD

Though the thinness of each slice disappointed me my friend who ordered the When Pigs Fly pizza tomato sauce topped with prosciutto arugula mozzarella parmesan and olive oil argued that the fine proportions acted as the perfect medium for the toppings PERIOD Another friend enjoyed the truffle oil and bechamel of The Gypsy pizza but said the slices felt a little too light without a heavier dough PERIOD

The restaurant itself smelled strongly of flour and dough similar to what I imagine a local Italian bakery smells like PERIOD The interior elicited a nononsense and comfortable vibe adorned with simple chairs and sofas and missing the extraneous quirks of the classic millennial pizzeria like a chalkboard menu PERIOD The minimalism was refreshing PERIOD

The restaurant also displayed complimentary loaves of bread made of leftover dough near the cashier PERIOD The loaves are free with the restaurants request that takers pay it forward with an act of kindness for someone else PERIOD As a college student conditioned by the many free food events that grace campus daily I took the loaf  though I am still working on the act of kindness PERIOD

The menu displayed several options each with a corresponding picture to show you exactly what you would be eating PERIOD My friends and I ordered at the cash register before we chose our seats PERIOD On the comprehensive menu none of the options felt like a gimmick except for the Just The Crust option which was accompanied by a helpful picture of unadorned crust PERIOD

I find it difficult to recommend The Local Pizzaiolo as nothing justifies the aboveaverage price range of  to  PERIOD Though the ingredients are highquality they are not as highquality as Anticos PERIOD Though the prices are cheaper than those at Double Zero they arent as cheap as Blaze Pizza PERIOD The location is also farther from campus than these other pizzerias but the chain plans on opening a Toco Hills location sometime this summer PERIOD If you can keep yourself sated until then this might just be the pizza place for you PERIOD
