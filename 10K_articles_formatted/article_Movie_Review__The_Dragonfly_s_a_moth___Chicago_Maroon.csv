Directed by Tom Shadyac

104m PERIOD rated PG13

I went to see Dragonfly PERIOD I wound up seeing The Mothman Prophecies PERIOD Again PERIOD Oh the title may have referred to a carnivorous rather than an herbivorous insect and it may have had Kevin Costner instead of Richard Gere but theres no mistake  the movie I saw was The Mothman Prophecies PERIOD

Well at least the first quarter of Mothman Prophecies anyway PERIOD Past that point Mothman at least moved out of the hospital away from its obsession with supernaturally inspired drawings of the title entities and into an entirely new suspensefilled part of the plot PERIOD In other words the movie got a lot better PERIOD Dragonfly director Tom Shadyac and his committee of writers should have for their movies own good continued their copycat ways PERIOD Whats that you say Maybe Dragonfly wasnt spun in its entirety out of tired material purloined from Mothman To that I say dont be silly cinematic plagiarism happens all the time witness Antz vs PERIOD A Bugs Life Jeffrey Katzenberg you little devil and the entire career of Tom Arnold PERIOD Besides no one is dumb enough to write the Dragonfly script all by himself PERIOD

But write it they did PERIOD Sad to say the filmmakers decided to milk everything out of a hospital setting dont we get enough of that every Thursday night at   Central specifically a pediatric oncology ward PERIOD In that setting Kevin Costner is a doctor who cant seem to get enough of terminally ill kids all smacking of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense who draw eerie squiggles and claim to have had contact with his late wife PERIOD Without giving up too much important information I can say that this was far too similar to the worst parts  i.e. the first and last parts  of The Mothman Prophecies PERIOD Please somebody tell Hollywood that sometimes originality is a good idea PERIOD You dont get kicked out of the University of Chicago for it either PERIOD

I suppose I should say a little bit about the story if only to possibly delude you into seeing this movie PERIOD After all isnt that the point of writing movie reviews to pander to the lunkheads who pump the theaters full of dreck by hyping their decadesold rehashed storyline as the hottest movie of the year thereby getting eversomuch closer to a prestigious position with one of those totally dishonest publicity whores like Sixty Second Preview and Movie Minute Isnt that the point Of course it is PERIOD So prepare yourself to be mesmerized by the heartrending story of a man and his psychosis so totally awestruck by its appeal to every fiber of your body and mind that you will drop out of school immediately and spend every waking hour watching Dragonfly thus personally ensuring that it will break Titanics boxoffice records and earn the distinction of the best thing on earth PERIOD Ever PERIOD Better than God PERIOD Better than Nietzche PERIOD

The story youre going to love it Joe Darrow Costner loses his wife Emily when she plummets to her death in a bus trying to navigate a muddy mountain road in Venezuela PERIOD He doesnt believe in an afterlife but his disbelief is challenged by children who have come back from neardeath experiences and reported meeting Emily in the rainbow. after a barrage of dragonfly shaped squiggles unnerving occurrences at his house could Emily be trying to contact him How could they possibly have thought up such an ingenious plotpoint and a gaginducing visit with a nun who studies neardeath experiences Linda Hunt in a thankless role Joe hastily catches a plane to Venezuela to find the site where he believes his wife is telling him to go PERIOD

Though I cant speak for anyone else this is where the movie got really well intriguing for me PERIOD It seems Emily had been working on a medical mission of mercy among the Yanomam the people of the northern Amazon River basin who became well known after the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon used his work with them to prove that humans are naturally violent fractious beings PERIOD The Yanomam became even better known two years ago when a bestselling book claimed that Chagnon had faked all his findings started real conflict between Yanomam where there wasnt any before and even participated in eugenics experiments that may have introduced a virulent form of measles into the particularly vulnerable Yanomam PERIOD

With that as my own personal subtext I was wondering if the filmmakers would include any of this in their storyline PERIOD I should have known better PERIOD  The Yanomam that Joe encounters are cut from the same cloth as the Amazonian people that appear in the first segment of Raiders of the Lost Ark only with these points belabored they are wary of outsiders here xenophobia equals savagery  where is that equation in todays foreign policy they are suckers for pieces of eight and they are nevertheless spiritually inviolate and noble PERIOD Come to think of it they might as well be running the Vatican PERIOD

I realize that I havent actually delivered the detailed story recap that I promised but Im not sure you need or want to hear it anyway PERIOD Suffice it to say if Kevin Costner doesnt want to be considered a washedup actor he shouldnt be choosing washedup scripts PERIOD As I ohsosubtlely alluded to before Dragonfly is awfully awfully derivative  I swear based on the first  minutes of Mothman Prophecies alone there should be a lawsuit going on between whoever made those two movies PERIOD There really is nothing scintillating about the acting in Dragonfly either although Kathy Bates in a onenote role does play that note strong and in tune PERIOD Although only someone straight outta Mayberry wouldnt be able to see she was being set up to be a sympathetic lesbian character I liked this role better than her gonzo lesbian in Primary Colors PERIOD As for everybody else Forgettable PERIOD

I wish I could say the same for the rest of the movie but really it was a  harmless conceit exactly the kind of substandard film that I expect to see in the first months of the year when the studios bury movies that have no hope of box office or Oscar success PERIOD Many extraneous shots many caricaturish parts many cheap thrills  those are the hallmarks of studios throwaway movies and they give as good a sense of Dragonfly as anything else I could say PERIOD So what else will I say about Dragonfly May it rest in the peace of video distribution somewhere on the Blockbuster shelves between Crossroads and Glitter PERIOD

P.S PERIOD Heres a thought What if Emily was secretly giving the Yanomam measles I smell a sequel
