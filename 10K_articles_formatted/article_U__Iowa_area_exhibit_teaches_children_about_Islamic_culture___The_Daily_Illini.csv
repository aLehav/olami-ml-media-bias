The exhibit is about thinking over all the connections Executive Director Deb Dunkhase said while sitting near the puppet theater of the newly constructed exhibition PERIOD Its all centered on cultural understanding and peace. debuting on June  the sixmonth interactive exhibit began with a traveling art display titled The Many Colors of Islam. anissa Paulsen a former Peace Corps volunteer assembled the show as a means to promote cultural awareness for the differing shades of Islam  the worlds secondlargest religion  after the reactionary backlash post911 PERIOD
