You know when you feel the loneliest Its when youre in a crowd of people who are all excited to see each other and know each other and you dont know a soul PERIOD That was my experience on my first day returning to Hofstra University PERIOD Being a transfer student gives you a whole new perspective on college PERIOD Those first few weeks at a new school are more like a job you really hate than school PERIOD It was a lonely world for me PERIOD I saw so many people from my freshman year classes but I was too scared that they would not remember me PERIOD It was my junior year of college and it felt like I was the new kid in school again PERIOD

However I was no foreigner to Hofstra PERIOD As I mentioned earlier I was a former student of Hofstra PERIOD But I left after my freshman year due to a series of concussions and a diagnosis of PostConcussion Syndrome that affected my attention and grades PERIOD I transferred to Nassau Community College and enrolled into the Radiologic Technician program my second semester PERIOD Unfortunately I lost my classes at Nassau for this semester due to a billing error and found myself back at Hofstra PERIOD

Its amazing how much of a difference there is in workloads between the two schools PERIOD When compared to Hofstra Nassau is extremely easy PERIOD Im still adjusting to the difference PERIOD The extra readings the longer papers it all adds up for a transfer student PERIOD

Hofstra has a large amount of clubs and student organizations which could have guided me through the tough times I experienced transferring back PERIOD Instead I secluded myself and began to hate going to school PERIOD

I believe that if Hofstra recognized me and many other transfer students by offering and advertising specific services for us I believe this would lead to smoother transitions PERIOD It would have been nice to have gone to a transfer student luncheon and meet other people who are going through the same processes and learn how they are dealing with them PERIOD

However I got through that rough transition time and started reaching out to other people and old friends from my freshman year PERIOD Hofstra began to mean something to me again PERIOD I started going to the mens basketball games with my good friends PERIOD I began playing soccer with my old club team and started going out with different people PERIOD I began to go outside my comfort zone and reach for things I had never reached for before PERIOD

My best advice for the transfer students that are still struggling is to take chances PERIOD Getting involved is the best way to make the best of what is currently a tough situation PERIOD It doesnt mean rushing a fraternity or joining a club it just means to be more outgoing PERIOD Do things that you really want to do and dont hold back PERIOD With over four thousand students compacted into a space of less than four miles squared there is going to be someone who shares a lot of interests with you PERIOD

At this moment I love Hofstra PERIOD Its a great school that gave me a second chance and during the middle of this semester I gave Hofstra a second chance as well PERIOD It was tough in the beginning but I found out that if I put myself out there I will be happy PERIOD Now Im happy to be a part of Hofstra again PERIOD
