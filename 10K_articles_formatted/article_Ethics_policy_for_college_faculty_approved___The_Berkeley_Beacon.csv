7910,2023-11-01,"almost nine months after former Dean of Enrollment Daniel Pinch was fired for questionable practices Emersons Board of Trustees has voted to adopt official conflictofinterest guidelines for college studentaid employees and a separate outsideemployment ethics policy PERIOD

At their second meeting of the school year last week the Board ratified both policies which would have created clear ethical guidelines against Pinch for receiving  from a loanconsolidation company the college was recommending to students on its Web site PERIOD

At the time of his dismissal Emerson had no official conflict ofinterest policy for financial aid officers PERIOD

Vice President of Public Affairs David Rosen confirmed the vote and said the colleges new conflictofinterest policy closely resembles the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators 12point code of conduct which states that officers must disclose any business or financial interests with financialaid companies PERIOD

Specific guidelines in the twopage outsideemployment document include requiring staff members who wish to gain compensation from work outside the college to get signed permission from their direct supervisor and approval of that signature by Emersons Human Resources department PERIOD

HR must assess whether the outside work would present a conflict with the staff members job at the college PERIOD

The supervisor will not be able to approve the outside employment if the company does significant business with proceeds exceeding  or more with the college or if the work is with another college or university PERIOD The HR employee must also reject work that could hinder the staff members efficiency at their Emerson job PERIOD

The guidelines also state the colleges logo may not be used on promotional materials for a staff members other place of employment a conflict cited in the report resulting in Pinchs dismissal PERIOD

In the ninepage conflict of interest policy staff members are asked to remember that even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can cause severe damage to the colleges reputation. employees are banned from unauthorized use of confidential information about Emerson from using college resources and property for noncollege events and from submitting the schools financial reports to the government that are anything less than completely accurate PERIOD

The Board had discussed ratifying a specific conflict of interest policy at their first meeting last fall but decided to delay an official vote until the second meeting in the spring said Rosen who attended both meetings PERIOD

Despite the time gap Rosen said the Boards basic outline for a policy has remained consistent PERIOD

They always did the same policy tweaking various small things along the way Rosen said PERIOD People wanted to include specific language and examples. the document also contains a list of which gifts defined as any perk offered to a college employee or a member of his or her family in order for a company to obtain a business relationship with the school are seen as inappropriate PERIOD

Among acceptable gift items are promotional materials perishable products like food and flowers and social or ceremonial gifts where it would be awkward or impolite to decline. the meeting at which both policies were approved began with a threehour closed executive session followed by a ninety minute public meeting open to Emerson faculty Rosen said PERIOD

The Board of Trustees currently has  members including the colleges president Jacqueline Liebergott and television mavens Max Mutchnik and Kevin Bright of Will  Grace and Friends fame respectively PERIOD

Rosen said the Board spent about   minutes finalizing the policy prior to voting on it PERIOD

Before the vote the Board discussed a suggestion that the policy incorporate sixteen specific examples of what officers were allowed and not allowed to do PERIOD

Among those agreed upon as donts were a faculty member declaring support for a political candidate on college stationary accepting Red Sox tickets from a parent whose child has applied to Emerson and choosing to supply a college office with  worth of paper products while owning stock in Staples PERIOD

They had talked about it before so this meeting just required a report on small revisions Rosen said PERIOD They were made and they were accepted. cancel reply
