Some clouds PERIOD Low 56F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



As a historically troubled region the Middle East has had its
fair share of problems and political instability in the past PERIOD

The events taking place today in some of the Arab states
although seemingly shocking to some are a turn for the better in
what is a surprising change of events for the Arab people PERIOD

My belief is that the changes on the horizon do not make the
situation worse for the people PERIOD

In Egypt the antiMubarak protesters have called for his
immediate departure from the office staging days of protests such
as the day of rage and the day of departure PERIOD

The people are looking to democratize their nation after 
years of oppressive rule by Mubarak and that is indeed a positive
direction PERIOD

Similar protests in Tunisia demanding the ousting of former
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali sparked revolutionary ideas and
gave the Arab people the courage they needed to rise against years
of rule by tyrants and dictators PERIOD

The public in these countries were fed up with problems such as
high unemployment increasing pricesespecially of food and other
necessitiesand a decreasing standard of living just to mention a
few things PERIOD

People realized that a change has to take place and they were
ready to fight for it PERIOD Instead of talking the talk they had
decided it was time to walk the walk PERIOD

As a citizen of the United States a country where freedom of
speech is highly valued it is pleasing to see these people who
have been oppressed for decades in some cases standing up for
themselves and for democracy as is the case in Egypt Tunisia and
Yemen PERIOD

In the past few decades it seems like these Arab states and
the Middle East as a whole was a mere puppet to many of the games
played by the western powers PERIOD

It is heartening to see people taking matters into their own
hands rather than letting these appointed puppets run affairs to
the liking of foreign countries PERIOD

However seeing that radical groups are present in these states
these quasirevolutionary movements might take a turn for the worse
as was the case in Iran in the 1970s and again in  PERIOD In these
cases even further oppression of the people was the outcome PERIOD

Accordingly these situations need to handled very delicately
because mistakes could easily cost lives PERIOD

Perhaps the most interesting observation I made was the impact
of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter on these
protests PERIOD Such websites have offered everyone especially the
youth a platform to voice their dissent PERIOD

With lesser degrees of separation due to these social networking
platforms one can hope that people fighting for their rights and
working toward a democracy can learn to do so in a peaceful and
organized manner PERIOD
