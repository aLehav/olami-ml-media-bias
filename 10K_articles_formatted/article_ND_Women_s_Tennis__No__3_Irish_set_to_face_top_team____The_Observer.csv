Alex Barker  Friday April  

No PERIOD  Notre Dame  will try to rebound from its loss earlier this week against No PERIOD  Baylor as it hits the road for a fourgame road trip beginning with conference rival DePaul today PERIOD

The Irish will face the Blue Demons in Chicago before heading to Evanston Ill PERIOD for a rematch with No PERIOD  Northwestern Saturday PERIOD Sunday the team will head back to Chicago for a date with Marquette before ending its trip in Champaign against the Fighting Illini PERIOD

In its last outing against Baylor the team did not play up to the ability that it has displayed all season PERIOD

The matchups were a little different against Baylor in the singles and that hurt us Irish coach Jay Louderback said.We also won the doubles last time and not winning it this time made a big difference. after the setback against the Bears earlier this week Louderback knows the importance of bouncing back in a big way this weekend PERIOD

We really need to finish strong playing two of the top four Big East teams along with topranked Northwestern this weekend he said PERIOD

This weekends slate of games is a good preview to what Notre Dame will face heading into the Big East and NCAA Tournaments PERIOD DePaul and Marquette are two of the better teams in the conference and will present challenges to the Irish when they vie for the Big East championship in two weeks PERIOD

Northwestern this years indoor national champion has already shown that they are one of the top teams in the country and will most certainly be there in the end when the NCAA Championships roll around in midMay PERIOD

Playing four matches in five days which is what you have to do at the NCAA championships is a tough task Louderback said PERIOD It will be a great test for us. after this stretch of matches the Irish will just about have seen it all this season PERIOD They have already played  matches against top25 teams thus far six of which came against topseven opponents PERIOD

Louderback is thrilled with the idea of playing a tougher schedule than most and the postseason preparation that it offers his team PERIOD

It is good for us to have tough matches late in the year he said.It helps us get ready for the Big East and NCAA Tournaments. after this stretch of road matches the Irish will return home for their regularseason finale against Texas AM on April  PERIOD
