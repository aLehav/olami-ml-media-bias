Students in the universitys theatre program participated in the annual Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival breaking some of the universitys previous records in the program PERIOD

The festival was held in San Angelo Texas at Angelo State University from Wednesday Feb PERIOD  to Saturday March  PERIOD

Associate Professor of Acting and Directing James Winter shared his opinion of the students performances PERIOD

This was certainly one of our finest years at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival said Winter PERIOD Im incredibly proud of all of our students who attended this year. out of  students who attended three students became finalists in different categories with two students winning regional awards that offered national internships as prizes PERIOD

Senior general studies major Matthew Doyle won the Barbizon Award for Theatrical Design Excellence for which he was awarded an opportunity to present his work at the KCACTF National Festival in Washington D.C PERIOD

Doyle will also attend a oneweek master class in any concentration of his choice from the Stagecraft Institute of Las Vegas for his sound design in She Kills Monsters. he is the first person to receive this award for the university since  and the second student ever from the university to be invited to the KCACTF National Festival PERIOD Doyle expressed his thoughts on the awards PERIOD

Its great said Doyle PERIOD Honestly what it really is is a validation of a lot of the hard work that not just me but everyone involved in She Kills Monsters put in PERIOD I was allowed to create this awardwinning sound design because we had a play that was just so powerful that it gave me the space to operate in it PERIOD And I think thats ultimately what it comes down to. junior general studies major Miranda Miller who assisted Doyle in sound design of She Kills Monsters also won a oneweek master class from the Stagecraft Institute of Las Vegas for her sound design work in the movie PERIOD

Miller explained how the award gives students like her more opportunities in the field PERIOD

Its creating a rare opportunity for someone like me to travel and go study under professionals that do sound design said Miller PERIOD We dont offer classes on it here at Southeastern PERIOD So its given me an opportunity to go learn from people who do it professionally. doyle believes that his partnership with Miller also helped in making She Kills Monsters a success PERIOD

Honestly going back through the last four years of Southeastern plays if you check the credits I would say at least  to  percent of those plays involve both of us said Doyle PERIOD Its either her as the lead sound designer and me as the assistant or me as the lead sound designer and her as the assistant PERIOD And so we developed an unbelievably good professional working career PERIOD It helps that shes also my best friend so were able to bring those two things together. with this being Millers first time attending the annual festival she explained what gave her the confidence to attend PERIOD

What me and Matt worked on with the show from last semester She Kills Monsters it was like blood sweat and tears said Miller PERIOD We poured our life into it PERIOD Its definitely one of the best works we ever done. winter gave his insight on what he wanted students to take away from attending the festival PERIOD

I hope they come away from it stronger and more informed theatre artists with a deeper respect and understanding for the art form said Winter PERIOD I also hope they made new friends and connections. when it comes to what helped students stick out more this year Winter believes its their growing talent that helped them stand out as actresses and actors PERIOD

Matt and Miranda are incredible sound designers and deserving of all of their awards said Winter PERIOD Jordin Jones is an amazing actress and her partner Judah Fabre is equally as incredible PERIOD They barely missed the Irene Ryan finals last year so a part of me is not surprised that they made it this year PERIOD However for them to finish in the top  out of  teams is truly amazing PERIOD Sarah Balli is a fine young director who I am certain will go on to direct professionally and I was thrilled that she made it to the Student Directing finals. your donation will support The Lions Roar student journalists at Southeastern Louisiana University PERIOD
