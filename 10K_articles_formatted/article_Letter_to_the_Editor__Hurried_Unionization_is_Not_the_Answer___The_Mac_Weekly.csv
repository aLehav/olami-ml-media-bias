Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

The unionization issue is complex PERIOD Based on many many comments from our colleagues  both in an online forum as well as from a semesterlong reading group which formed this winter coincidentally around the issue of contingent faculty  many of us do not feel ready to make such a weighty decision PERIOD We are all academics after all a group of people who are notorious for doing research PERIOD Though weve been scrambling to gather information since we learned about the imminent vote we still lack a clear understanding of what it would mean to have a union represent us PERIOD In addition because the short time frame of this vote came as a surprise to most of us the unionization effort feels like something being forced upon us rather than something that came from us PERIOD

Given the abrupt way that this unionization vote has unfolded we do not have the option to delay a vote and give ourselves more time to do more research to figure out who we are a mix of parttime and fulltime leave replacements parttime and fulltime long term faculty members people going into retirement after a long career teaching at Mac people who teach just one or two courses etc. to decide what we want and to decide how to best go about achieving it PERIOD The union has not fostered open discussion of these issues which is troubling however discussions have been happening organically among a large group of contingent faculty which is steadily growing larger PERIOD There seems to be a hope that we will jump aboard swiftly because we will automatically equate union with better. we have not been given compelling reasons to jump so quickly onto that ship without having exhausted other options first PERIOD

Thus we think we would be doing ourselves a disservice by rushing to vote yes to unionizing PERIOD Voting no now is not a definitive no unionization vote PERIOD It simply slows things down PERIOD We would be able to restart the process if we wish after a fairly short waiting period one year PERIOD This would give us time to sort out the many questions we all have brought to the table PERIOD And we believe that a more thoughtful approach would put us in a better position to negotiate with the administration and with our tenured colleagues PERIOD Pausing this hurried process would also allow us to explore ways to address our issues within existing Macalester pathways in addition to unions other than SEIU whose tactics and approaches have made a few of us uncomfortable PERIOD

We understand the significance of this moment in terms of its broader implications for the state of higher education PERIOD Each of us is passionate not only about what we teach but also about the future of higher education as we train many of our students to become scholars graduate students and professors themselves PERIOD And we live the challenges of being socalled contingents every day of our lives they are tangible and real and they are extremely diverse PERIOD In many ways we might not have as much agency within our professional lives as many of us would like PERIOD Perhaps this is why so many of us are uncomfortable with the sudden appearance of a union on campus which while seeking to represent us has in fact neglected to give us the time to determine for ourselves what we need and want.The discomfort many of us feel comes from this question how can we hand over our collective voice to a third party when we are just beginning to articulate what that voice is We deserve the chance to determine this for ourselves without a looming deadline mere weeks away PERIOD

Contingent colleagues we are urging you to vote no in the upcoming union election for the sake of giving all of us a more reasonable time frame in which to take action on our own behalf PERIOD We can and should seize this moment as an opportunity for selfdetermination for a chance to have real conversations with our colleagues on both sides of the tenure divide and with the administration and to pursue avenues that develop after thoughtful discussion and research into all the options PERIOD
