The EnglishPhilosophy Building is seen on Wednesday Aug PERIOD   PERIOD

Madison Lotenschtein and Josie Fischels August  

Amid a summer of protests and societal push for change the University of Iowas Nonfiction Writing Program will see both internal and external shifts in the near future starting immediately this fall PERIOD

Students have called for the program to become a more racially equal diverse environment to learn in PERIOD All the while program administrators are amid planning to move from its location in the EnglishPhilosophy Building to the SanxayGilmore House one of the oldest documented buildings in Iowa City PERIOD

The property is in the midst of being relocated and renovated by the UI where it will become part of the universitys writing neighborhood as described by UI Senior Vice President of Finance and Operations Rod Lehnertz in a June  virtual state Board of Regents meeting PERIOD The house is near the Dey House and the Shambaugh House the homes of the Iowa Writers Workshop and International Writing Program respectively PERIOD

This would continue to advance the idea  of homes historic structures that host important and frankly nationally and internationally recognized writing programs in what we affectionately call the writing neighborhood Lehnertz said at the meeting PERIOD

The target movein date according to former Nonfiction Writing Program Director John DAgata is in fall  PERIOD Now that a new home for the program is official DAgata decided to step down from his position after seven years in order to focus more on writing and teaching PERIOD

Ive quietly been trying to step down as the NWPs director for the past few years because Ive never believed that art is served well under dynasties DAgata said in an email to The Daily Iowan PERIOD I think it flourishes best under change and flexibility and surprise PERIOD Art isnt meant to plant roots in the status quo its meant to look beyond whats happening now and imagine what else is possible PERIOD So Im excited to see the visions that the programs next few directors will bring to the NWP. while English department head Loren Glass said the programs official move to the house may be delayed due the coronavirus pandemic the eventual relocation will allow the program to have its own space like other UI writing programs already do PERIOD The Nonfiction writing Program will still be part of the English department PERIOD

They are the best nonfiction writing program in the country he said PERIOD I think they wanted to sort of have their own autonomous space and identity PERIOD I think itll be good for them to be out in the writing community in the city of literature like all the other writing programs. rELATED Iowa regents approve property transfer to allow relocation of historic Iowa City home

DAgata said the program has been searching for a home of its own since the late 90s  when DAgata was a student in the program PERIOD The UI found a house on Clinton Street for the program in  however that years flood caused the university to steer its attention toward arts buildings in need of new homes PERIOD

Then five years ago a few donors bestowed gifts to the Nonfiction Writing Program that were specific to finding a home for the program PERIOD

So we used that as an opportunity to remind the University that we were still looking for a space of our own DAgata said PERIOD Fortunately the SanxayGilmore house became available at that time and thanks to an impressive collaboration between the University and Iowa City itll now have a new life as a center for making great art. though its too early to tell what the houses interior will look like DAgata said the building will include classrooms faculty and student offices a lounge and a library PERIOD He said he hopes there will also be a space that caters to the programs events such as readings and lectures PERIOD

Whenever DAgata thinks about the purpose of having a building for the program he said he recalls what a donor said to him when explaining why she gave to the program PERIOD

She said Your students are the best young nonfiction writers in the country they deserve a building that reflects that DAgata said PERIOD So thats what well do with the space well use it to nurture the extraordinary talents of the undergraduate and graduate students who come to Iowa to study nonfiction giving them a dedicated place in which to experiment learn and build a community that will support them for their whole creative lives. though the move may be eventual more immediate changes within the program are already taking place PERIOD On July  faculty in the program published a response to a letter that had been addressed to them and former director John DAgata by  students within the program PERIOD

RELATED UI Diversity Councils dissatisfied with UI leaders Black Lives Matter response

The students letter demanded change within the writing program addressed student concerns and highlighted the programs lack of response toward the Black Lives Matter movement PERIOD The students detailed a list of  action items to be implemented by the program including a plan for the programs next hire to be Black and to require a yearly bias workshop for all incoming students and faculty PERIOD

Black students should be able to spend their time focusing on craft instead of losing energy dealing with racist encounters with faculty staff and students students wrote in the letter PERIOD Black students should not have to do extra work on top of course and teaching loads to receive the same quality of education that nonBlack students are afforded by default PERIOD Despite past communications from students regarding these issues whether asking for diverse faculty members admissions panels and syllabi or addressing microaggressions as a community there has been no concrete change that weve seen. the DI reached out to students who wrote the letter but they declined to comment at this time PERIOD

In their response two days later faculty stated that they would address all the changes that the students requested in order to make changes within the program PERIOD

While the letter stated that some of the changes will take time the program has already committed to having a more diverse pool of application screeners by the next round of admissions to the program including statements in the Nonfiction Writing Program facultys fall syllabi outlining plans and resources to address racism in the classroom texts by more Black writers in their syllabi without tokenizing or holding them separate from the canon and allowing all program students to count more than one outside course toward their degree PERIOD

Incoming Nonfiction Writing Program Associate Professor in English Melissa Febos said she was inspired by the students letter when she read it and is thrilled to be teaching the students who wrote it PERIOD Febos said she has already drafted a statement in her syllabus about creating an antiracist atmosphere that she will insist upon for all of her classes PERIOD

It seems to me that what theyre asking for in the program and the department is the kind of change that needs to be happening in programs all over the country so I feel really grateful to be joining the department at the time of this reckoning when it seems that theyre poised to make some really needed changes she said PERIOD

Created in June the blackatiowawriters Instagram account provides a space for Black UI students alumni faculty and staff to share stories of racism and mistreatment within the English department PERIOD Several people addressed their concern with the Nonfiction Writing Program by posting the students demands and other stories from the program PERIOD

One post specifically named DAgata alleging that he was part of the reason why so few graduates from the program over the past seven years have been Black PERIOD

Becasue DAgata does not use any form of social media he said he could not speak on the details of the Instagram post but does acknowledge the frustration toward the program in regards to its pace of constructing more diversity and inclusion along with how the program and the UI can improve support for Black students PERIOD

DAgata said that several issues that have been brought to light are ones that the program has already been working toward but that some institutional progress isnt always visible until its accomplished PERIOD DAgata said the English Department directed a search for new faculty in    and  where writers of color were their top candidates PERIOD

I chaired three of those searches and I sat on the committee of the fourth and I can tell you its frustrating for faculty too when weve got an amazing writer in front of us whom we want to hire but cant offer a competitive enough salary to convince that writer to come he said PERIOD

Departments do not control salary packages DAgata added but the universitys administration does PERIOD

It can be more than frustrating when we arent able to hire the faculty were trying to recruit it has actually been quite heartbreaking to see these writers go to other universities DAgata said PERIOD

Despite frustrations and the changes that lie ahead incoming Nonfiction Writing Program Interim Director Meenakshi Gigi Durham previously told the DIthat she is excited to bring her multicultural and transnational standpoint to the table PERIOD

I particularly look forward to advancing issues of racial and social justice in the program Durham said in an email to the DI PERIOD Im really excited about the new ideas visions and challenges the program is engaging with as we begin a new academic year and I cant wait to work with these talented new colleagues and students. the program has started to embed some new changes DAgata said but some may take more time to implement than others PERIOD

Other changes will take more time but the NWP considers its letter of response to our students a contract and we are committed to fulfilling it he said PERIOD
