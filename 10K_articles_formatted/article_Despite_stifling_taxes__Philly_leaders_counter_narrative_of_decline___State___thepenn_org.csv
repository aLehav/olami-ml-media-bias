Updated November     pm



The Center Square  For downtowns in the largest American cities leaders see a turning point coming in recovering from the pandemic and building for the future PERIOD

A lot of things that weve become frustrated with can be dramatically changed as we go forward  but not if we stay asleep Paul Levy leader of the Center City District in Philadelphia said in a keynote address during the Saul Ewing National Real Estate Conference on Thursday PERIOD This is the moment for business and civic leadership to shape the recovery. levy who has led the businessimprovement district in Philadelphia since  lamented that city leaders set up a disincentive in the form of a businessrepelling wage tax PERIOD Problems like slow economic growth high poverty rates and taxes before the pandemic were made even worse when COVID19 hit he said PERIOD

When I focus on the wage tax and business taxes that to me has been the biggest depressant of job growth in this city Levy said PERIOD

While demurring to endorse or oppose the proposed 76ers basketball arena on Market Street he argued the street was incomplete falling short of its potential as a visitor corridor PERIOD

I am in favor of really anything that can add density that can add vitality if it is welldesigned if its wellintegrated into the city and if we can manage its transportation impact Levy said PERIOD The arena is just the pretext for doing what we needed to do for the last  years which is fill in the gaps on Market East. the CCD released an analysis of downtown recovery in October noting that downtown numbers are still down but approaching  levels PERIOD Cities with a larger share of workers in industries where remote work is possible have been slower to recover as have cities with fewer residents who live close to work PERIOD

For recovery much of that action is out of the hands of mayors and elected officials PERIOD

They can however require local state and federal government workers to return to the office and avoid an urban doom loop Levy said PERIOD Frankly this needs to be done in the private sector taking the lead in terms of revitalizing their cities. though Philadelphia saw a dramatic spike in murders in  and residents worry about crime the financial stability of the public transit system and affordability concerns Levy argued against cynicism and the inevitability of decline PERIOD

Different leadership in this city different energy changes trajectory Levy said PERIOD Weve lived through these cycles before  we know how to do this  we just cant accept its gonna happen on its own its going to take really concerted leadership. originally published on thecentersquare.com part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange PERIOD
