Deciding on the best place to watch Purdue sports can often be a challenge for students with all the options on campus PERIOD

Choosing a place to watch games is often not a onetime decision PERIOD Evan Holland a senior in the Polytechnic Institute says his choice of location depends on the day of the game PERIOD

If its a weekend game we might go to the bars to enjoy the games in the company of other Boilermakers Holland said PERIOD For games that are played on weekdays Holland prefers to go to a friends house or watch it with my roommates at home. the bars on campus seem to be a popular choice amongst students  or older PERIOD Morgan Gyger a senior in the College of Engineering prefers to watch games at Brothers Bar  Grill PERIOD

Brothers is a nice place to watch them I enjoy it better than other bars Gyger said PERIOD In my opinion it has a nicer layout and has plenty of TVs. students under  also have many different places to choose from PERIOD Garrett Foster a freshman in the College of Engineering prefers to watch the games in his dorm room because it is convenient PERIOD

Usually watch them on my phone or computer in my dorm because the games are often at night Foster said PERIOD

Many students also gather in the common areas of their dorms to watch the games together PERIOD

The location and people one chooses to watch the games with can make them much more enjoyable PERIOD

I think what is special about college sports is the atmosphere that brings everyone together to root for our team Holland said PERIOD
