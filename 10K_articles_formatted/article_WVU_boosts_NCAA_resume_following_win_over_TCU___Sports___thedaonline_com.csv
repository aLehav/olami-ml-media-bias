Lanay Montgomery goes between two defenders for a powerful layup PERIOD

Thanks to  points from both junior forward Teana Muldrow and sophomore guard Tynice Martin the West Virginia University womens basketball team put itself one step closer to an NCAA Tournament atlarge bid holding off a resilient TCU squad  on Wednesday night PERIOD

The Mountaineers   Big  have now won three of their last four games and now have just two games remaining in the regular season PERIOD

Teana came up big for us head coach Mike Carey said PERIOD Tynice shot the ball pretty well just way too many turnovers PERIOD We said going down the stretch that we needed to win three in a row here cant win three in a row unless you win the first one PERIOD So it might be an ugly win but we need all ugly wins PERIOD Ill take two more ugly wins going down the stretch. with Selection Monday just a couple weeks away every game is a mustwin for the Mountaineers at this point in the season PERIOD

Martin continued her run of strong play scoring  of her  points in the first half PERIOD Her ability to create shots for herself and score the ball bailed WVU out offensively several times PERIOD

TCUs occasional switch to a  zone caused the Mountaineers some issues at times but Martins midrange game and Muldrows ability to space the floor helped WVU to break it down PERIOD

WVU really struggled in the paint and around the rim early on as the Horned Frogs jumped out to a  lead at the end of the first quarter PERIOD

The Mountaineers were forced to play without center Lanay Montgomery for pretty much the entire first half PERIOD The senior picked up two quick fouls in the first minute of the game and was forced to sit on the bench for the remainder of the half PERIOD

Muldrow picked up the slack in the post in Montgomerys absence PERIOD

Lanay Montgomery got into foul trouble early and Teana had to play a lot more minutes and did a great job Carey said PERIOD

Muldrow came into the game just five points off  for her career PERIOD She became the thirty-third Mountaineer to score  points about midway through the second quarter PERIOD Her  points were a career high adding  rebounds as well to complete the doubledouble PERIOD

In the second half the Mountaineers really got the highlow game between Muldrow and Montgomery going as the duo took turns feeding each other in the post PERIOD

At the end of the third quarter the Horned Frogs went on a scoring drought that saw them go 1for10 allowing the Mountaineers to extend the lead to  PERIOD

But the Horned Frogs managed to hang around thanks to  WVU turnovers PERIOD

We didnt execute down the stretch turnovers and all that throwing it backcourt Carey said PERIOD We did everything we could to let them back in the game but at least we were able to get the win. after a TCU scoring run cut the lead to two late in the fourth quarter the Mountaineers responded with a run of their own and didnt look back PERIOD

The Horned Frogs did what they could to try to get back into it but WVU hit its free throws down the stretch to ice the game PERIOD

TCU guards AJ Alix and Kianna Ray the former the teams leading scorer at  points per game came into the game both shooting over  percent from 3point range this season PERIOD Alix managed to finish with  points including 3of6 shooting from three but the Mountaineers held Ray to just one point PERIOD

This week ESPN.coms resident womens basketball Bracketologist Charlie Creme has the Mountaineers as a No PERIOD  seed in the Oklahoma City region facing No PERIOD  seed Creighton in the first round PERIOD

WVUs RPI ranking is No PERIOD  which leaves them very little margin for error PERIOD

Winning the final two games at Oklahoma State at home against Kansas  thus getting to . in conference play  would go a long way towards helping WVU secure an atlarge bid to the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

I think we have to win some more games Carey said PERIOD We need to win these next two and go win one or two in the tournament PERIOD We lose one of these games then we have to win more in the tournament PERIOD Were on the bubble and thats how we have to play PERIOD Every game is an NCAA game for us right now. want to report a sports score or pass on some sports news Use this form PERIOD
