This column highlights music worth listening to that has been released between issues of The Pioneer Log PERIOD All genres and artists are considered and generally four of five albums are chosen PERIOD

O3 Greedo and Kenny Beats  Netflix  Deal

Much of Netflix  Deal was made in the weeks before  Greedo began his 20year prison sentence PERIOD This album does not sound rushed despite his time crunch PERIOD If anything this comes off as Greedos farthestreaching album in terms of its concept PERIOD Most songs allude to either explicitly or implicity Greedos favorite movies Blow Paid in Full and Maria Full of Grace. these movies and the album itself all revel in the glory and grit of being a successful drug dealer PERIOD It is no coincidence that they were all released during Greedos lateteens PERIOD Their exploration of the drug world helped define the selfassured don Greedo plays in his music PERIOD Kenny Beats instrumentals along with Greedos catchy and offkilter autotune melodies ensure that any song on this album could work as a single PERIOD It would be too easy to put these songs under the umbrella of trap PERIOD Sure Greedo raps about drugs over bass and hihat triplets PERIOD But Greedo separates himself through wise and soulful demeanor and Kennys mixes allow him to explore farther reaches of the genre even interpolating disco on the track with Freddie Gibbs PERIOD

Vegyn  Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds

Vegyn has already proved himself to be a fresh and charming producer in his songs with Frank Ocean AAP Mob and JPEGMAFIA PERIOD On Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds Vegyn is working fully on his own terrain PERIOD These  shorter tracks maintain a bouncy energy all the way through PERIOD His music has a clear sense of humor and joy that comes across in the drums and synths PERIOD The choice of sounds seems to come from Vegyns amusement in how exciting glitchy dance elements come together to create well manicured electronic music PERIOD The punches from the percussion are satisfying the synths are lively and unpredictable and the samples are all artfully woven in PERIOD

FKA Twigs  MAGDALENE

FKA Twigs is a virtuoso in transforming pain into beauty PERIOD MAGDALENE explores the separation and alienation Twigs experienced in the interim between this project and her last PERIOD This separation both from a former romantic partner and the world forced her to strip down her sound to its barest essence PERIOD There is not a second of wasted space on this album PERIOD Twigs herself said that she agonized over making this album perfect as she knew that anything less than that would be ripped apart PERIOD The flow of each song and the entire album compel the listener to submit to the music PERIOD Both silence and intense noise are used studiously the pacing is masterfully well done PERIOD The instrumentals are harsh and expressively cold PERIOD Hard drums glitchy accents and distant synths accompany Twigs melodically beautiful voice PERIOD Although her voice is melodious it does not act as a reprieve from the instrumentals instead they are hopelessly intertwined PERIOD FKA Twigs is surviving on her own terms creating music that gracefully pushes the boundaries of pop music and albums about departure from others and the past PERIOD

Arthur Russell  Iowa Dream

Arthur Russell was a trained cellist who studied composition and traditional Indian music and was an important figure in the experimental music scene in New York City in the 1970s PERIOD Since his premature death in  his estate has allowed for the formal release of songs and demos left behind by Russell. iowa Dream is one such posthumous compilation of demos mostly recorded in sessions in  and  PERIOD Russell is no stranger to playing between the genre lines PERIOD Like his diverse yet shortlived career the album seamlessly moves through genres like folk pop and disco PERIOD Compared to his previous releases Iowa Dream contains a higher proportion of folk sounds PERIOD These folkier instrumentals fit beautifully with Russells halcyon yet poignant delivery PERIOD Songs like Words of Love prove that Russell is just as gifted and gripping with his voice accompanied by just a guitar or piano as he is with his usual experimental sounds such as those found on his  classic World of Echo. trail Blazers earn resounding victory against OKC Thunder
