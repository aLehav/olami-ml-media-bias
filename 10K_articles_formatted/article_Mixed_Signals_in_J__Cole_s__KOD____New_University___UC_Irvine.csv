2644,2023-11-04,"coles latest album serves as a lopsided if not weak antidrug PSA with its strongest moments coming from its personal tangents and commentary on current events PERIOD While the album art title and various bars try to guide listeners away from the harmful effects of narcotics the uneven lyrics and mismatching themes of his songs make it unnecessarily difficult to comprehend his true intentions on a given track PERIOD

Take the opening track KOD on which Cole boldly explains that his reluctance to feature other artists on his projects is due to his superiority to other rappers in the game PERIOD Its cocky and could come off as arrogant but Coles angry harsh delivery truly sells his belief that he is on a level above his contemporaries PERIOD However the hooks braggadocious story of a drug dealer purchasing expensive cars and making insane amounts of money comes out of left field PERIOD

Its lyrical decisions like these that make it difficult to tell what Coles true motivations behind a song really are PERIOD Is the hook supposed to imply that hes speaking through a persona meaning the song should not be taken literally If so does this apply to the main verses of the song or just the hook Or is the hook just a critique of those in the drug trade randomly inserted into the song in order to align the track with the rest of the album

Several songs suffer from this lack of a clear message making potentially powerful messages muddled and left with a dangerously high opportunity to be interpreted with a dangerous connotation PERIOD Photograph is Coles Instagramera love song detailing a stalker falling in love with a girl through her online photos eventually developing an unhealthy amount of jealousy and anxiety thinking about his interactions with her in the digital realm PERIOD

As a parody of modern romance its a strong track accurately exposing the disturbing often obsessive fervor with which people latch onto social media personalities and the blind expectation that love can and should be reciprocated through online interactions PERIOD It would be wonderful to broadcast this message to Coles broad audience but the song leaves much to be desired PERIOD Coles narrator receives no gutpunch realization that his actions and feelings are misguided with the most selfaware lyrics in the track coming in each hooks Love todays gone digital  And its messing with my health. with no resolution in the song it would be simple to interpret it as a forlorn lovers anthem a rallying cry for people lets admit it  men on the internet to creepily pine for their Instagram crushes with a newfound vigor now that their favorite rapper seems to understand their predicament PERIOD This doesnt seem to be  and shouldnt be  the message of the song but its difficult to make a case for the contrary PERIOD

That being said there are songs on this album that deftly discuss current events in a mature and emotionally satisfying manner PERIOD Kevins Heart is a notsosubtle analysis of Kevin Harts infidelity with his pregnant wife PERIOD He discusses the difficulty he has with staying loyal to his girlfriend mirroring the situation Hart assumedly went through with his own wife PERIOD Its a very humanizing song baring Coles weaknesses and vices beautifully sung with arguably his best flow on the album PERIOD An added bonus is the surprisingly beautiful music video starring Kevin Hart himself PERIOD

Other standouts include Window Pain and Once an Addict two songs laying out his feelings for his mothers struggles with addiction as well as his lovehate relationship with the neighborhood he grew up in PERIOD These songs hit the emotional and societal peaks his album should have hit with every track but sadly fell short of more often than not PERIOD

 is equally powerful steering away from his personal convictions and instead instructing upcoming young rappers to tread carefully in the industry PERIOD Its much less of the diss track many have branded it as and more of a veterans passing of wisdom to his ward PERIOD His pleadings for young artists to spend their money wisely is sage and most of the warnings he imparts can easily be applied to anyone entering the job market PERIOD

Productionwise most of Coles tracks have simple beats that much like his lyrics vary in effectiveness PERIOD His strongest bars are featured on the most appealing beats with the hypnotic warbling synths of Kevins Heart beautifully complimenting the songs somber lyrics and the aggressive bass of Window Pain accentuates Coles bittersweet feelings for the place he grew up and the people he has subsequently left behind PERIOD

The weak areas of his production style are on full display with Motiv8 which despite its name has one of the slowest and least interesting sound composition in the project PERIOD Its far from a motivating song and is easily the sonic low of the album PERIOD

KOD is an easy  neither blowing minds with its antidrugproself care messages nor completely bombing with its worst tracks PERIOD
