In a key section of the report read to the Associated Press by council diplomats Blix says Saddam could have made greater efforts to find remaining proscribed items or credible evidence showing the absence of such items. other sections of the report cited positive examples of Iraqi cooperation but said it was hard to understand why a number of the measures which are now being taken could not have been initiated earlier PERIOD If they had been taken earlier they might have borne fruit Blix wrote PERIOD

In a letter to Blix on Thursday Iraq agreed in principle to destroy its Al Samoud  missiles U.N PERIOD diplomats and officials said on condition of anonymity PERIOD
But it wasnt immediately clear whether Iraqs letter constituted an unconditional acceptance and whether Iraq would meet the Saturday deadline to begin the destruction as Blix has ordered PERIOD
Blix told reporters earlier this week that the missile issue would be a key test of Iraqs cooperation PERIOD
While Blix has noted some recent Iraqi cooperation he lamented in his report It is hard to understand why a number of the measures which are now being taken could not have been initiated earlier. nonetheless he noted that inspections resumed only in November after a fouryear break and asked Is it the right time to close the door
The U.S PERIOD draft resolution authorizing war was presented earlier this week by the United States Britain and Spain PERIOD
There was some evidence that support for the resolution was gaining ground including signals that Mexico had changed its strong antiwar stance PERIOD
Pakistan is also a key vote PERIOD Iraq and the United States each sent envoys to Islamabad on Thursday to state their case PERIOD
Islamabad has not revealed whether it would support the U.S PERIOD resolution although Pakistani diplomats said privately that the Muslim country would likely abstain PERIOD Theres almost no possibility that Pakistan would vote against the United States and some within President Pervez Musharrafs administration say Islamabad is considering voting with Washington PERIOD
