JMU softball gathers at home plate to celebrate a home run against College of Charleston

Two years ago JMU softball rolled into Ann Arbor Michigan ready to play in a regional that arguably shouldve taken place in Harrisonburg PERIOD Cruising past DePaul  in game one JMU took on the host and the Michigan Wolverines took down the Dukes  in a  inning showdown  one featuring former JMU pitcher Megan Good PERIOD

Despite the loss JMU went on to win three straight two against Michigan to advance and play the eventual champions at UCLA PERIOD Even though the Dukes fell in the superregional round they proved that they deserved a seed and should be taken seriously as a top softball program PERIOD

Now almost exactly two years later JMU softball hits the road again  this time to Knoxville Tennessee  to face Liberty PERIOD The CAA champions will be facing Eastern Kentucky in addition to Liberty as well as the host in No PERIOD  Tennessee PERIOD

I think were really excited to show what we can do and show the JMU Dukes redshirt junior outfielder Logan Newton said PERIOD We didnt have the ability to play a lot of ranked teams  its going to be really interesting to play Liberty and Tennessee. jMU has been dominant all year  theres no question about it PERIOD Holding the longest active win streak in college softball the Dukes outscored their opponents  in the regular season and conference tournament PERIOD Its no secret that JMUs offense is highflying and that its defense stands strong however when it comes to the strength of schedule the statistics arent in JMUs favor PERIOD

Although the Dukes play in a weaker conference compared to the ACC or SEC theyre still dominant and performing on this big stage isnt a new concept PERIOD This is the second time JMU is heading down to Knoxville for a regional and the team looks very similar to the team that defeated Michigan in  PERIOD

I feel like at practice every day we just work hard redshirt junior infielder Sara Jubas said PERIOD I think we put in our best effort and that just transfers onto the field. it starts with the pitching and JMU has soared all year in the circle PERIOD While redshirt senior Odicci Alexander has made a name for herself through the years she suffered an early injury in the JMU Invitational and others had to step up PERIOD Freshman pitcher Alissa Humphrey became a sensation in her first year at JMU with an ERA of . and  strikeouts PERIOD Humphrey posted four nohitters on the season including one against Drexel on May  to send the Dukes to the CAA Championship PERIOD

Now of course experience is important. while Humphrey as well as redshirt junior pitcher Alexis Bermudez held the team together in Alexanders absence her return gave JMU depth at pitcher PERIOD Alexander had six shutouts and posted a  record despite an injury PERIOD To be successful this weekend the Dukes pitching will need to stay at the top of their game PERIOD

All season the pitchers have been just so locked in JMU head coach Loren LaPorte said PERIOD The amount of video and things they are doing on their own time is pretty spectacular  all of them are just prepared when they step on the mound. opposite of the pitchers are the batters and when JMU steps up to the plate its high flying PERIOD The Dukes will enter the Knoxville Regional with its healthy highscoring batting order thats been constantly at the top of their game PERIOD It starts with redshirt senior outfielder Kate Gordon whos the D1 Softball Player of the Week heading into regionals PERIOD Gordon has  home runs and  hits this season at the leadoff position PERIOD

Jubas Newton redshirt senior Madison Naujokas and redshirt junior Lynsey Meeks are in the top half of the order and constantly get on base. each has at least  RBIs and four home runs accounted for PERIOD Theyre the most experienced on the team and always using each others momentum and setting up the bottom half of the order to do well at bat and drive runs in.The whole batting order is talented experienced and poised to make a run in Knoxville PERIOD

Theyre pretty experienced with competing at a high level LaPorte said PERIOD Hopefully they can carry that into Tennessee this weekend. while the Dukes are consistent in both the outfield and at the plate to make it out of the Regional theyll have to play their best softball yet PERIOD Liberty is a team very similar to JMU and Tennessee is No PERIOD  for a reason PERIOD

Looking ahead at the Flames they have quality wins on the year and are led by experienced players PERIOD Libertys beaten Notre Dame Virginia Tech and No PERIOD  Arkansas  a topsix seed all teams that made the field of  PERIOD At  the Flames won the Atlantic Sun Conference to punch their ticket to the tournament PERIOD

The Bishop sisters are the hitters to watch for Liberty PERIOD Amber and Autumn Bishop are super seniors have been on this stage before and are playing for their softball lives PERIOD The sisters have  home runs combined and are both over . hitting PERIOD In the circle for Liberty is junior pitcher Emily Kirby and shes been stellar all year in Lynchburg posting a  PERIOD  ERA and  strikeouts PERIOD

Itll be super important for us to set the tone of the game Newton said PERIOD It takes a little bit of pressure off our pitchers immediately to where they can be the best that they can be. for the Volunteers this is their chance to redeem themselves from the SEC tournament where they blew a lead to Alabama in the semifinals PERIOD Tennessee is home but the upset potential in Knoxville is very real PERIOD

Tennessee was   SEC this year behind junior pitcher Ashley Rogers PERIOD Rogers posted a . eRA over  innings pitched this spring and struck out  batters PERIOD While the Volunteers arent as powerful as in years past they play the long ball by keeping runners on base controlling the outs and hitting at the right time PERIOD Sophomore outfielder Kiki Milloy and senior utility Ivy Davis both have over  home runs PERIOD

While JMU is excited to be at another regional this trip means more said LaPorte PERIOD In a season that came with COVID19 testing new practice protocols and a different schedule to make the NCAA tournament is a big accomplishment  and not one to take lightly PERIOD

Although in the past there were only a couple of Dukes graduating at the tournaments end this year there are both seniors and super seniors PERIOD Newton said the players never know when this game will be their last so no matter the circumstance they have to give everything they have to every pitch PERIOD

When they step on the field and its game time they are literally leaving everything they have on the field LaPorte said PERIOD At this point in their head they dont know when its their last  the groups been together a very long time they know how each other plays and when you have a team like that unity wise its pretty special. while JMUs strength of schedule doesnt compare to that of Liberty and Tennessees its not an everyday accomplishment to blow out all opponents and for the pitcher to see more nohitters than not PERIOD JMU has talent experience with a mix of old and young personalities that has the potential to get the job done in Knoxville PERIOD Now its up to them to give Tennessee a little taste of Harrisonburg PERIOD
