The roof of the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts could become a site for harnessing solar power energy in the near future PERIOD

The plan has been proposed by the Western Massachusetts Electric Co PERIOD as a part of  million solar energy plan PERIOD The plan could involve leasing the roof space of the FAC in order to install photovoltaic solar panels which would generate a portion of the companys energy supply PERIOD

In  Gov PERIOD Deval Patrick initiated a statewide plan to expand solar energy production when he passed the Green Communities Act PERIOD

The act stipulates that utility companies must purchase new technology that improves energy efficiency whenever the costs of these new implements are cheaper than the current processes. according to the governors official website The Green Communities Act is meant to help Massachusetts achieve  megawatts of solar energy by  thereby lowering the overall demand on the system and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. on Feb PERIOD  a WMECO press release listed the FAC roof as the first of several buildings around western Massachusetts that the company sees as potential sites for solar facilities. according to Jason Burbank UMass campus engineer WMECO and UMass have been in discussions about other ground sites on campus that could potentially offer surface space for photovoltaic installation as well. sandra Ahearn spokeswoman for WMECO described the photovoltaic cells as reflective panels that absorb the suns rays PERIOD These rays are converted to energy which is then transmitted back through the WMECO power grid and used to supply energy to the companys customers. wMECO says the technology although not yet widespread will be safe for both the building and the students PERIOD

The entire WMEC0 project expected to be expanded through  and  could achieve  megawatts of solar power PERIOD The solar power generated would be enough to power nearly  homes according to the press release PERIOD

The target area of the FAC is the concrete bridge running east to west along the top floor. this section of the roof has a southfacing slope that is regularly exposed to intense sunlight. both WMEC0 and Burbank seem sure that any possible construction on the building will not inhibit students use of the FAC facilities PERIOD

Burbank feels optimistic about UMass involvement in the project stating that the university would gain some benefit either electricity or financial compensation. burbank was also glad that the FAC site could be so wonderfully visible to students and the community PERIOD

Some UMass students are also excited about the possible benefits that the project may have PERIOD

I think its a great cooperation between UMass and WMECO said Tim Sine a junior geology major PERIOD I think its great that UMass can be part of the states legislation. agreeing to rent roof space to WMEC0 is a harmless and friendly endeavor that could only help UMass said Lindsey Athananison a junior sociology major PERIOD It is a smart way to raise extra funds amid the severe budget crisis PERIOD

In addition to the financial incentives that the university may gain from leasing the FAC roof Burbank hopes the project could also help out the FAC PERIOD Burbank points out that WMECO proposes to mount the solar panels on a concrete wall that is not insulated. if we insulate the wall at the same time we will save as much energy as we gain from the solar panels said Burbank PERIOD

Students should not expect to see any changes to the FAC during this school year. wMECO only recently submitted a proposal to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities PERIOD Ahearn said the company expects a decision in the next six months. even if the government approves the project Ahearn explains that the photovoltaic cells would not be fully installed until sometime in late  PERIOD

Burbank cautioned against too much preemptive speculation claiming that the project is not a done deal yet. claire Bronchuk can be reached at emailprotected
