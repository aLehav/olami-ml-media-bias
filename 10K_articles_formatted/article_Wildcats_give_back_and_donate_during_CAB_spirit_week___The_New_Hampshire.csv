During the celebration of spirit week Wildcats participated in giving back to their community PERIOD As part of the fiveday event organized by the Campus Activities Board CAB a food drive was held on Sept PERIOD  to celebrate Wildcats Give Back Wednesday. all canned donations collected by CAB will be given to Cornucopia a food pantry run within the local community outreach organization The Waysmeet Center PERIOD

According to Billy Boyce a member of CABs homecoming committee the goal of Wildcats Give Back Wednesday was to give back to the community PERIOD Boyce who was also in charge of Wednesdays event said CAB reached out to different organizations on campus such as Greek life and residence halls to better involve members of the community PERIOD With CABs efforts and peoples generous donations Cornucopia will receive three mediumsized boxes of canned goods PERIOD

Run as a subset of The Waysmeet Center the food pantry seeks to provide food and support in a loving nonjudgmental way PERIOD According to Reverend Larry BricknerWood chaplain and executive director of Waysmeet everything is free at Cornucopia PERIOD And unlike most New Hampshire food pantries Cornucopia does not limit the amount of food taken by its patrons PERIOD

Though recipients are required to register with the food pantry no income guidelines or identification are needed to collect food PERIOD BricknerWood stated our assumption is if youre here you need it. last year between its two days of operation Cornucopia served around  to  customers a week PERIOD According to BricknerWood most of those patrons represented a fourperson family PERIOD The high volume of people served means Cornucopia is always in need of food PERIOD

BricknerWood says the pantry is sustained by donations from the New Hampshire Food Bank an organization that takes food from local establishments that would be wasted otherwise and gives it to food pantries PERIOD

Cornucopia contains two large freezers fully stocked with meats and two smaller refrigerators full of fresh produce PERIOD Bags of organic apples and locally baked bread can be seen among the canned and boxed goods PERIOD BricknerWood says they want not only food but fresh food. when asked if Wildcats Giveback Wednesday was a success Boyce said it was very successful and he hopes CAB will be able to coordinate annual giving back events PERIOD

Student community involvement is something Jen Turner last years coordinator of Cornucopia clearly supports PERIOD

I think all the students at UNH should be involved in the community said Turnerits easy to forget about those in need when we have a dining hall. when asked how he felt about CAB dedicating a day of spirit week to giving back to the community BricknerWood was enthusiastic PERIOD

I think its a great idea even in times of celebration there are others who find it hard to celebrate said BricknerWood were really happy to be a recipient of peoples generosity and good work. the Student News Site of University of New Hampshire
