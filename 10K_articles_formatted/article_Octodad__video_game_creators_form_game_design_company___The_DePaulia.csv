November 3On Day of the Dead a grieving community celebrates the lives of Chicago women murdered or disappeared and seek justice Shes not forgotten and shes still loved

In  a group of DePaul students in the College of Computing and Digital Media developed a computer game based on the daily challenges of being a dad PERIOD But the protagonist isnt an ordinary dad  hes an octopus disguised as a human PERIOD The absurdity of the character combined with the ordinary tasks and challenges made the game called Octodad a big success PERIOD

Now alumni the group has since formed a game design company and will release the sequel to their first game Jan PERIOD  PERIOD In the new game titled Octodad Dadliest Catch players will navigate the clumsy cephalopod through the daily challenges of shopping for groceries making coffee and mowing the lawn PERIOD Octodad will also venture to the aquarium at the request of his unsuspecting wife and will have to fight the evil sushi chef who wants to reveal his secret identity to his family PERIOD

It started out as a silly game but then as it progressed it became more about exploring the themes of family and trust and keeping secrets from people you love Nick Esparza one of the games developers said PERIOD

The combination of silliness and deeper family themes caused Phil Tibitoski another developer to liken it to a Pixar or Disney film PERIOD And like many of the popular animated films today the humor in the game is intended to satisfy a range of ages PERIOD

In a review of the Octodad for the video game website 1UP associate editor Marty Sliva said Octodad may be gamings first slapstick comedy. while not unusual in the world of animated film comedy is a relatively new genre in the gaming world PERIOD Esparza said the humor is different in Octodad because it does not come from the dialogue alone PERIOD Its funny because of the clumsy way the octopus moves around and fails to grasp objects the way a human would PERIOD

The Octodad games are not traditional in the game world but that might be a cause for its success PERIOD

Its basically the same thing as indie music to Top  Tibitoski said PERIOD Were just trying to do something different PERIOD Now theres finally an audience for that and that audience is finally realizing we exist. while the Octodad sequel is more or less an extension of the original game a lot has changed for the former students who designed the first game for a school competition PERIOD The biggest change happened when most of them decided to form their own game development company Young Horses which is made up of nine members PERIOD

Starting our company has been a very weird different thing because none of us are business majors none of us took business classes Tibitoski said PERIOD It was just like starting from scratch. the team had some help from their advisors for the first game CDM professor Scott Roberts and former professor Patrick Curry but most of the work they did this time was on their own PERIOD

They held a Kickstarter campaign in July  and raised  which covered the costs of starting up the business PERIOD They funded the rest of their efforts with outside jobs PERIOD Some worked parttime others fulltime PERIOD

None of the creators of the game are more than  years old and many completed their undergraduate degrees just a few years ago PERIOD Despite their young age however Roberts has confidence in their ability to succeed PERIOD

Its one thing to have a game be liked and be popular but they really took a risk  they really took a gamble on the success of the game because they believed in it Roberts said PERIOD

The success of the first game has inspired confidence in the team as well PERIOD The original game was free but it has had been downloaded more than  times PERIOD

In addition theyve received critical acclaim from inside the game industry PERIOD Last spring Sony sought out the team and offered to release Octodad Dadliest Catch on the PlayStation  PERIOD They accepted the offer and the game will be released on the new platform in March PERIOD

The majority of the Young Horses members plan to stay with their fledgling company if the new game takes off PERIOD Tibitoski defined success as making enough money off of the new game which will come with a price tag to be able to keep the company going and put out another game PERIOD

Others like Esparza may not stick with the company but he said the experience hes gained from it has been invaluable PERIOD

I still kind of want to try my hand at big games and big movies Esparza said PERIOD Its been my dream since I was a kid but this is definitely going to inform how I approach any sort of job or anything that I do for the future PERIOD Its been incredibly interesting PERIOD Its really valuable. octodad Dadliest Catch will be available Jan PERIOD  PERIOD It can be downloaded from games website or from the game distributing websites Steam and GOG PERIOD
