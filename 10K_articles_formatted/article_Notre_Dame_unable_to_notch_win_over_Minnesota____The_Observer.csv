Connor Mulvena  Monday February  

The Notre Dame hockey team in an important conference matchup managed to tie one and lose one against Minnesota one of the hottest teams in college hockey right now PERIOD The winless weekend brings the Irish to  overall with a  record in the competitive Big Ten PERIOD

Coming off of a bye the Irish got off to a slow start Friday night finding themselves down  in the first period after junior forward Scott Reedy and sophomore forward Blake McLaughlin of Minnesota slotted two early on PERIOD Reedys goal came just  seconds into the first period and McLaughlins came  minutes into the contest PERIOD

The Irish managed to bounce back quickly as junior forward Colin Theisen found the back of the net just  seconds after McLaughlins score PERIOD Sophomore defenseman Nick Leivermann would add to the efforts and tie the game early in the second with his fifth career goal PERIOD The contest ended up going into overtime at  and after no winner was declared in the overtime period Minnesota took home the conference point after winning the shootout PERIOD

After the game Irish head coach Jeff Jackson attributed the slow start to the bye week and said overall his team did a pretty good job against a good Minnesota team PERIOD

It was playoff hockey basically PERIOD It was a good game PERIOD My only disappointment was falling behind  chasing the game PERIOD But we came back PERIOD We took the lead in the second period PERIOD You just hope you could hang on to finish it off he said PERIOD Its usually the first period after a bye week that you struggle a bit PERIOD I didnt think we struggled that poorly it was just that Minnesotas top line scored a couple of nice goals and we didnt defend real well off either one of them frankly PERIOD The first one was just a tough bounce at the point PERIOD The second one was more of a rush situation PERIOD But I thought we played pretty well for the most part PERIOD I thought all four lines did a pretty good job our defense did a pretty good job PERIOD We just have to come back at them tomorrow. after a tough battle on night one the Irish were unable to redeem the shootout loss in night two succumbing to the Gophers  in a close battle PERIOD

Things didnt start as quickly in the second game for either squad as the first period ended with both teams scoreless PERIOD But  into the second period Leivermann added another goal on the weekend giving the Irish the lead PERIOD Unfortunately for the Irish it would be their only goal of the evening PERIOD

Early on in the third the Irish managed to kill a Gopher power play but soon after the Gophers took advantage of a crucial turnover at the blue line and tied the game at one PERIOD Then  into the third McLaughlin added another goal on the weekend off a rebound and the Gophers would hang on to that  lead throughout regulation PERIOD

After the game Jackson said it came down to some crucial mistakes for the Irish PERIOD

We made a blatant turnover to lead to the first goal he said PERIOD It was that and then the penalty obviously went to both goals PERIOD I thought after the second period I felt good about where we were PERIOD We turned the tables on them in the second period and we started the third right away with a bad turnover and then a penalty PERIOD Same thing as last night basically. going forward Jackson said his squad needs to learn to play  minute hockey and maintain that killer instinct throughout the remainder of the season PERIOD

We have to find a way to play  minute hockey games PERIOD Thats where it starts PERIOD Just like Minnesota Minnesota and Michigan are two of the hottest teams in the country in the second half of the year here PERIOD We lost two games to Michigan earlier in the year PERIOD We have to play smart he said PERIOD To me thats the number one thing PERIOD We need to play like a more mature hockey team and thats on me PERIOD Ive been trying to get these guys to understand how they have to play and do it for  minutes PERIOD I thought  in the second game against Wisconsin and then both nights with Penn State  I thought we were turning the corner PERIOD But this weekend I thought there were periods that we played very well and last night I thought we played pretty well for pretty much the whole game PERIOD But in the third period again we gave up the lead PERIOD Instead of trying to get that next goal we do something that leads to a goal against and all of the sudden were on our heels and that happened again tonight PERIOD So for me its just poise and patience and maturity PERIOD  When youve got the lead youve got to play smart PERIOD You cant take penalties you cant make blatant turnovers and you have to make sure you dont give up odd man rushes PERIOD You can still play with a killer instinct and try to score another goal without doing those things. share This Story
