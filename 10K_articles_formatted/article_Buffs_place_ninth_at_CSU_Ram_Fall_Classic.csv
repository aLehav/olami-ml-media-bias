I have been really nervous Doyle said in a news release PERIOD I didnt get any experience last year but I worked a lot in tournaments this summer and I felt ready and a lot less nervous. i think that Ive adjusted well PERIOD So far so good PERIOD

I was a lot more comfortable with what shots I was hitting this round Doyle said.In my first two rounds things werent working together and I would hit a great shot but miss the putt PERIOD Today I hit both the great shots and great putts PERIOD It wasnt that anything changed but instead everything was just working. sophomore Emily Talley led CU with a  total in the twoday tourney to place seventeenth PERIOD Senior Dominique Pytlewski finished one stroke behind Talley PERIOD
