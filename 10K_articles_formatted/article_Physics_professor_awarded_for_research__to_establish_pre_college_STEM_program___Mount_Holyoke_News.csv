Physics professor Kerstin Nordstrom was recently awarded a Cottrell Scholar Award from the Research Corporation for Science Advancement to further her educational and labbased goals specifically her work on granular flows PERIOD

The award is presented to early career faculty at various universities who submit project proposals detailing threeyear research projects PERIOD The proposals must contain the research project as well as an educational component PERIOD The research is reviewed by peers in the field of study while the educational program is evaluated by education specialists PERIOD

Nordstroms lab studies the flow of particles whose movement cant be explained by the laws governing crystallinestructured solids PERIOD

Almost everything we have around us is a disordered material  all of these kinds of materials are usually called soft materials we can easily mechanically deform them she explained PERIOD The weird thing is we dont understand how these materials behave that well PERIOD There are engineers that study specific kinds of materials and come up with rules of thumb for how they behave so they can design systems but theres no good first principles predictive model to understand why they do what they do. this research has applications in physics and also in pedestrian egress blood clot prediction and any other system where large groups of particles are moving through a small opening PERIOD

As for the educational component of her proposal Nordstrom proposed a precollege program which is currently in development PERIOD The basic proposal is to have a short but multiday precollege program for students that dont necessarily have to be interested in being a physics major but they have to have at least some interest in physics or engineering said Nordstrom PERIOD

In the event of multiple candidates we want to try and ensure a very diverse cohort she explained PERIOD During this program they will work oneonone with several faculty members PERIOD Theyll be doing several labbased projects in the afternoons PERIOD In the mornings therell generally be some kind of lecture or skillsoriented workshops like how does one become a scientist how does one navigate college things like that PERIOD The idea is that a lot of people come to college that are interested in STEM but dont know much about it  This is a chance to help them dive in a little bit before college actually starts. nordstrom has been teaching at Mount Holyoke since  when she was appointed a Clare Booth Luce Assistant professor in the physics department PERIOD She teaches various courses in the department and inspires students to pursue physics at the end of her classes PERIOD

Professor Nordstrom taught my Intro Physics class and then she became my advisor when I declared a physics major said Ashley Cavanagh  PERIOD Shes a really great professor  she always went out of her way to make sure everyone in the class was succeeding. tagged Sabrina Edwards Izzy Burgess Kerstin Nordstrom Cottrell Scholar Award
