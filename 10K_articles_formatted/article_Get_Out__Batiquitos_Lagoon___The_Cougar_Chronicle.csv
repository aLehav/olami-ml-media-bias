Nestled between Carlsbad and Encinitas the Batiquitos Lagoon offers home to many birds fish and other wildlife as tides sneak in and out of the lagoon under Interstate  PERIOD

Hikers can often catch a glimpse of many of these critters while meandering the trails and enjoying the fresh air PERIOD

There are many trails to venture out along around the Batiquitos Lagoon but the main trail has its trailhead at the end of Gabbiano Lane PERIOD Thats also where the Nature Center is located PERIOD There is only a handful of parking spots specifically for the lagoon but plenty of street parking is available PERIOD

From the trailhead the trail turns from paved to dirt past the Nature Center but it is well maintained and relatively flat PERIOD A bit down the path the trail begins to run along the Aviara Golf Course but not close enough to have to worry about stray golf balls PERIOD At this point the whoosh of cars from the  dissipates into the chirps of birds sitting in the trees PERIOD The distance from the trailhead to the turnaround is . miles PERIOD

There are other places along the trail that offer access points and parking PERIOD There are no restrooms or water along the trails but there are plenty of benches for resting and observing the wildlife PERIOD More information about the Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation and the Nature Center can be found at www.batiquitosfoundation.org PERIOD
