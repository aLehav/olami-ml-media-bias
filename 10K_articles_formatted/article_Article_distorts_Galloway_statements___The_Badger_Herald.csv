2744,2005-09-20,"last Wednesdays Badger Herald contained three severe distortions of my statements concerning George Galloway an outspoken antiwar member of the British Parliament who recently spoke on the UW campus PERIOD First the article states  This is false PERIOD I stated that I do not necessarily agree with everything Galloway may have said but I made it clear that I fully agree with his strong opposition to the war PERIOD

Second the article states  This too is false PERIOD I stated that this was Scott Suders view of Hussein not mine PERIOD In fact I strongly objected to this characterization of Galloway saying that Suder was using it to discredit him PERIOD

Indeed this is the main thrust of every other interview I have given the evidence for which is contained in a radio interview with Wisconsin Public Radio and an oped piece I wrote to the Capital Times both of which are available on the Havens Center website PERIOD Third the article states  I never made such a statement PERIOD

Instead I stated that in striking contrast to the United States and Britain Galloway has a long history of opposition to Hussein and that he is outraged that those who once supplied Hussein with weapons of mass destruction would denounce him for meeting with Hussein in  as part of an effort to lift sanctions and giving a speech that sounded as though he was praising Hussein PERIOD

I mentioned that Galloway has lived to regret that speech but I took no position of my own on this PERIOD I simply stated what Galloway has said about it without either endorsing it or challenging it PERIOD

To learn my views in my own words as well as those of Scott Suder and George Galloway The Badger Herald readers can find them at the Havens Center website PERIOD
