At the end of a long August of preparation Michigan volleyball coach Mark Rosen was excited to see another team besides his own at Cliff Keen Arena PERIOD

The Wolverines opened the season with their annual Michigan Invitational and rolled to a  start with dominant wins against Saint Louis Miami Ohio and Northern Iowa PERIOD

Michigan began the weekend by hitting . in the first set of Friday nights win against Saint Louis and while the Wolverines didnt reach that level again they were consistent in all three victories dispatching each opponent in roughly  minutes PERIOD

In doing so they took the first step in a season that they hope will bring even more success than last years PERIOD Michigan finished  in  and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament PERIOD A 10match win streak in the nonconference season was critical to that effort before the Wolverines managed to pull out nine wins in a grueling 20match conference slate PERIOD A perfect weekend to start this year could have the same effect PERIOD

I think when youre going in as the favorite it obviously gives you a little bit of confidence but also that can be a teams downfall said sophomore libero Jenna Lerg PERIOD I think a really good thing about this team is that we take that confidence and we use it to our advantage instead of getting cocky and letting loose a little bit like a lot of other teams will. each match was closer than the last from Saint Louis on Friday night    to Miami on Saturday morning    to Northern Iowa on Saturday night    PERIOD That trend reflected the overall results of the tournament where Northern Iowa finished  in the roundrobin tournament followed by Miami and then Saint Louis PERIOD None of the three made the NCAA Tournament last year PERIOD

Playing three matches to start off the season Michigan had the chance to experiment with several different rotations PERIOD Lerg led the team with doubledigit digs in each match but freshman defensive specialist Tiffany Clark and freshman setter MacKenzi Welsh each added  in one of the three PERIOD Senior middle blocker Abby Cole and sophomore outside hitter Carly Skjodt both had doubledigit kills twice led by Coles  against Northern Iowa to close the weekend PERIOD

At setter Welsh began her career with three strong outings totaling  assists PERIOD Sophomore Maddy Abbott added  in the first match to provide a different look PERIOD

Were running a onesetter offense sometimes then were switching into a twosetter offense it was nice to see how that kind of worked said Michigan coach Mark Rosen PERIOD We were also trying some different things defensively and blockingwise and I thought that we were really effective with that. michigan also faced varying looks from its opponents PERIOD Against Northern Iowa for instance the Panthers employed a commit blocking strategy where they trapped the Michigan hitters forcing them to adjust PERIOD

Were expected to win this and we did but it wasnt just by default Cole said PERIOD We had to make changes throughout all three of the matches because this is our first real challenge as a team. in the Northern Iowa match the Wolverines faced the most resistance but they cruised for the better portion of every set PERIOD They only once committed more than six errors in a set while forcing their opponents to do so five times PERIOD On defense they allowed just seven aces on the weekend PERIOD

Michigan has seven freshmen on this years team with Welsh and Clark being the biggest contributors in the first weekend PERIOD Redshirt freshman Cori Crocker who sat out last season also saw her first action and totaled nine kills PERIOD

But they also have the powerful influence of Cole an AllAmerican in  and a fourthyear starter who has played in two NCAA Tournaments PERIOD Michigan received  votes in the first coaches poll of the season ranking thirtieth in the nation PERIOD With one weekend finished the Wolverines now take their first road trip to Manhattan Kan. to try to continue their win streak against Kansas State Georgia Tech and Tennessee State PERIOD

Sometimes when you play at home you feel more pressure because your friends and family are there and its the first time youre putting on a Michigan uniform and youre at Michigan Rosen said PERIOD But I thought they handled it well so now the good thing is weve got that out of the way PERIOD Well go on the road next weekend play on the road and I do think a lot of times emotionally it can be easier playing on the road than at home. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
