The Oklahoma State softball team hasnt ever played at Coors Field and its players havent been swinging for the fences in the crisp Colorado mountain air PERIOD However the team continued its home run surge Tuesday in Stillwater with four Cowgirls sending balls over the outfield wall PERIOD



The  home run total for OSU hitters increased to  nearly tripling the home runs from the last season PERIOD



Despite the offensive display the Cowgirls put on the Creighton University Bluejays  gave the Cowgirls a run for their money Tuesday holding them to close  and  scores in the regional doubleheader PERIOD



Creightons record and statistics are deceiving and OSU coach Margaret Renebar said opposing teams cant judge CUs abilities solely by numbers PERIOD



 she said PERIOD 



In the first game the Cowgirls jumped out to a quick lead when Teresa Ritchie was walked by CUs Shelli Mallegaard PERIOD Ritchie stole second on the next pitch putting her in scoring position PERIOD OSUs next batter second baseman Calli Behmer made her swing count taking the ball over the rightfield wall and scoring Ritchie PERIOD



In the top of the third CUs batters remained aggressive and Stacey Rybar answered with her first home run of the season putting the Bluejays on the scoreboard PERIOD



CU didnt lie down easily and it tied the score in the fourth at  with a Sami Herbster RBI base hit PERIOD



The Cowgirls scored two more runs in the bottom of the fifth when Stephanie Hodges ripped the ball up the middle to score teammates Summer Younk and Jenny Kipp PERIOD



Cami Carter who took the mound for OSU maintained the  lead as she held off CU batters during the final two innings of play PERIOD Carter recorded eight strikeouts and improved to  on the year PERIOD

OSUs fourth run of the game came when CU pitcher Melissa Plog gave a free ticket to Megan Carey allowing pinch runner Amber Annis to walk into home plate PERIOD



Creighton threatened the Cowgirls in the fifth inning scoring two but left runners in scoring position as lefthander Lauren Bay  was able to maintain composure and record her tenth win of the season PERIOD



Bay who fanned  Bluejay hitters is now only  strikeouts shy of moving into sixth place on Oklahoma States list of career strikeouts leaders PERIOD



According to Kipp Creighton wasnt an easy foe for OSU but the Cowgirls used big offensive weapons to ensure two big wins PERIOD
