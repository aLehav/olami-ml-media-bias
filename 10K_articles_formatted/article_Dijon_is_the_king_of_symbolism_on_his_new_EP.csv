Hes everyones favorite secret PERIOD Dijon sits just below the surface on his way to breaking through the underground with shoutouts from acclaimed artists like Brockhampton and a YouTube comments section that spans from youre so underrated it hurts to Dijon could pee into a mic and I would still cry to it lying on my back naked. the YouTube populace has spoken correctly PERIOD Dijons new EP Sci Fi  is the music you cry to preferably stripped down naked while showering in the dark floating freely through the intimacy of his sound yet still bound by the walls of the shower or the walls of heartbreak in a metaphorical sense. dijons personal interest in symbolism inspires yet another allegory in response to his sound Sci Fi  is a flow you want to rock your baby to ensuring that the child grows up with the aptitude for loving Frank Ocean or Miguel PERIOD

Dijons crooning sound stumbles through the sadness of desire and longing navigating a dazed space thats extremely simplistic yet transcendental PERIOD Most gripping however is Dijons symbolic ability allowing for a short threeminute song to take on the rhetorical effect of a fulllength novel PERIOD In an interview with The Fader Dijon explains Theres a pulling apart of American symbolism and ideas  not to sound like a dickhead  theres a human need for these symbols and signifiers as weird abstract representations of humanness PERIOD Thats fascinating. for this reason Sci Fi  elevates itself by addressing heartbreak with unpretentious and unannounced analogies that enables longing in a way that plain fact cannot PERIOD The X factor that makes Frank Ocean fans rock their babies to Dijons sound however is his interrogation of minorities taking on symbols used by predominantly white artists PERIOD Dijon is of Guamanian descent and spent the majority of his childhood moving back and forth between The U.S PERIOD and Germany before attending The University of Maryland PERIOD In a similar manner to Tyler The Creator his RB sound is based partially on tropes of whiteness that otherwise would not be associated with his ethnicity PERIOD

Arguably the most powerful track from the EP Dog Eyes examines the abstract qualities of despondency PERIOD Guitardriven with gaps of white noise Dijons soft hum of a voice ascends from thinking of his intimate other with his eyes as wide red and finally dogeyed PERIOD With a quick trip to PetMd vet authored and vet approved it can be known that dog eyes enable a grainy vision that is a lot less vibrant with more difficulty in differentiating between shades as well as human eyes do PERIOD Moreover dogs see better in low or dim light as compared to humans PERIOD Personally the inescapable ache and yearning for a lost vibrancy becomes more tangible to me when navigated through the lens of a dogs vision and lyrics like A sea of grey and black around you I get dog eyes when I think about you come to life PERIOD The imagery of a dogs glossed over eyes is a feeling the heartbroken didnt even know they needed as it animates walking through shades of gray and black PERIOD

Paired with his abstract inclinations Dijon masterfully plays into the use of personal sorrows that in actuality are extremely universal PERIOD Everyone and their mother seems to remember a teenage summertime which Dijon grasps in his single Cannonball. cannonball complements the melancholy of Dog Eyes by stumbling into the space of a sensual ache PERIOD His analogies to cannonballs in the pool add undercurrents of comingofage to a song that otherwise searches for physical gratification PERIOD Paired with his upper range and the surges of aggression that disrupt the gentle guitar the summertime breeze shivers down your spine PERIOD

If Frank Ocean holds your heart it is absolutely critical to give Dijon a listen PERIOD Not to be misinterpreted his creativity and artistry lands him his own personal lane separate from that of Ocean but its as if hes Oceans second cousin PERIOD And who wouldnt want to cry laying on their back naked in the shower to that crooning intimate sound
