8831,2023-11-05,"the summer is officially in full swing and this year looks a little different from past years PERIOD Georgia State students have used their quarantine freetime to delve into new crafts PERIOD

Junior Geavonna Starr has been working on a novel tentatively titled The Network. the novel is crime fiction set in a world where the Hollywood entertainment industry serves as a front for organized crime PERIOD Starr said the storyline is reminiscent of Quentin Tarantinos crime film True Romance. starr has always been entranced with words PERIOD As a kid she would rent out the maximum number of  books from the library PERIOD With the temporary hold on outsidelife Starr has been able to focus on her writing projects PERIOD

She especially appreciates having time to study other forms of media to draw inspiration for her work PERIOD She cites the Robbers music video by The  as her alltime favorite music video PERIOD She also gets inspiration from the outlaws and gangsters featured in video games like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. being able to watch movies play video games and listen to music inspires me Starr said PERIOD It helps me create the content develop the plot and develop the characters. starr appreciates the infinite amount of time she has due to the open timeline of quarantinelife PERIOD She views it as a form of meditation PERIOD

Writing is kind of a lot of pressure but being able to do a personal project takes the anxiety away Starr said PERIOD

For her writing is worthwhile because it serves as an outlet for personal expression however Starr also believes it can be a difficult process PERIOD

If you struggle with perfectionism thats a really difficult thing because its very hard to get any writing done at all when youre obsessing over whether or not its going to be good enough PERIOD Not just for other people but for yourself Starr said PERIOD Im my own worst critic. senior Malik Galbraith has used his time stuck at home to focus on state and nationwide interests PERIOD

As the spring semester came to a close Galbraith created a multipage Excel spreadsheet tracking several elections including the Georgia Senate and the Georgia 1st14th Congressional District elections PERIOD He checks for new polling information daily mainly using FiveThirtyEight to gather information PERIOD

He was inspired by West Wing a political drama PERIOD In the show the characters knew specific politicians and elections a skill that appealed to him PERIOD

As a political science major Galbraith has a knack for politics PERIOD After graduation he aims to work for Congressional campaigns in Washington D.C PERIOD

For now his focus is close to home PERIOD As Galbraith tracks Georgias elections the state has become a potential battleground for the presidential election. galbraith cites the shift in Georgias voting trends the once Republican state has begun to lean towards politically moderate PERIOD

As the national and local elections arrive Galbraith hopes that voters commit to submitting their votes PERIOD While he congratulates the younger generation for its focus on advocacy and onlineoutreach he emphasizes the importance of voting PERIOD

I think that its becoming more apparent with all the recent events that young people need to get out and vote if we want to change the world we live in Galbraith said PERIOD The local elections will really impact your life PERIOD If you really want to see change you have to vote with knowledge. he also hopes that the recent protests for equality will encourage more voters to hit the polls PERIOD

Junior Jaylan Scott also has a knack for politics and especially since quarantine has added DJ to his resume PERIOD

As classes went online Scott found himself with extra free time PERIOD While surfing Youtube Scott watched a video which advised him to not cheap out on your hobby. this message led to Scott investing in a  DJ set PERIOD

Scott started listening to electronic music three years ago and began studying the unfamiliar art by watching DJ sets filmed at music festivals PERIOD Now he finds himself mimicking the artists movements as he watches their videos PERIOD

A few months ago Scott created a DJ Instagram page under the alias Governor meant to combine his two callings PERIOD

Scott uses his craft to destress and sometimes he envisions life as a musician and professional mixer PERIOD

The significance of the DJ controller is just for me to dig into my passion and me loving the music Scott said PERIOD I told myself that when I retire one day Im going to travel the world and become a worldwide DJ. scott currently holds positions with multiple political organizations including the Young Democrats of Georgia and Southern Majority PERIOD Like Galbraith Scott isnt ready to let passivevoters off the hook PERIOD

Your vote is the first step whereas getting people elected and holding them accountable is the next step Scott said PERIOD Politicians do what they want until you hold them accountable PERIOD I really want voters to feel like their voices are heard but at the same time I want them to know the civic value of what it takes to get stuff done. amidst COVID19 students are creating different realities or theyre tracking the current one all from their living rooms PERIOD Once Georgia States campus reopens its doors students will return with a new party trick or even a new career PERIOD
