Whenever my friends try to convince me to watch a movie like  or  I almost always refuse PERIOD

I inevitably think of the night I saw 

After seeing a midnight showing in Omaha my roommate and I came back to our dorm finished up our homework and went to sleep  or at least tried to PERIOD

I spent almost the entire night periodically looking over at her to make sure she wasnt possessed ready to leap over and kill me PERIOD

Luckily I finally passed out in the wee hours of the morning and the next day she admitted doing the exact same thing with me PERIOD

The horror movie genre is definitely something people either love or hate PERIOD

Some completely abhor horror movies and avoid them at any cost others cant get enough often renting the entire Blockbuster collection to get their fix PERIOD

Until recently I was wholly on the side against them PERIOD

I didnt enjoy watching almost any horror movie PERIOD

I didnt get how anyone could enjoy being scared disgusted or any of the various feelings one could get and I certainly didnt get why people keep making them in abundance PERIOD

My main issue with horror flicks is that most only have one purpose to either scare or horrify you PERIOD

Many of them from what I gather dont have good plots interesting characters or even actors who can actually act so why would I want to see it

A movie should at least have a character to like or sympathize with or an engaging plot with more than just some cheap thrills PERIOD

Which brings me to the other issue I have Why would a person want to be scared in the first place

Or disgusted

If I want to be distressed I can just pick up the newspaper or turn the TV to Fox News PERIOD

Fear seems like an emotion most would want to run away from not welcome PERIOD

So why watch horror Why rent DVD after DVD of this madness

One reason Stephen King discusses in his Playboy article  is that our negative emotions need to be exercised PERIOD

When people display positive emotions theyre rewarded even applauded PERIOD

If one wishes to display a negative emotion or act in a way that isnt deemed  theyre locked up or scorned PERIOD

According to King horror movies are a safe way to exercise these instincts and feelings and not be punished PERIOD

Although I dont generally like horror movies I do agree with him on that point PERIOD

Sooner or later we all become curious about something we havent experienced before or dont experience often including certain emotions PERIOD

I could have chosen not to see  with my friends a few years ago but I was definitely curious about how I would react PERIOD

Another trend Ive noticed among horror movie fans is that they like to watch horror because they want to prove they can see it through to the end and explore their boundaries PERIOD

Seeing the entirety of  or  for example is similar to running a gauntlet PERIOD

If you make it to the end of a horror film unscathed youre the bravest of the brave if you cant sleep for a week afterward like me or youre afraid to take a shower youre a baby PERIOD

Horror movies also tend to provoke intense feelings from their audiences which is necessary for a good movie experience PERIOD

Some of my favorite films were ones that kept me on the edge of my seat and never let me go until the ending credits PERIOD

If a film doesnt trigger a substantial reaction whats the point

If youre not going to be thinking about it five minutes later you probably shouldnt have watched it at all PERIOD

In light of all of these reasons I would say I havent given horror movies much of a fair chance PERIOD

Ive always thought I disliked them because they seem to be terribly made but maybe there are more underlying reasons PERIOD

If what King says is correct then perhaps I dont want to exercise my negative emotions or Im afraid of them PERIOD

And admittedly I do think I take some of the imagery and storylines too seriously PERIOD

Deep down I know I probably wont be mowed down by a serial killer with a chainsaw or be possessed by an otherworldly demon but thats rather difficult to keep in mind when its blown up on a big screen in front of me PERIOD

Either way I still dont enjoy horror and I dont think I ever truly will but Ive become slightly more open to seeing them PERIOD

Sometimes its OK to be a little stressed when watching a movie because if I dont mind watching movies that make me cry or worry about the world we live in I can certainly try one that makes me scared shitless PERIOD
