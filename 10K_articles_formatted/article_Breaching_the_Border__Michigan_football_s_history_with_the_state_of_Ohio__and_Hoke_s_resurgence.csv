One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

CINCINNATI  Its just past dawn on a day in early August here though this scene could be found anywhere in this state other big cities such as Columbus or Cleveland smaller suburbs such as Pickerington or Lakewood quainter towns like Findlay PERIOD

A group of  and 17yearolds find themselves trudging across a vast grass field PERIOD The sun is beginning to peek through the clouds and it is at the same time glorious and foreboding PERIOD Glorious because the rays soften the gloominess of the long arduous day set before these teenagers foreboding because the rays also promise misery once morning recedes into afternoon and the August heat begins to stifle them once again PERIOD

For young men to be awake this early on a late summer morning  the last days of freedom before the school year seizes their lives for nine more months again  they have to be either insane or they have to be football players PERIOD

These are the latter PERIOD

The same routine unfolds in every state across this country which values its football as dearly as it does its freedoms PERIOD But theres something different about football in Ohio PERIOD

It might not be a way of life here but its a big part of life PERIOD Communities are centered around high school football teams coaches are scrutinized as if they were coaching professionals players engulf themselves in the sport PERIOD The state of Ohio is a football hotbed and the talent that grows here and the intensity that envelops communities speak to that PERIOD It is without a doubt the locus of Midwestern football PERIOD

Brady Hoke knows all about Ohio high school football PERIOD Hes recruited the state almost his whole coaching career which has most recently brought him to the head coaching position at Michigan PERIOD

But Hoke also grew up here PERIOD He saw the fervor firsthand as a linebacker and center and senior captain for Fairmont East High School in Kettering a suburb of Dayton PERIOD

The passion permeates the state PERIOD

Friday nights in Ohio are kind of important Hoke said PERIOD


Horace G PERIOD Prettyman arrived at the University of Michigan in  PERIOD He came from Bryan Ohio a town in the northwest part of the state thats closer to the Indiana border than it is to Toledo the nearest major Ohio city PERIOD

A forward for each of the next four years Prettyman was the first Ohioan to play on the Michigan football team three years after the firstever group of Wolverines played their inagural game PERIOD He was joined by other Buckeye State natives beginning in  and soon the quality of these Ohioans skyrocketed PERIOD

Pontius Miller from Circleville was the first Ohiobred football player to become an AllAmerican at Michigan as a tackle in  PERIOD The next decade saw four of his peers accomplish the same including Benny Friedman one of the most prolific quarterbacks in school history PERIOD

Men like Prettyman and Miller couldnt have known it at the time but they established a legacy that has been central to the storied tradition of Michigan football dependence on players who hail from Ohio PERIOD

Its always been part of Michigans recruiting Hoke said PERIOD We have two Heisman winners from the state of Ohio. they are Desmond Howard and Charles Woodson PERIOD Hoke went on to name other luminaries hailing from the state including Bo Schembechler Jerry Hanlon and Gary Moeller PERIOD

Its a big part of it PERIOD Youve got a state thats got great coaching very passionate about the game of football Hoke said PERIOD

To put it bluntly Michigans alltime success could not have happened without Ohioborn players PERIOD The state of Michigan produces some highquality players but not enough to fully support a dominant program PERIOD

Ohio on the other hand produces enough players to supply multiple programs and it has PERIOD

Recent Ohioborn Wolverines include players such as Mario Manningham and Shawn Crable PERIOD Redshirt junior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint and fifthyear senior safety Jordan Kovacs are two of the more prominent names on Team  who hail from the state PERIOD

All told Michigan has had  separate players earn AllAmerica distinction PERIOD Twentyone of them or about  percent have been from Ohio PERIOD

Twelve of those  AllAmericans have come in the last  years dating from when Ohio native Schembechler assumed control of the Wolverines PERIOD The Ohio flavor has been more pronounced ever since PERIOD

And its only gotten stronger under Hoke PERIOD



When Hoke was hired by Michigan in January  he and his staff made clear that recruiting the state of Ohio would be an emphasis PERIOD

Obviously being the state right next door like it is its a high priority said linebackers coach Mark Smith PERIOD And from the standpoint of the quality of the football thats produced in Ohio youd be stupid not to go in the state of Ohio. hoke was thrown into the fire recruitingwise due to the timing of his hire with National Signing Day less than a month away PERIOD After making sure the recruits who had already committed to Michigan under former coach Rich Rodriguez would be retained Hoke went to work on adding more players including four Ohioans  defensive end Keith Heitzman linebacker Antonio Poole defensive end Frank Clark and sincedeparted cornerback Tamani Carter PERIOD

But Hokes recruiting genius in his native state fully emerged in recruiting the class of  his first full group with the Wolverines PERIOD

All told he signed nine players from Ohio including one fivestar offensive tackle Kyle Kalis and four fourstars according to Rivals.coms rankings PERIOD Three of them  linebacker Joe Bolden from Cincinnati Colerain safety Jarrod Wilson from Akron Buchtel and tight end A.J PERIOD Williams from Cincinnati Sycamore  saw playing time in Michigans season opener against Alabama last Saturday PERIOD

For the class of  Hoke has already secured nine more Ohioans including six fourstar players PERIOD

Simply put no previous Michigan coach  at least recently  has done better in Ohio than Hoke has so far PERIOD

In his two full classes Hoke has landed  players from the state with a star average of . according to Rivals PERIOD By comparison Rich Rodriguez signed  Ohioans in his two full classes as Michigan head coach with a star average of . pERIOD And in Lloyd Carrs final six full recruiting classes from  the Wolverines signed just  players from Ohio albeit with a . star average PERIOD

I think that its a combination of Michigan being a highprofile school in the Midwest and Brady Hoke putting a focal point on the state of Ohio said Rivals.com Midwest Analyst Josh Helmoldt PERIOD Its come together and allowed them to really make a strong dent in the top talent for that state. hokes efforts are especially notable when compared to his predecessors PERIOD As the numbers indicate Rodriguez recruited Ohio strongly PERIOD But he focused just as much on Florida where his staff had ties and where he had recruited in the past PERIOD

Rodriguez emphasized Florida as much as Hokes staff emphasizes the Midwest PERIOD

The current staff has four assistants specifically assigned to Ohio PERIOD Smith and defensive coordinator Greg Mattison focus on the major hotbeds  the southwest section around Cincinnati and Dayton and the northeast section around Cleveland respectively PERIOD Offensive coordinator Al Borges and defensive line coach Jerry Montgomery also help out PERIOD

Rodriguez meanwhile had four coaches assigned to Florida PERIOD While that state produces even more talent than Ohio the competition is greater with three instate powers  Florida Florida State and Miami  and the rest of the South also making a concerted effort to recruit there PERIOD

It was like Rodriguez was searching for a fountain of youth in Florida PERIOD Hoke meanwhile has already begun mining the Potosi that sits next door PERIOD

Youre just kind of getting who you can when you can in Florida Helmholdt said PERIOD I think when youre looking at building a class which involves both getting talent and also addressing needs you are able to accomplish that much better when you start with securing your needs at home and in the Midwest. but what of the elephant in the room the power that sits in the middle of the state and has traditionally had its pick of the surrounding talent

Its no wonder Ohio State is one of the top programs in college football PERIOD It has an unending supply of top high school football players a short distance away and many of them grow up dreaming of wearing the scarlet and gray PERIOD

Michigan then has always found itself fighting an uphill battle in trying to recruit the state of its biggest rival PERIOD On the face of it its a bit silly that the Wolverines would invest so much time effort and money in what is essentially enemy territory PERIOD Realistically Michigan will never outrecruit Ohio State in Ohio PERIOD

But that doesnt mean that the Wolverines cant pick up at least a few solid prospects every year  or do even better as has been the case under Hoke PERIOD

Ohio State cant get them all said Mentor High School coach Steve Trivisonno the coach of  defensive lineman recruit Tom Strobel PERIOD

Plus fewer Ohio recruits than expected grow up diehard Buckeye fans PERIOD

Current Ohionative Michigan players such as redshirt sophomore linebacker Jake Ryan fifthyear senior offensive lineman Patrick Omameh and fifthyear senior tight end Brandon Moore for example all said that they didnt grow up rooting strongly for Ohio State PERIOD

Hoke was helped too in the  class by the tattoomemorabilia scandal that hit Columbus and eventually forced the resignation of former coach Jim Tressel PERIOD The uncertainty surrounding the Ohio State program caused several recruits to rethink their plans PERIOD

Kalis and Strobel for example both were Ohio State fans and they have said they likely never wouldve considered Michigan were it not for the doubts that arose concerning the Buckeyes PERIOD Kalis in fact was initially committed to the Buckeyes PERIOD But each decided to look at the Wolverines in the wake of Ohio States issues PERIOD

That pair and the other Ohio recruits have been sold on Michigan because of the way that Hoke and his staff operate PERIOD

Really down to earth said Sycamore High School coach Scott Dattilo who coached Williams PERIOD Thats the one thing about Coach Hoke that jumped out PERIOD Ive known Coach Smith for a while very easy to talk to him but Coach Hokes just a downtoearth guy PERIOD I can see why kids would be drawn to him PERIOD Doesnt come off as holierthanthou head coach PERIOD

Just one of the guys that comes in and talks football and I think thats an appealing trait. the coaching staff including Mattison  who has a reputation for being one of the best recruiters in all of college football  knows Ohio well and it doesnt put on any pretenses when it recruits there PERIOD Genuineness is what most recruits point to when asked about the Michigan coaches according to Helmholdt PERIOD

Dymonte Thomas a safetyrunning back from Marlington High School in Alliance who is committed to Michigan for  even said that Mattison is pretty much like another dad for me. its that comfort level that Ohio recruits have found with Hoke and company that has spurred the staffs recent recruiting successes PERIOD Theyve landed seven players with offers from Ohio State Rodriguez had none and Carr had just four in his last six full classes PERIOD

Like Thomas Pickerington North High School tight end Jake Butt another  commit said he thought hed never go to Michigan before Hokes staff began recruiting him PERIOD

After visiting for the Ohio State game the MichiganNotre Dame game getting to see games like that it really just got my heart into Michigan Butt said PERIOD You know what It wasnt even hard at all to pick Ohio States biggest rival. unsurprisingly Thomas and others have heard it from their friends and other locals all of whom chide them for going to That School Up North PERIOD But that has done nothing to sway them PERIOD

I still feel great about it Thomas said PERIOD



Its easy to find stats that show how strong of a state Ohio is footballwise PERIOD In Rivals.coms national high school rankings only Florida Texas and Georgia have more than the four teams that Ohio boasts in the top  PERIOD

According to ProFootballReference.com Ohio is tied with Georgia for having produced the fourthmost amount of players currently in the NFL PERIOD

Its more difficult to put your finger on why Ohio is so good at football PERIOD

Sure theres population  its the seventhlargest state in the country by that measure PERIOD But New York Illinois and Pennsylvania all have bigger populations and none match Ohios football prowess though Pennsylvania nearly does PERIOD Michigan and North Carolina come close to Ohios population figure but they dont hold a candle to the quality of Ohios football either PERIOD

When you talk to high school coaches  the ones who see the interest more acutely than anyone else who feel the pressure more strongly than anyone else  you find that even they dont have a firm answer PERIOD

The only possible explanation is passion PERIOD

When you go to a game theres  people in the stands Trivisonno said PERIOD Its a tougher state bluecollar state that people work hard at and enjoy football love football PERIOD Theres great tradition obviously with the Hall of Fame and all that PERIOD

I just think its a state that loves the game of football. as Hoke said Friday nights matter in Ohio think Friday Night Lights but without the overthetopcraziness that apparently permeates the culture in Texas PERIOD

That passion manifests itself in one of the best concentrations of talent in the U.S. in some of the most diligent and determined coaches in the country and in a visceral almost indefinable tie between communities and teams PERIOD

In some ways the history of Michigan football is the history of an Ohio foundation PERIOD That foundation includes two of three Heisman winners two of the previous four head coaches  including the most iconic  and some of the best players in Wolverine history PERIOD

That foundation includes Brady Hoke and his focus on his home state of Ohio  a focus that has yielded results unmatched in recent years PERIOD And theres no reason to believe the run in Ohio wont continue PERIOD
