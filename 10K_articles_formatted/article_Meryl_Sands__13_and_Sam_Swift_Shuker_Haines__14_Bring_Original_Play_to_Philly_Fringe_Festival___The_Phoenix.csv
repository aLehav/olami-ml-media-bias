Meryl Sands  and Sam Swift ShukerHaines  debuted their play XY Scheherezade a production by their new theater company Unstuck Theater in the Philly Fringe Festival that ran from the 19to the  of September PERIOD The play written and performed by ShukerHaines and directed and produced by Sands looks at the nuances of the end of the world through the lens of the story of Scheherezade from the Arabian Nights PERIOD

Unstuck Theater was founded by Sands and ShukerHaines in Swarthmore last year PERIOD It explores the moment in storytelling where fiction and reality blend and create collaboratively created pieces of nonlinear socially conscious theater. www.unstucktheater.comaboutc10fk Their inaugural production was Unstuck Sands senior thesis that was performed last spring in the Freer theater PERIOD Madeline Charne  also a part of Unstuck Theater served as dramaturge and a producer for XY Scheherazade PERIOD

XY Scheherazade the companys second production was conceived by ShukerHaines after the two lost the rights to the piece they had planned to showcase at the Fringe Festival which wasAn Illiad by Dennis OHare PERIOD The troupe had to quickly come up with an alternative PERIOD

We had literally one day to give them a title and a fifty word description and go Swift said PERIOD So we did PERIOD I wanted to do a story and a play about the Arabian nights PERIOD I thought about the Scheherezade story and the structure of  stories a different one each night PERIOD We also knew we wanted to be using my own life PERIOD Which is where XY came from  Im gender queer and we were talking about the end of the world and thinking about myself at the end of the world and what it means to be trans at the end of the world. the protagonist of the play Grace is a trans woman but Sands explained that this play treats Grace differently than other portrayals of trans characters PERIOD

The play isnt about her being a trans womanshe is a trans women she said PERIOD Shes a fully developed person and the play is very much about her in a room with a bunch of other peoplethe audienceas an attempt to have them see each other as people PERIOD Unfortunately it is revolutionaryto have a character who is a trans woman and to have a play that isnt about that PERIOD Its about other things ShukerHaines gave a solo performance playing all three characters Grace her friend Sam and the Rat an embodiment of evil PERIOD

The play begins with ShukerHaines washing each audience members hands with dirt a welcoming process with a whole slew of symbolic meaning PERIOD It can mean so many different things said Sands And its not for me to say what that meansthats not my job PERIOD As an artist I present the question. the interactive intimate moment that literally dirties the hands of each audience member sets the tone for a showand a theater companythat examine where storytelling and reality meet and what happens between people when they are both audience and performers PERIOD

ShukerHaines and Sands blend their themesthe apocalypse and Arabian Nightsby weaving together different storiesmany of which are autobiographical for Swiftand look at different interpretations of the world ending PERIOD The central story is one of sexual assault PERIOD

We start with an end of the world which is beautiful judgment free there is no one to get in my way no one to tell me what to dothis infinite freedom said ShukerHaines PERIOD Then the beauty gets corrupted and destroyed by the reality of the end of the worldwhat the reality would actually be like PERIOD It would end or go towards a place where I was kidnapped. in the play Grace is kidnapped by a band of roving marauders and must tell stories to stay alive PERIOD It ends in this cascade of stories they said stories within stories within stories. for both collaborators the connection between a sexual assault story and the end of the world is significant PERIOD The inherent violence of acquaintance rape is hard to understand because often the assailant is a very nice person Sands said PERIOD Our protagonist Grace really deals with that because it just doesnt make sense that someone so nice could do something so terrible PERIOD Its very difficult to process and you think that the world must be ending. while in art the world can end in reality the world keeps turning in the face of suffering and trauma PERIOD

The world has a terrible habit of failing to end when it just ought to Sands said PERIOD It can be hard to realize that the world does not care about the huge amount of painit just keeps going in the face of all of it PERIOD Which is in some ways terrible but in other ways is really beautiful that in spite of all the pain that we as humans have to deal with in our lives and that the world still suffers PERIOD People still love people still create there is still joy there are still connections intimacy is still possibleand thats what we get to at the end of the playthat there is still beauty regardless of the fact that things can be really awful. performing the intensely personal show eight times in a fourday period was both emotionally exhausting and exhilarating for Swift PERIOD Once the show got started it had a life of its own they said PERIOD The play was happening through meI wasnt really doing it. and the audience responded to this passion At the end I tried to get the entire audience yelling things and they did they said PERIOD The response was really touching and I felt like I had done something. of course ShukerHaines and Sands are no strangers to bold innovative theater as theater majors at Swarthmore each has acted written and directed shows that push the boundaries of story telling and audienceactor connection PERIOD For Swift this audienceactor relationship is what makes theater their art form of choice PERIOD

One of the major artistic ideas that I am interested in is the intimate interaction between audience and artist they said PERIOD I think that theater performance as a medium has a really beautiful possibility for connection because it is a person in front of you doing something and what you are watching which is different than musicis the thing that is being created PERIOD You are watching the person themselves in their vulnerability with all of their idiosyncrasies the tiny accidental things that make them human thats the art PERIOD By watching it you allow it to exist. for Meryl it took a long time to decide on a theater major and in the end it was her future collaborator Swift who helped her make the decision PERIOD After starting at Haverford College which does not have a theater department Sands took a theater class at Swarthmore and eventually transferred PERIOD I still wasnt sure until I met Swift PERIOD I met Swift in an acting class in my first semester at Swarthmorewhich was also their first semester at Swarthmore. the two first collaborated when Swift cast Meryl as one of the leads in the play The Body You See in the Mirror PERIOD Something about that play and the community we formedwe were really making art and it was so personal and so important Meryl said PERIOD That experience solidified my feeling that that was what I needed to do. neither Sands nor ShukerHanies knows for sure what is next for Unstuck Theater but would potentially restage the show if they find the funding PERIOD For now Sands is working at Green Mountain Energy selling renewable energy for peoples homes and exploring the Philly Theater Scene and other theatrical opportunities PERIOD

She compared her current life to the chance involved in creating theater Im leaping into life and hoping it catches me. meanwhile ShukerHaines has their senior company show and directing thesis at Swarthmore PERIOD It is possible that Unstuck Theater will stage ShukerHaines composition at the next Philly Fringe Festival PERIOD In the words of Sands It would be nice to see the future but I think that would ruin the surprise. your email address will not be published PERIOD
