Green Nineteen. green Nineteen go

Aaron Rodgers cadence pre snap PERIOD

Hows everybodys week going Really appreciate everyone who read The Great Debate blog published two weeks ago PERIOD Thanks for all the feedback Good fun good fun PERIOD

Well now PERIOD What to write about to follow that work of art Well I think the answer to this is obvious Cue Jock Jams  cassette tape PERIOD Its time to preview this Thursday nights Intramural Flag Football Game of the Week PERIOD This weeks matchup has been compared to Manning vs Brady Ali vs Frazier and Woodbury Central vs St PERIOD Marys just to name a few PERIOD I know ESPN has been all over the coverage of this game but for those of you that live under a rock Im talking about the Intramural Flag Football Flint Michigan Mega Bowl Say that  times fast For those of you that actually did this Im thrilled to have you reading my blog PERIOD This game is between dirty mike and the boys led by Michael Kaufmann and yes their team name is not capitalized because Mike cant find the shift button as a senior in college and the Ballers by Tradition squad lead by newly elected captain Kyle Weeden no relation to pro football superstar Brandon Weeden PERIOD These two squads might not be the most talented or even the best teams in BVs flag football league but on Thurday night both teams will be reaching for the same goal The Intramural Flag Football Flint Michigan Mega Bowl PERIOD

I cannot take full credit for the rest of this article PERIOD Instead I copied and pasted this official game preview from intramuralpreps.com although I could not find the authors name PERIOD

dirty mike and the boys at Ballers by Tradition2. at J PERIOD Leslie Rollins Stadium under the lights

Game Preview
This is a game my grandchildrens grandchildren will tell stories about. bold words from the press conference with Ballers by Tradition captain Kyle Weeden whose team boasts a record of  with three forfeits this season PERIOD Weeden a junior tight end and linebacker for the club recently took the team under his wing while impeaching Grady Gallagher the captain coach and best looking player at the time PERIOD

Grady just aint gettin it done PERIOD It was time for us to put some brains on the job comments Weeden current . gPA about the decision PERIOD

While critics and stockholders everywhere absolutely hated the decision at first Weeden boasts a one game win streak at the moment with recent success stories emerging in Paul Gallagher true Freshman WR and Connor Grupe redshirt Senior QB PERIOD

You know were riding high right now and really havent stopped celebrating since we won last Thursday PERIOD In fact no players showed up for practice Friday Saturday Sunday or Monday including me says the confident Weeden PERIOD

Although there is no lack of confidence across the pond dirty mike and the boys are taking this game the Intramural Flag Football Flint Michigan Mega Bowl just as seriously PERIOD

I actually wont be playing in the game Thursday PERIOD Theres a catpetting convention up in Minneapolis that night PERIOD I have no further comments on the matter PERIOD God bless said Kaufmann at the press conference after Mondays practice PERIOD

Fortunately Sam Lipps stuck around to comment about the matchup PERIOD

Well miss Kauf for sure PERIOD Hes nearly irreplaceable PERIOD I mean he brings us water cups at every stoppage PERIOD How do you replace that said Lipps PERIOD

Well be ready to play PERIOD Weve been studying a lot of Iowa State game film PERIOD We think were similar clubs and we learn a lot from watching one another PERIOD As far as Im concerned we are Cyclone Nation. when asked what the Mega Bowl meant to him Lipps was quick to respond PERIOD

I mean this is everything PERIOD Its like on the Sandlot when theyre trying to get the ball back from the dog PERIOD This game is like that PERIOD Its that important. the only hint of doubt that came from Lipps in the interview was when he learned that Cole Darrow and Alex Savage might actually play in the Mega Bowl while both have been listed Doubtful each game due to Lack of Heart. ya know those two really dont worry me PERIOD Its like youre telling me that Nate Burleson and Ryan Broyles are playing for the Lions this weekend I really dont care PERIOD Like seriously get out of my face PERIOD I dont care but you tell me that Calvin Johnson is going to play thats when my stomach churns a bit PERIOD I think on this team Heitkamp is that guy PERIOD

If there is one thing you can expect from this game it will be well officiated PERIOD

After Weeden guaranteed a  point victory in the press conference he had one more thing to add PERIOD

I cant wait to sign autographs and sell them for high profits after we win this game. cancel reply
