2513,2023-11-04,"this past weekend the Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability sponsored the Naturally Illinois Expo PERIOD The event took place at and around the Natural Resources Building PERIOD

On Friday the grounds were swamped with field trips from neighboring schools PERIOD There was a record  students who attended this year PERIOD Last year only  students attended PERIOD

The exposition featured  exhibits demonstrations and handson activities for the public PERIOD Exhibits focused on inspiring children to explore the natural sciences by allowing them to see that science can be fun PERIOD The variety of exhibits presented by the five collaborating Illinois surveys  Natural History Survey Geological Survey Archeological Survey Water Survey and the Sustainable Technology Center  aimed to demonstrate the important role that science plays in the everyday lives of the community and the state PERIOD

The exhibits and exciting demonstrations preached the importance of eliminating Americas excessive waste patterns and the conservation of wildlife and natural resources PERIOD

With more technological advances in todays society Joy Scrogum representative of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center said there is a growing amount of waste that the public is completely unaware of PERIOD



I think things like the Naturally Illinois Expo are very important because we get young children in and get them to see that science can be fun and exciting gets them to think about things in our everyday lives like disposing of electronic devices in our exhibit that they might not think about Scrogum said PERIOD

A number of new exhibits were highlighted this year PERIOD Earthquakes Now and Then featured realtime seismometer displays PERIOD The exhibit was relevant due to the recent detrimental earthquake in Japan PERIOD In fact the seismometer on campus was able to detect the earthquake in Japan by measuring the swaying of the building PERIOD

The focus of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center is to develop innovative systems that improve efficiency and protect the environment PERIOD The new Biomass to Biofuels and Biocar exhibit exemplified their ideal by explaining the process of converting waste fat and oils into energy PERIOD They explained that currently the Illinois Biodiesel Initiative is working diligently to convert all the vegetable oils used in dining halls into biodiesel to be used in garages and carpools on campus PERIOD

This year the Kids Fossil Dig included an accurate display of an excavation as well as a prehistoric trash pit which gave children a handson opportunity to see the kinds of things that geologists do when they work in the field PERIOD

It is a great way for them to do a lot of handson things and part of it I think is just being on campus and getting to see the range of natural sciences Jill Thomas a parent chaperone with Robinson Elementary fourth and fifthgrade classes said PERIOD

Libby Johnston communications director for the Institute of Natural Resources said the collaboration of the five surveys informed the public about preserving natural resources PERIOD

One of the things we are really hoping to do is to help the public understand the value that the institute brings to the state of Illinois Johnston said PERIOD","Naturally Illinois Expo Draws over 1,700 Students - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
