Despite its name sounding as if it belonged to a European metal outfit Centralia Massacre hopes that above all else we fall more into the folk category. no this is not some strange metalfolk hybrid just a folkbluegrass band with an amusing name PERIOD Formed in Knoxville in  the band incorporates elements of folk jazz oldcountry and blues said guitarist Laura Bost PERIOD Other members are James Maples on banjo and guitar the other founding member of the band along with Bost upright bassist Johnny Walker and drummer Steve Corrigan PERIOD All members are University of Tennessee alumni PERIOD

We enjoy being Knoxville musicians. bost said PERIOD We are proud of the growing folk community here and our fellow hometown musicians. the band has been compared to Over the Rhine and The Everybodyfields Bost said PERIOD However on some tracks a listener might also hear vocals reminiscent of indie rock or a harmonica that sounds straight out of the Adventures of Pete  Pete soundtrack PERIOD
