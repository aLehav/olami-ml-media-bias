My Opinion

What must the Penn State womens soccer team do to pry its way into the hearts of pollsters Or for that matter just gain the recognition it deserves

Although the teams season ended last Friday night with a  loss at No PERIOD  North Carolina erasing its dreams of a national championship this year the Nittany Lions deserve to be part of the Final Four in Dallas just as much as the other teams PERIOD

Even North Carolina womens soccer coach Anson Dorrance has said that the caliber of the Penn State program is that of a Final Four team PERIOD

And yet the team wont be going to Dallas this weekend PERIOD Although that fact cant change it should at least be recognized that the Lions could hold their own against North Carolina Portland Santa Clara or Florida PERIOD

Penn State has been solid all season ending with a  record PERIOD Even when key defenders Leigh Hamilton and Megan Mills were injured during the Iowa game on Oct PERIOD  the Lions depth on the bench kept them in the game PERIOD In fact the bench has been a key to the Penn State team all season PERIOD All but one player a freshman goalkeeper has seen action PERIOD

And lets not forget the other key players on the team PERIOD Junior forward Christie Welsh is second in the nation in scoring with  goals Floridas Abby Wambach leads with  PERIOD Welsh is also tied for first in assists with  PERIOD She has been a force to be reckoned with all season for the Lions PERIOD And her efforts paid off PERIOD Welsh was named the Big Ten Player of the Year for the third season in a row and on Tuesday was named the winner of the  Hermann Trophy the equivalent to the Heisman Trophy in college football PERIOD Welsh was a candidate for the award last year and could just as easily become the recipient next year PERIOD

Were also talking about the player who participated with the U.S PERIOD National Team in the Algarve Cup in Portugal in March of this year and was a member of the U.S PERIOD Under21 Team in Mexico in May and Norway in July PERIOD She is also the player who will forgo her spring semester at Penn State next year to try and join the professional ranks of the WUSA PERIOD

But Welsh isnt the only player that can and will go pro PERIOD

While he wouldnt name names former Penn State womens soccer coach Pat Farmer current coach of the WUSAs N.Y PERIOD Power said in a phone interview this week that he can see five or six players on the Penn State team that could possibly go to the big leagues in the future PERIOD

Now that their collegiate careers are over senior goalkeeper Emily Oleksiuk and senior defenders Bonnie Young and Megan Mills all have the possibility to be drafted later this year PERIOD

It takes more than one person to make a team and Penn State knows that PERIOD It was teamwork that helped the Lions become the Big Ten champions for the fourth consecutive year and the winner of the Big Ten Tournament for the third time in the last four years PERIOD

Before the start of the NCAA Tournament Penn State was ranked seventh in the nation PERIOD One would think therefore that come seeding time the Lions would be one of the top eight seeds PERIOD

Wrong PERIOD

Penn State got shafted PERIOD

It wasnt ranked seventh or even eighth for that matter PERIOD

But the Lions got their chance to prove just where they should have been ranked all along when they went to eighthseeded and No PERIOD  Connecticut in the third round of the NCAA Tournament on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD They beat the Huskies  to advance to the quarterfinals PERIOD

And then of course came the game that ended the season on a fluke goal with about  minutes left PERIOD According to a press release after the game Oleksiuk came out of the goal to clear the ball PERIOD She arrived at the ball at the exact same time as Tar Heels forward Alyssa Ramsey PERIOD Oleksiuk kicked the ball to clear it as Ramsey turned her back PERIOD At that second the ball hit off of Ramseys butt and caromed into the goal to end the game PERIOD

Had Oleksiuk cleared the ball who knows how the game would have ended And the fact is it could have just as easily been Penn State that came out on top PERIOD The Lions missed their chance to prove the pollsters wrong this season and thats unfortunate  unfortunate because everything points to the fact that they deserved a chance at the title PERIOD But thats just how things go sometimes PERIOD

And for Penn State thats just how things have gone all season  and now the seasons all gone PERIOD
