7855,2014-10-09,"what is college all about Of course theres the preparation for entering society as a fullfledged adult PERIOD Thats what taking classes and doing research is for Eventually you become an expert in your area of study and are ready to contribute back to the world PERIOD

Theres also the more personal aspect PERIOD Youre at college to get to know new people and make friends PERIOD You learn about different cultures and expose yourself to different ways of life and in so doing take the best parts of what you learn with you PERIOD By the end of your college career youve not only become more worldly which can help when youre contributing back to the world but learn more about yourself in the process PERIOD

These dual achievements are what college is for PERIOD And as such its what commencement is all about  or should be about PERIOD Recently it seems like commencements have strayed a lot further away from their purpose of celebrating a major milestone in students professional and personal lives PERIOD One need to look only at the petition to force Bill Maher to withdraw from his commencement address at UC Berkeley after making incendiary remarks PERIOD Regardless of where you stand on the issue its become readily apparent that a commencement address has mutated into something much different PERIOD

Instead of celebrating the formation of friendships and tightening of bonds its divided a community with countless accomplishments to be proud of PERIOD Students have questioned UC Berkeleys administration for inviting Maher and the administration has itself cleaved in its support PERIOD The student body is of two minds A counterpetition has now surfaced asking Maher to stay PERIOD The result is that a virulent backandforth over free speech versus hate speech has overshadowed what is supposed to be a celebratory occasion for students and all who have supported them PERIOD Maher has said that the only reason he will withdraw is to prevent a media circus but hasnt that already happened

Whether Maher stays or goes is between him and the students of UC Berkeley PERIOD But it is emblematic even if it is a particularly heated example of what commencement ceremonies all too often are PERIOD Instead of celebrating students the commencement ends up focusing more on the speaker than the students with the speakers patting themselves on the back for giving such an amazing speech PERIOD Students whether divided by ideology or more physically segregated from the friends they have gained in college and worked with for years are shunted into chairs alongside individuals they hardly know PERIOD And after paying through the nose for tuition selling an arm for a parking permit and a leg for a set of books the last hurrah is marked by well markups on caps tassels and gowns PERIOD

Commencement is certainly not all that bad and many students are just as thrilled to attend their commencement as their parents are to watch PERIOD But as with anything it can be improved upon PERIOD And for graduating students with uncertain job prospects cost is the first thing that comes to mind PERIOD After what feels like years of being nickeled and dimed by the bookstore parking tickets renters and who knows what else the last thing students want to see is another pricetag  and this time for something supposed to celebrate their successes PERIOD UCR provides soontobe graduates with coupons providing discounts on caps and gowns PERIOD But surely it wouldnt be a bridge too far to cover the cost entirely The price shouldnt be too exorbitant PERIOD If UCR isnt willing to cover the cost by itself partnerships with local vendors or donations from the community could help PERIOD Highlanders are third in the nation in community service and actively give back to not just UCR but the Inland Empire in countless ways PERIOD Given the School of Medicines impressively successful accreditation effort due mostly to community donations something similar could be achieved when it comes to commencement PERIOD

The way that UCR arranges its commencements could use some tweaks as well PERIOD Although we appreciate the current format of delineating ceremonies by college this often leaves many students graduating without the friends they know PERIOD Students dont just make friends in the classroom through involvement in clubs hanging out in the HUB or simply visiting the recreation center we meet many a different stripe of person frequently with different majors PERIOD

Obviously coordinating several ceremonies is a massive undertaking and destroying the current system of collegebased commencements would only make that worse PERIOD But instead of breaking down the large colleges of CHASS and CNAS by major another option is to allow students to graduate with the people they want PERIOD A sort of priority system is a possibility where students wanting to graduate together can select a preferred date for their graduation ceremony PERIOD It may not guarantee a graduation together but its something worth looking into to improve the chances of a happy ending PERIOD

Theres also the matter of the speaker PERIOD Its no easy task to arrange for a Steve Jobs or Barack Obama to speak at commencement PERIOD That doesnt mean its necessarily impossible PERIOD But speaker search committees should place a renewed focus on drawing in unique speakers with the possibility to excite students PERIOD Entrepreneurs or politicians are fine  but expand the search criteria to include popular musicians actors and others wellknown among students PERIOD To that end the committee in charge of finding speakers needs to be more accessible to students than ever PERIOD Students are already involved in speaker selection but gathering more student input via polls or a public forum could be beneficial PERIOD

Maher has certainly brought the spotlight to Berkeley PERIOD But all too often there is no spotlight on commencement at all PERIOD UCR can help change that by implementing studentfriendly changes that inspire students to go to their commencement and enjoy it PERIOD After all who would want their final impression of college to be an impersonal and expensive one
