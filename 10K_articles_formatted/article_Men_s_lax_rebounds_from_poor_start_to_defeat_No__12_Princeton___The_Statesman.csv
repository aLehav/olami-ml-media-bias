Remember Me



On Saturday afternoon the Stony Brook mens lacrosse team battled back from an early deficit to defeat the No PERIOD 12Princeton Tigers in a  thriller PERIOD

It was a classic college lacrosse game between two great academic institutions PERIOD I was very very proud of my team Head Coach Jim Nagle said PERIOD

The Seawolves got off to a slow start letting up four goals in the first quarter while only scoring one PERIOD

Princetons star midfielder Kip Orban who will play in the MLL in Charlotte next year and leads all midfielders in the nation in goals per game set an aggressive tone early burying two shots in the first quarter PERIOD Orban would go on to have five goals on the day two of which were unassisted PERIOD



Hes just a great player he really is PERIOD Hes big hes strong he shoots the ball with two hands and he can get a shot off quickly PERIOD I think a lot of times you see with these big shooters they take a long time to get rid of the ball Nagle said PERIOD

The Seawolves sole firstquarter goal came at the hands of freshman midfielder Matt Robison PERIOD This was Robisons first goal in a Stony Brook uniform PERIOD

He played like a senior today Nagle said PERIOD

Stony Brook bounced back quickly as junior attack Brody Eastwood scored directly after a Jay Lindsayfaceoff win and a dish from sophomore midfielder Jeff Reh to kick off the second quarter PERIOD

We werent possessing the ball like we should have and were always throwing it away and making very long possessions for the defense PERIOD But I thought we really picked it up after that first quarter Eastwood said PERIOD

Eastwood would prove to be the leading scorer of the game for the Seawolves with five goals PERIOD This puts Eastwood at the 40goal mark on the season for the second straight year PERIOD

My teammates were finding me great PERIOD I cant do anything without my teammates Eastwood said PERIOD

By halftime Stony Brook held a  lead as sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer and junior midfielder Chris Hughes all found the back of the net PERIOD

Hughes would end the game with five pointstwo goals and three assists PERIOD

At the  mark in the second Princetons Austin deButts was penalized  seconds for an illegal procedure PERIOD From there the Tigers would be a man down three more times for a total of  minutes PERIOD This opened things up for the Seawolves who capitalized on three of their four manup opportunities PERIOD

We do a lot of work on manup and we take a lot of pride in our manup PERIOD I think today it really showed Hughes said PERIOD

Princeton would tie the game at eight via a  third quarter goal by Orban but after a senior midfielder Mike Rooney goal off of a junior midfielder Challen Rogers assist with  remaining in the third Stony Brook would hold on to the lead for the remainder of the contest PERIOD

The Seawolves scored six times in the last two quarters with the likes of Eastwood Hughes Rooney and junior attack Matt Schultz tallying goals PERIOD

But the win can largely be attested to exceptional goal play by freshman Brandon Maciejewski who showed remarkable composure down the stretch especially for a freshman as he notched four saves in the fourth quarter and eight total on the day PERIOD Maciejewski played the full  minutes in goal PERIOD

The kids so calm all the time never gets raddled PERIOD He played great for us today Hughes said about his teammate PERIOD

He had ice water in his veins Nagle said PERIOD

With this win Stony Brook which currently sits at the 29thspot in Division I rankings has a legitimate chance of propelling itself into the top twenty PERIOD

The polls dont really play into what we do PERIOD Were just focused on being the best team we can be Nagle said PERIOD

Stony Brook looks to transfer its surging momentum into a conference matchup against UMass Lowell when the Seawolves head to Massachusetts on Friday April  PERIOD
