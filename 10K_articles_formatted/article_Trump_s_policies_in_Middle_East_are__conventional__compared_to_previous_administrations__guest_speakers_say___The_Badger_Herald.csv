The Alexander Hamilton Society hosted two experts Wednesday night in a lecture titled Political Chess in the Middle East specifically between Saudi Arabia and Iran PERIOD

University of Wisconsin history professorDaniel Stolz began the discussion with a provocation President Donald Trumps policies in the Middle East are conventional for an American president PERIOD

Stolz said that while Trump has made some headlinegrabbing moves in the Middle East like moving the U.S PERIOD Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and his tepid response following the Saudi governmentorchestrated killing of Jamal Khashoggi his fundamental policy is very similar to presidents of the past PERIOD Stolz believed former President Barack Obama wouldnt have reacted in any different substantive way to Khashoggis execution PERIOD

Trumps policies are consistent with decades of American policy in the Middle East in particular the steadfast commitment to Saudi government and to containing the Iranian Revolution Stolz said PERIOD

Trumps erratic policies make future of Middle East uncertain speaker saysThe Middle East Studies lecture series welcomed prominent commentator and professor Juan Cole to discuss President Donald Trumps unpredictablepolicy making Read

Michael Rubin a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute a conservative think tank agreed with Stolz saying there is far more consistency than the press makes it seem PERIOD

What makes Trump different from other presidents Rubin said is his style PERIOD

When it comes to style I would say that President Trump is much closer to a Gulf Arab leader Rubin said PERIOD He surrounds himself with generals he refuses to divest from family businesses there is an amorphous chain of command among family members  and he bashes the press mercilessly. rubin also said there is a large gap between how Americas culture operates and how these cultures operate PERIOD

The problem was further complicated by the fact that militant groups have been and are currently allied with Iran Rubin said PERIOD

Fundamentally we need to recognize that different cultures can think in very very different ways and the worst thing we can do analytically is project our own thoughts onto others Rubin said PERIOD I am not saying that all Iranians are homogeneous  but it is the guys with the guns that matter and within that context that ideology matters. vox cofounder finds Trump to be conventional on domestic policy troubling on foreign policyA panel hosted by the University of Wisconsin La Follette School of Public Affairs found President Donald Trump to be Read

One of the final points brought up by Stolz was whether the arms deal between America and Saudi Arabia was moral PERIOD One concern that complicates the moral equation is whether Saudi Arabia will simply get their weapons from someone else if America ends their deal PERIOD

Rubin said it depends on the scale of the weapons PERIOD If they are smaller weapons such as firearms it is possible Saudi Arabia could get them elsewhere PERIOD But when it comes to larger scale weapons like fighter jets it would be more difficult for Saudi Arabia to replace them PERIOD

Stolz said Americans should be looking at the big picture PERIOD

In moral terms the debate over whether we should be selling people weapons to do horrible things so that someone else cannot sell them weapons to do horrible things is just a bizarre debate Stolz said PERIOD
