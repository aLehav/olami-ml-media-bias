1966,2018-11-15,"anyone who has been to Club Fest has experienced the sensory overload of dozens of tables and hundreds of students crammed into a room in the Kimmel Center for University Life PERIOD Club leaders try to get the attention of confused firstyear wanderers as loud voices echo across the room in attempts to lure students before they dash off to their classes PERIOD

The worst part according to Product Designer for NYU IT Sarth Desai is that sometimes little comes out of this besides students being added to dozens of mailing lists PERIOD Drawing from this disheartening experience he had with Club Fest as a graduate student in the Tandon School of Engineering in  Desai helped create Find My Club a new app NYU released late last month to change the way students connect with clubs on campus PERIOD

Now a student can simply open their NYU Mobile App and click on Find My Club PERIOD After selecting any number of  different interests students have the additional option of filtering results through  subcategories PERIOD These functions are intended to help students search for and follow clubs that grab their attention PERIOD

Senior Vice President of Student Affairs Marc Wais whose team worked with NYU IT Operations Technology and Support Services on the apps production says it allows students to find all the information of Club Fest in one place PERIOD

This new app provides students a one stop opportunity to connect with clubs and organizations throughout NYU Wais wrote in an email to WSN PERIOD

Once a student selects a club to follow they can see its events and announcements PERIOD Additionally they can join the club through the app although this requires the approval of the presidents PERIOD The app saw  unique student logins within  days after its launch a number that Wais said showed that more students want to engage with the university than are currently able to do so PERIOD

The app was created by Desais team Student Tech Innovation which is made up of  to  students from different schools within NYU at the graduate and undergraduate level PERIOD Focusing on how to improve the student experience Desai and his team hoped to make an app suited for NYU newcomers drawing inspiration from Spotifys recommendation method and Airbnbs filter function when designing the app PERIOD

Tisch firstyear Cassie Vega said she enjoyed the app and that it could be a good tool to those looking to be more involved at NYU PERIOD

I think it could be a really useful resource for people who are looking to get more involved on campus but dont know where to start Vega said PERIOD

Stern sophomore Elizabeth Chen found that the apps calendar which allows students to see events of the clubs they are following was a nice touch PERIOD

I like the calendar function because a bunch of clubs I was trying to go to arent clear with their meeting time and location Chen said PERIOD

In phase two Desai hopes to use machine learning to streamline the recommendation process and figure out what types of events and clubs students are most likely to attend PERIOD For now he is gathering student feedback on the app PERIOD Desai attributes any success thus far to focusing on student voices throughout the process PERIOD Not only did he confer with student government and heads of clubs at NYU while developing the app but his allstudent team played the largest role in its creation PERIOD

It works really well because its students who are building for students Desai said PERIOD
