2647,2023-11-04,"kari Pestolesi stands on the left side of the court PERIOD She watches as the ball travels to the firstyear starter Marissa Alvarez PERIOD The sophomore setter receives the ball PERIOD She extends her elbows and pushes the ball in the direction of the senior outside hitter PERIOD

While Alvarez receives the ball Kari launches herself into the air PERIOD She winds her arm ready to slap the ball with a ferocity that would leave a red mark on the human flesh PERIOD Her hand meets the ball and produces a distinct sound that fills the Bren Events Center PERIOD

She violently fires the ball onto the USC side of the court PERIOD The ball finds a hole in the Trojan defense PERIOD The referee raises her hand pointing toward the UC Irvine side  awarding the point to the Anteaters PERIOD The Eaters have increased their lead to  in the second set PERIOD

The threepoint lead was followed by an immediate and ecstatic reaction from Kari PERIOD Her excitement resulted not only from the fact that the Anteaters were beating the No PERIOD  team in the nation threatening to put the first blemish on a  win zero loss team but also because she was beating the same team that denied her a spot on the Trojan roster and the chance to play outside hitter PERIOD

The USC rejection proved to be the ultimate gain for the UC Irvine womens volleyball program PERIOD The Huntington Beach native opted to stay in Orange County and attend the one program that gave her the opportunity to pursue her volleyball goals PERIOD

I did not have many opportunities to play outside hitter PERIOD USC said I could walkon and play libero Pestolesi said PERIOD I did not want to play libero PERIOD I wanted to hit I wanted to block I wanted to do all of that PERIOD So it was either UCI or Long Beach State and UCI was the better fit. uC Irvines decision to allow Pestolesi to play outside hitter paid immediate dividends PERIOD Former womens volleyball Head Coach Charlie Brande decided to start the outside hitter as a true freshman and from that point on there was no looking back PERIOD

As a freshman Pestolesi grabbed UC Irvine womens volleyball and the Big West by the horns PERIOD In her first year she led the team in kills with  recorded  service aces which also ranked first on the team and finished second with  digs PERIOD She became the first Anteater to be named AVCA Freshman of the Year PERIOD She was also named Big West Freshman of the Year awarded to the First Team AllBig West and given AVCA AllWest Region Honorable Mention PERIOD In the Big West Pestolesi finished fifth in kills per game with . and sixth in service aces per set PERIOD

In her second year Pestolesi proved that her freshman statistics were no fluke and she would continue to have a tremendous impact on the success of womens volleyball PERIOD In  Pestolesi would once again lead the team with  kills  service aces and her  digs were good for second on the team PERIOD Once again she received AVCA AllWest Region Honorable Mention and was named to the First Team AllBig West PERIOD

Pestolesis success as a sophomore translated into wins PERIOD The Anteaters started the season with a  record but then the team caught fire as they closed out the season winning  out of their last  games PERIOD This momentous finish put the Anteaters on the verge of making the playoffs for the very first time PERIOD But after taking two teams from the Big West in  the AVCA decided to give a playoff berth to just one Big West school leaving the Anteaters out of the postseason hunt PERIOD

Despite being named Big West Coach of the year and being on the cusp of making the playoffs Coach Charlie Brande decided to retire leaving the coaching position vacant PERIOD

UC Irvine would once again be reminded why it was a good decision to allow Pestolesi to play volleyball as an Anteater PERIOD She wanted to bring in one of the most successful women in college volleyball to coach the Anteaters PERIOD

I dont remember thinking that anyone else was ever going to get hired PERIOD Paula Weishoff was going to be our coach PERIOD I had it set in my head Pestolesi said PERIOD

One of the biggest reasons why Kari wanted to bring Coach Weishoff to UCI was because of the relationship that existed between the two PERIOD Weishoff lived down the street from Kari and played with Pestolesis mom on a junior national team PERIOD

I told my teammates guys we want Paula you will all love her she is good at what she does Pestolesi said PERIOD The rest of the team responded by saying who is Paula

This led Pestolesi to print out all of the accolades that Weishoff earned during her days as a player and coach including a silver medal in the  Olympics held in Los Angeles and a gold medal in the  and  NORCECA Championships PERIOD While at USC she was part of three DI national titles one as a player and two as an assistant coach PERIOD Before coming to Irvine Weishoff coached the Eagles of Concordia University and left the program as the winningest coach as she accumulated a  record PERIOD

This is all it took for the rest of the team to get onboard with Kari as they lobbied for Coach Weishoff PERIOD

Everyone wanted her really bad and we just kept our fingers crossed hoping they would hire her Pestolesi said PERIOD

And so it was as UCIs athletic director Mike Izzi would go on to hire Weishoff PERIOD

It did not take long for Coach Weishoff to change the culture of womens volleyball here at UCI PERIOD

Once Paula took over we were held more accountable Pestolesi said PERIOD We were more of a family we had to sit down as a team to make our team rules and our team identity. this immediate change proved to be successful PERIOD In Weishoffs first year as head coach the Anteaters posted a record of  and had the fewest losses since  PERIOD

The relationship between Pestolesi and Weishoff certainly attributed to last years success PERIOD

We understand each other a lot because we have been around each other so much Pestolesi said PERIOD It helps in the gym because I can look at her and I know what she is feeling or trying to say. despite the fact that Weishoff brought instant success to the womens volleyball program the Anteaters were once again left out of the postseason picture PERIOD

This season should be different as the Anteaters played a very tough nonconference schedule that featured six of the nations top  teams PERIOD This was done in order for the Anteaters to become a topcaliber team that can compete with best PERIOD

Although the team has opened up its season with   and has lost its first two conference games Pestolesi believes this team has the makings of a playoff contender PERIOD

This year we are going to be a lot more successful because everyone has bought into Coach Weishoffs system Pestolesi said PERIOD We know we have to play with the best teams and win the conference if we want to be in the playoffs. as the teams only fouryear starter the pressure falls on Pestolesi to lead the Anteaters PERIOD
