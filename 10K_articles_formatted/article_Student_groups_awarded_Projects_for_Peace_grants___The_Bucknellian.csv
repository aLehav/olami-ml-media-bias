Projects for Peace an organization which awards grants to student groups recently gave grants of  to two groups on campus Yehri Wi Cry and Bicycles Against Poverty PERIOD

Yehri Wi Cry which translates from Krio to Hear Our Cry is a project begun by Nadia Sasso  an English and sociology major at the University PERIOD The project grew with help from the current Miss Sierra LeoneUSA Marie Mansaray PERIOD

The  project strives to provide maternal kits to Sierra Leone where low birth  rates are be a problem PERIOD Because of cultural taboos against hospitals  many natives of the area are unwilling to go to a hospital when giving  birth PERIOD

Sowande Parkinson  a civil engineer and economics major has worked with Sasso to develop this project PERIOD Weve always wanted to do a project that will connect us to our native country Sasso said PERIOD

The materinal kits contain basic necessities to aid in sanitation and the prevention of the spread of HIVAIDS PERIOD

We also plan to do a workshop with the aides of the hospital to make sure they know how to use the kits Sasso said PERIOD

Sasso and Parkinson will travel to Sierra Leone this summer to deliver  of the birth kits PERIOD While there they will provide training to the aides PERIOD

By June were looking to receive 501C3 status which will recognize us as an official nonprofit Sasso said PERIOD

As a nonprofit organization more grants would become available PERIOD Various volunteers also help with other aspects of the organization such as working as a webmaster PERIOD

Bicycles Against Poverty a project launched by a University student in  provides bicycles to Ugandan farmers PERIOD Kevin Matthews 11and Brian Chiu  two mechanical engineers have been working to manufacture an additional device for the bicycles PERIOD

The machine that were making is a humanpowered grain grinder using bicycles because we know that bicycles are availableMatthews said PERIOD

The device is a part of a senior design project and Chiu and Matthews have been working on this with two other mechanical engineers Paul Moellers  and Kevin Curran  PERIOD

The actual machine is really simple especially compared to a lot of the other senior design PERIOD We had a lot of constraints such as making it as cheap as possible and being able to make it in Uganda Matthews said PERIOD

Matthews hopes that the grinder will provide not only an easier method for grain grinding but also the ability to support a local machine shop PERIOD This would help to create a sustainable small business PERIOD

The main premise is a partnership with BAP and Gyda and what they do is they train youth in the city with technical skills to help them get a job PERIOD Gyda will make it and BAP will help distribute it in the village Matthews said PERIOD

In addition to the grain grinder two other devices that can be used with the bicycles have been in production a bicycle taxi and a bicycle cart PERIOD

The carts attach to the back of the bicycles allowing a greater carrying capacity PERIOD Chemical engineer Tom Bollinger  is working on the cart PERIOD

The whole point of it is low cost and highuse technology PERIOD The carts reduce trips from five to six trips per day to about one Bollinger said PERIOD

The location provides additional constraints and challenges PERIOD

Were not sure how everything will turn it PERIOD When we get over there we know well be faced with things that we dont expect so we have to be flexible with both the design and how were going to implement the project Matthews said PERIOD
