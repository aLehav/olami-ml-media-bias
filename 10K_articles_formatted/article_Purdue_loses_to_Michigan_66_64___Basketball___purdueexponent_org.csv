Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Despite a bounceback performance from redshirt senior forward
Robbie Hummel Purdue lost to Michigan  PERIOD

With Purdue starting the game slowly again this season the
Boilermakers allowed the Wolverines to jump out to a  early in
the first half PERIOD From then on it was Hummel breaking out of his
slump from the loss in East Lansing that sparked the entire Purdue
team PERIOD

With  left in the first half Hummel made his first field
goal since the home game against Iowa last Tuesday PERIOD From there he
began to look like his old self finishing the game with  points
six assists five rebounds and zero turnovers PERIOD

He got some shots in rhythm that he was able to knock down
head coach Matt Painter said PERIOD I thought he did a good job of
moving the basketball on offense and he had six assists and no
turnovers PERIOD It was good to see him for his confidence make some
shots. hummel flashed some of that regained confidence in the closing
minutes of the first half when with Purdue trailing  he hit
a threepointer had a put back and made a layup to record Purdues
final seven points of the half PERIOD

But despite ending the first half with all of the momentum the
Boilers began the second half with a  second field goal drought
that allowed Michigan to extend its lead to  PERIOD

Once again it was Hummel that triggered the teams offense when
he hit the first field goal of the half from the top of the key
after helping swarm Michigan to force a turnover PERIOD

From there Purdue went on a  run that culminated in a
Hummel jumper that gave the Boilermakers a  lead PERIOD

Michigan and Purdue then exchanged buckets down the stretch
with the final  featuring seven lead changes PERIOD

We got some momentum with some made baskets and made threes
and we were doing a good job of executing and getting good looks
we simply couldnt stop them Painter said PERIOD We didnt do a good
job of containing the dribble we didnt do a good job of rotating
sometimes on shooters then once we did rotate they broke us down
and got to the basket. ultimately the game came down to a final offensive possession
for Purdue where with  seconds left Painter called his last
timeout in order to draw up a play PERIOD

Purdue inbounded the ball and was able to get it to one of its
best shooters Ryne Smith who missed a threepointer PERIOD The Boilers
came away with the rebound though and got another attempt to win
on a Hummel threepoint shot which also rimmed out PERIOD Michigan was
able to secure the rebound after the shot giving the Wolverines a
twopoint win PERIOD

Thats who we wanted shooting the shots Painter said PERIOD We
wanted to get to the rim or we wanted to get a rhythm jump shot
from one of our shooters and the last two or three shots are shots
wed take any day of the week they just didnt go down. while Hummel acknowledged his disappointment over missing the
shot he credited his team with setting him up PERIOD

The last good look we got Lewis did a great job penetrating
Hummel said PERIOD Then he pitched it back to me which was basically
what the play was PERIOD I got a great look I just didnt knock it down PERIOD
I was basically wide open so Lewis did  percent what he needed
to do and unfortunately I didnt. senior guard Lewis Jackson spoke confidently for his teammate
though saying he was fully behind the play and explaining that he
would run that same set every time in that situation PERIOD

I would do that play  more times the shot just didnt
fall Jackson said PERIOD We all know Robs a great shooter PERIOD I dont
regret the way it happened if coach called that again theres no
second guessing it goes in next time. jackson did credit the Wolverines for playing well throughout
the game but said the Boilers will be looking for revenge in Ann
Arbor later this season PERIOD

Youve got to tip your hat to Michigan Jackson said PERIOD They
made the plays at the end to finish and well get them next
