ISAAC SEMMLER Evergreen reporterApril  

WSU baseball snapped a 12game losing streak defeating Gonzaga  on Tuesday night at BaileyBrayton Field PERIOD

Freshman lefthanded pitcher Tyson Guerrero made his second start of the season and had a dominant first inning PERIOD All three hitters he faced grounded out to sophomore second baseman Garrett Gouldsmith PERIOD

Freshman infielder Kodie Kolden got things started for the Cougars  with a lead off bunt followed by a tworun home run from senior shortstop Andres Alvarez to give WSU an early  lead PERIOD

Guerreros solid pitching in the first carried over in the second as the Zags  went down one two three again behind a strong defense PERIOD

In the bottom half of the second Kolden smashed a threerun home run with two outs to push the Cougars lead to  PERIOD

I just saw a pitch I could handle and it paid off Kolden said PERIOD It was a good feeling to get out on a hot start. though Guerrero is normally a midgame reliever he looked unhittable as he knocked out three quick innings with ease as the Cougs still led  PERIOD

Gonzaga redshirt junior lefthanded pitcher Matthew Henckel completed his first scoreless inning of the game in the third after struggling early on PERIOD

The Bulldogs knocked in their first run of the evening in the fourth to narrow the lead to  PERIOD

Guerrero would be replaced by freshman righthanded pitcher Zane Mills after   innings of work and just  pitches PERIOD

Head Coach Marty Lees said he loved Guerreros performance and hopes to see it in the next series as well PERIOD

I really thought Tyson came out and set the tone for us Lees said PERIOD I thought he gave us a really great start. alvarezs hot day at the plate continued as he lined a shot up the middle to score a run PERIOD Then senior catcher Rob Teel hit a ball to deep left center field to give the Cougars an  lead PERIOD

Through five innings WSU was dominating both on offense and defense PERIOD

Junior outfielder Danny Sinatro reached base with his second walk of the night in the sixth and Teel would bring him in to increase the lead to  PERIOD

The Zags rallied back with a huge inning in the seventh as they loaded the bases with nobody out and scored six runs off of five straight hits and two errors to pull within two runs PERIOD

Fortunately WSU answered right back in the next half inning as Kolden and Sinatro brought in a combined three runs to give WSU a comfortable  lead PERIOD

The Bulldogs rallied yet again in the eighth for a couple of runs and they also launched a solo home run in the ninth to pull within two again but couldnt quite complete the rally PERIOD

Kolden said the momentum from this victory will carry over into their threegame road series with Cal this weekend PERIOD

I think this will really help us against Cal Kolden said PERIOD When we get that hot on offense good things happen. the Cougars head to Berkeley for a threegame series against Cal starting  p.m PERIOD Friday at Evans Diamond PERIOD The game can also be seen live on Pac12 Networks PERIOD
