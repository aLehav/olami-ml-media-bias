Mens basketball  overall  ASun fell  to the Stetson Hatters  overall  ASun on Feb PERIOD  at the UNF Arena PERIOD This marked the Ospreys first Atlantic Sun conference loss this season after a programbest  start PERIOD

In the first half UNF grabbed the first points of the night from the free throw line PERIOD The Hatters started with backtoback empty possessions before starting a run midway through the period PERIOD The teams exchanged buckets the Ospreys from outside and Stetson scoring inside but the Hatters seemed to be one step ahead for most of contest PERIOD

Late in the half double technicals fouls were given to UNF forward Chris Davenport and Stetson guard Grant Lozoya PERIOD This resulted in both having three fouls at that point of the game and foul trouble plagued the Ospreys down the stretch PERIOD

The Hatters led by as many as  points before UNF began to rally to close the gap and the Ospreys went into the locker room trailing  behind the Hatters PERIOD

UNF mens basketball head coach Matthew Driscoll said poor defense and not making threes were the problem PERIOD

I just think we didnt guard very well. driscoll said PERIOD I mean we score  points and we missed five straight threes in one point and they were all open PERIOD All of them. after the break UNF took the lead early in the second period with a jumper from UNF guard Trent Mackey PERIOD The Ospreys extended their lead over the Hatters before Stetson forward Brian Pegg tied the game  all PERIOD

Fouls became a problem for UNF forward Beau Beech PERIOD Beech fouled out late in the second half finishing with  points and  rebounds PERIOD Davenport and forward Demarcus Daniels both had four fouls by the end of the night PERIOD

With over a minute left guard Dallas Moore pushed the Ospreys up  PERIOD Moore tallied a gamehigh  points  rebounds and  assists PERIOD

In the last few possessions scoring went back and forth before Stetson forward Derick Newton sealed the  win for the Hatters with free throws PERIOD Newton finished the game with  points and  rebounds PERIOD He went  from the line PERIOD

UNF connected from downtown only  times out of their  attempts PERIOD From the field the Ospreys completed  percent of their shots while Stetson made nearly  percent of their shots PERIOD

UNF guard Nick Malonga said the teams energy was flat PERIOD

I mean I feel like we came out with no energy in the beginning Malonga said PERIOD And they hadan early lead but we pick it up in the second half but we needed those five consecutive stops. next the Ospreys will go on the road to face the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles  overall  ASun on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD This will be the second time in a week the two Atlantic Sun leaders will face off PERIOD
