9032,2023-11-04,"umps proposed Middle East policy should pain conservatives and liberals alike PERIOD Proposed and policy are both strong words here as his foreign policy platform still remains little more than bullet points and speech snippets on his campaign website PERIOD From recent actions and tweets why are tweets a serious policy outlet now were learning a bit more about what he specifically has in mind for U.S.Israel relations and it looks grim for Israel PERIOD

Wait a second for Israel Didnt he just appoint David Friedman a settlement supporter so hardline he makes the American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC seem dovish to be the U.S PERIOD ambassador to Israel Isnt this just giving Prime Minister Netanyahus rightwing government what theyve wanted Well in the short term yes PERIOD But the longterm implications of U.S PERIOD support for Israeli annexation of the West Bank something Friedman has publicly floated run counter to the interests of all parties involved PERIOD

Israeli politicians and their U.S PERIOD allies frequently speak of the need to preserve a uniquely Jewish and democratic state in the Middle East PERIOD From a conservative perspective Israels continued stability and democratic norms are indispensable to U.S PERIOD interests in the region PERIOD But as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the building of the first settlement in the occupied West Bank it becomes increasingly clear that if Friedman and Trump get their way Israel will be neither a Jewish nor a democratic state PERIOD

Nowformer Secretary of State John Kerry observed the status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual occupation. one state would mean Israel absorbing the Palestinian and largely nonJewish population of the West Bank thus creating a Jewish state where  of the population is not Jewish PERIOD Some Israeli demographers such as Sergio DellaPergola claim that Jews could even be rendered a minority in a onestate solution because of a relatively high birth rate among Palestinians and the possible return of refugees PERIOD Given the Israeli governments history on the subject of Palestinian civil rights citizenship and voting rights for Palestinians most likely wont improve in this future state PERIOD While it might have passed as democratic one hundred years ago no modern democracy can claim such a title and yet deny full civic engagement to such a large demographic PERIOD

If I were a conservative advisor to Trump I would tell him that if you really want to be a friend to Israel you need to help its government kick its addiction to settlement expansion outside of existing blocs PERIOD As settlements expand deeper and deeper into occupied territory they become more and more of a security liability PERIOD While settlement expansion may appease some ultrareligious constituents wishing to reclaim their birthright it also empowers radical Islamist calls to violence and legitimizes Arab skepticism of the West PERIOD

Instead Trumps ultimate deal should include provisions that strengthen Israeli security while providing for increased economic opportunity for Palestinians PERIOD The centerright Israel Policy Forum outlines a plan in which Israel clarifies it has no claim on sovereignty east of the security barrier and engages in mutual land swaps that would give Israel claim to the largest settlement blocs PERIOD Israel would then be able to increase security as it sees fit in officially sovereign territory and free itself from the bulk of international legal controversy PERIOD

Given the current lack of economic opportunity in the West Bank many Palestinians work in Israel illegally PERIOD Instead of stopping this Israel should instead embark on a path of economic normalization with its neighbors PERIOD This could include issuing thousands more work permits allowing connection between Israeli and Palestinian banks investing in Palestinian infrastructure and easing restrictions on movements of goods within the West Bank PERIOD These investments would hopefully serve to create economic interdependence and reduce Palestinian resentment of Israel PERIOD

While I personally do not agree with the entirety of this plan I do believe it would appeal to longerterm conservative interests PERIOD Preserving Israels Jewish and democratic character is vital to U.S PERIOD conservative interests in the Middle East PERIOD Trump should not let Netanyahus reckless expansion policies endanger these interests for the sake of courting a small minority of voters. as for myself I would hope that the U.S PERIOD could care about the rights of brown people regardless of how it plays to our security interests but apparently thats too much to ask nowadays PERIOD
