They have been together for four years but have never won a championship PERIOD

Javs Finest is the No PERIOD  team in intramural basketball entering into the postseason tournament  and they plan on finishing that way PERIOD

Most of us are seniors guard Tracy Carter said PERIOD We are trying to win it this year. intramural basketball playoffs begin Monday with games being played from  p.m PERIOD at the HPER building Monday through Thursday PERIOD The championships will be held March  with the women playing at  p.m PERIOD and the men at  p.m PERIOD

Javs Finest has tasted success in the past making the final four in  and the championship game last season PERIOD

But despite not winning it all the team is confident about its chances of taking home the intramural title this year PERIOD

We might have trouble in the championship game forward Jonah Cox said PERIOD We will come out and play hard. this attitude is apparent in the way they appear for games PERIOD The team wears black jerseys representing where they are from with the town name printed on the top and Finest on the bottom PERIOD

I thought of that Carter said PERIOD

Javs Finest is one of several perennial intramural teams having been around for four years PERIOD However some members of the squad have been hearing the naysayers talk about their inability to win in the postseason PERIOD

Lately a lot of people have been making jokes about us not winning the big game team member Tony Hill said PERIOD We are going to surprise some people. surprisingly Javs Finest does not have a player over  but they can all shoot and run the floor PERIOD

We are explosive said Cox a Richmond Va. native PERIOD We can hit you from inside and outside. even before the tournament starts the team believes it will win the championship PERIOD They even think they could even hang with Tennessees mens basketball team PERIOD

We would give them a good run Cox said PERIOD

But playing the Vols is not on their minds right now PERIOD They are thinking how much it would mean to win an intramural championship PERIOD

It would be icing on the cake Hill said PERIOD
