A horseshoe sandwich is pictured above PERIOD Columnist Noah encourages the spread of the appreciation for the local dish PERIOD

By Noah Nelson Senior Columnist January  

Philadelphia is known for its cheesesteak sandwiches Chicago for its deep dish pizza Denver for its omelettes and New York City for its hot dogs PERIOD Though its not quite known throughout the word Central Illinois is famous for their own specialty food the horseshoe sandwich PERIOD

Its a local legend throughout the region and whether one lives there or not everyone should know what a horseshoe is PERIOD

Though its origin story is shaky many believe Springfields Leland Hotels head chef Joe Schweska invented the now famous creation in the late 1920s consisting of a slice of bread a kind of meat representing the horseshoe French fries for nails and hot cheese sauce for the glue PERIOD Its become a staple meal in Illinoiss capital city but the craze didnt halt there PERIOD

Nowadays anyone can find a horseshoe on almost any Central Illinois restaurant menu PERIOD From experience many are great in their own right but none are as delicious as those found at Springfields DArcys Pint PERIOD Its hard telling if the Irish Pub made the horseshoe famous or vice versa but if anyone makes a visit to President Lincolns historic home DArcys is a must stop PERIOD

Growing up in Central Illinois near Springfield it was always great to have the luxury of choosing a horseshoe on any menu and knowing the area has its own specialty food PERIOD The disappointing part of it is always telling someone from outside the area the excellence of a horseshoe and they have no idea what Im talking about PERIOD



Many of my friends are from the Chicagoland area and when I tell them about horseshoes they think Ive gone crazy PERIOD But its real PERIOD I keep telling them they have to try it out for themselves PERIOD

When my parents and many of their friends tell others who live outside of the Central Illinois area what a horseshoe is the same reaction occurs PERIOD Those who live out of state are even worse PERIOD Millions of people just dont know what a horseshoe is PERIOD

Its great to have our unique food choice but its sad that many people dont know of its existence PERIOD Everyone seems to know what a Philly Cheesesteak and a Denver omelette is both of those meals are popular nationwide PERIOD So why isnt a horseshoe

At the end of the day whether you know about Central Illinoiss best hidden gem or are just learning about it for the first time now everyone should know what it is PERIOD Its our own little slice of Americana and maybe  just maybe  itll tempt you to visit Central Illinois to try one for yourself PERIOD
