Students at any higher educational institution deserve a proper education and attention from professors  after all the students are the ones paying for the education PERIOD

At Northeastern students are paying well over  but are they getting what they paid for from tenured professors

When faculty enter the university they chose to embark on a path of tenure or nontenure track PERIOD If tenure track is the path chosen the professor then has seven years to in a way prove to the university that they are worthy of the prestigious title PERIOD

Once tenured the professors must focus on teaching service and scholarship PERIOD These focuses usually include research or publication of one form or another PERIOD Along with tenure also comes a large amount of academic freedom and job security PERIOD

From a student perspective it is only normal to wonder what the point of tenure is PERIOD Some students say if professors have chosen the profession to teach students then they should simply want the job security of tenure PERIOD Do professors embark on the tenure journey for professional betterment or for the making of better professionals

Is tenure about the individual the institution or the student

It is apparent and understandable that any professional wishes to succeed in their career of choice PERIOD As consumers Northeastern students should demand and expect the best from their professors PERIOD This being said students expect pure intentions nostringsattached approaches to education PERIOD

Tenured faculty should be rewarded for their performance both in and out of the classroom PERIOD Tenured or not students should reap the benefits of pure intentions and solid education PERIOD
