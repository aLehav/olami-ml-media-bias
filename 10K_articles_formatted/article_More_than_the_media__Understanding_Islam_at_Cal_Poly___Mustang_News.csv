Eight days after Muslim extremists attacked French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo Cal Polys Muslim Student Association MSA President Munir Eltal stood before a crowded University Union conference room PERIOD It overflowed with spectators in chairs on the floor and lining the hallway all anxious to learn about Islam PERIOD

The events announced title was The Five Pillars of Islam but Eltal suspected the discussion would quickly digress from that topic  and thats exactly what he wanted PERIOD

The five pillars dont address issues I think people are more interested in when they talk about Islam hesaid PERIOD People are curious Whats a Muslim What are they doing Why do they seem to hate us all

ThoughEltal had prepared a PowerPoint presentation and  minutes worth of talking points for last Thursdays event his plans were quickly overrun by questions from the audience PERIOD People asked about topics ranging from womens roles in Islam to the Qurans approach to violence PERIOD

Eltal didnt mind PERIOD

If you want to stem the tide of any Islamophobia any ignorance all you can do is educate he said PERIOD

The Charlie Hebdo massacre presented Cal Poly students with a crucial opportunity to learn about Islam PERIOD Eltal wanted to take advantage of the successful turnout to educate about issues most San Luis Obispo residents wouldnt normally encounter PERIOD

We live in the San Luis Obispo bubble where everyones happy and jolly Eltal said PERIOD Its the happiest place on Earth and relatively there are no issues here PERIOD No ones persecuted for their faiths or beliefs. while Muslim students might not feel targeted on campus he said its not necessarily because their peers know better  its because they dont care PERIOD

Apathy is the main perpetrator of ignorance about Islam on Cal Polys campus Eltal said PERIOD

When you dont have issues around you its really hard to feel for them he said PERIOD People here dont know Muslims PERIOD Its a minority group so its no ones fault PERIOD How are you going to meet them When you dont know someone or cant connect with them on a social personal or spiritual level youre going to be apathetic as a result PERIOD And thats what you get at this school. religious studies professor Stephen LloydMoffett who teaches Islam RELS  said Cal Polys lack of diversity is largely at fault for students apathy PERIOD

We can easily go a week without the need to encounter someone whos that different from us he said PERIOD Its an easier place to not be confronted with difference. and when people dont directly interact with Islam they have an easier time making assumptions about it PERIOD

Its very easy to demonize some abstraction LloydMoffett said PERIOD

Muslim students compose a particularly small minority at Cal Poly PERIOD For example the MSA has approximately30 active members Eltal said PERIOD Few Cal Poly students get the chance to meet Muslims meaning they miss out on one of the best ways to learn about the religion PERIOD

If people start hearing about Islam from Muslims or just even get to know a Muslim then theyll immediately connect with them better and put a face to it he said PERIOD

As it is many Muslims are burdened by widespread damaging misconceptions about their religion PERIOD Five common misunderstandings are listed below followed by clarification from experts on Islam in the Cal Poly community PERIOD

 PERIOD Muslims are all Arab

LloydMoffett said one of the biggest misunderstandings about Islam is that Muslims are all Arab PERIOD

According to the  Pew Report Arab Muslims are actually the minority whereas . percent of Muslims actually live in South and Southeast Asia PERIOD

We tend to forget the diversity within Islam LloydMoffett said PERIOD Yet we embrace it in every other instance. the  Pew Report estimated there are . billion Muslims worldwide spanning many countries and cultural traditions PERIOD Islamic traditions meld with their surrounding cultures like all religions LloydMoffett said so most controversies surrounding Islam stem from cultural traditions rather than the religion itself PERIOD

LloydMoffett suggested students go to the Mosque of Nasreen in San Luis Obispo and witness the diversity for themselves PERIOD

We have this view that Muslims are Arab he said but if you go to the mosque you see Iranians Indonesians Pakistanis Egyptians Africans  the most diverse place on a Friday in San Luis Obispo is the mosque. president of the Islamic Society of San Luis Obispo County Naiyerah Kolkailah said Islam is the common denominator between countless different traditions PERIOD

Islam lays down certain foundations and certain beliefs and certain basic practices and then it accommodates peoples different cultures Kolkailah said PERIOD Thats why its important also to understand Islam is not monolithic PERIOD The Islamic worldwide community is not monolithic. pERIOD Islam oppresses women

Kolkailah said Islam suffers from a reputation of repressing women especially regarding the hijab a head covering some Muslim women wear in public to uphold the ideal of modesty PERIOD

Kolkailah a lifelong Muslim said her experience wearing a hijab has been far from repressive PERIOD

The hijab protects women from societal standards of beauty she said freeing them to beautify themselves internally PERIOD

It saddens me to see so many girls feel pressured to lose weight and look a certain way to please other people she said PERIOD You see so many plastic surgeries and extreme dieting and what for Because society expects it. kolkailah said strangers sometimes react offensively to her hijab without knowing its true meaning PERIOD

I had experiences especially after  with people making comments in the street and guys in their big trucks yelling things out she said PERIOD Ive had people telling me Youre in America now you can take that off. things like that reek of ignorance. when Kolkailah clarifies the meaning behind the hijab to fellow Cal Poly students she usually gets positive responses she said PERIOD

When I explain the concept of the hijab and womens cover they themselves find it empowering because we are living in a society that objectifies women and uses womens bodies as sex objects to sell cars electronics even cosmetics using different parts of womens bodies to sell things she said PERIOD

LloydMoffett said Islamic cultures treatment of women usually varies based on geographical region PERIOD While some Islamic states practice female circumcision or do not permit women to drive others have had women as head of state  a line the United States has yet to cross PERIOD

If you want to find examples of repression of women there are plenty out there he said PERIOD If you want to find examples of really progressive views on women there are plenty out there. lloydMoffett used Afghan burqas which cover womens entire bodies except their eyes as an example of this cultural variance PERIOD

Theres nothing in the Quran advocating that a woman can only show her eyes but thats in Afghanistan he said PERIOD If you go to Turkey its like a fashion capital for women PERIOD Making broad statements about the role of women is difficult because its very localized to the place. pERIOD Muslims dont appreciate Christians and Jews

LloydMoffett said most people think Islam looks down on Christians and Jews when in fact Islam reveres Christianity and Judaism considering them sibling religions and categorizing their followers as people of the Book. islam views many of the Bibles characters  including Abraham Moses Jesus and John the Baptist  as prophets who carried a message from God PERIOD

While those prophets had a very clear message humans didnt always perceive that message in the right way so the message of God was convoluted over time LloydMoffett said PERIOD

Muslims believe that while Christians and Jews mistook the prophets messages and ended up with incomplete faiths they still warrant respect PERIOD

LloydMoffett said Islams positive approach to older related religions is atypical PERIOD

Usually if another religion appears in a religion its negative he said PERIOD This is one of few times where another religion is called out for honor PERIOD They dont have the complete truth but they deserve honor because God worked through them. pERIOD Muslims worship Muhammad andor Allah instead of God

Monotheism is central to Islam with God being the only entity worthy of worship LloydMoffett said PERIOD Muslims do not worship Muhammad  while they believe he was the final and greatest prophet he was also entirely human PERIOD

Muhammads role in Islam was to act as an exemplary Muslim and a mouthpiece for God who Muslims believe spoke directly through Muhammads body in a series of recitations PERIOD The content of these recitations is recorded in the Quran the Islamic sacred book PERIOD

The Quran was not meant to be a written recording of the inspired words of the prophets LloydMoffett said but rather God speaking directly PERIOD Its the direct word of God without any human intervention. when Muslims refer to Allah they are not speaking of a god named Allah  Allah simply means God in Arabic LloydMoffett said PERIOD Arabicspeaking Jews and Christians also refer to God as Allah. pERIOD Islam is inherently violent

The Charlie Hebdo massacre is the most recent example of a series of widely reported terrorist attacks categorized as Islamic extremism dating back to  PERIOD The medias portrayal of such events is often the only means by which Americans learn about Islam which communicates a skewed image of the religion LloydMoffett said PERIOD

People were introduced to Islam through an act of terrorism particularly through the Taliban he said PERIOD So when people were initially educated about Islam after  the Taliban became Islam PERIOD The Taliban was antiwomen antiprogress antieverything so if thats where you learn about Islam thats what you get PERIOD Its like learning about Christianity from a white supremacist group in the South PERIOD If thats your only experience youre going to have a pretty warped view of it. people who hold this view tend to use Muslim extremism and selectively violent passages from the Quran as evidence that Islam promotes violence LloydMoffett said PERIOD In reality violent Muslim extremists account for a negligible fraction of the Muslim population and the Qurans violent texts are usually used outofcontext PERIOD

There seems to be an assumption grounded in a general ignorance of Islam that these isolated texts you pull out must be the center he said PERIOD But when you pull out similar texts from Christianity and Judaism people just say Thats only applicable to the time and place. almost all major religions have some violent elements in their sacred texts LloydMoffett said PERIOD

I dont think theres anything in the Islamic tradition that would advocate violence more than other traditions he said PERIOD And historically speaking Christians have killed many more than Muslims ever have PERIOD But were at an era of development in Islam where theyre really struggling to figure out how they fit into the world and part of the reaction to those developments has been this fundamentalist extremist element. kolkailah emphasized that in Islam it is never okay to kill innocent people PERIOD However the violent actions of a few Muslim extremists have come to represent Islam as a whole PERIOD

Recently after the Charlie Hebdo tragedy as I walked around campus I could tell whos been watching the news and scapegoating Muslims she said PERIOD You can see in peoples eyes the way they narrow their eyes at me and look at me as if Im somehow personally responsible for what these crazy people did halfway across the world. lloydMoffett said those who want to learn more about Islam should simply talk to a Muslim about the faith PERIOD

Muslims are in a different place because Christians dont need to explain their religion to anyone he said PERIOD Muslims are in a place where since  theyve spent a decade explaining their religion to everybody PERIOD And most of them are pretty good PERIOD They welcome it. a previous version of this story said the list was of four misconceptions not five PERIOD

 Comments

It would be great if the Muslim Student Association would spend less time defending their faith and more time explaining why throughout the world innocent men women and children are being murdered raped and forced to flee their homes  by those professing allegiance to Islam PERIOD

You missed the point PERIOD People use religion to justify their actions PERIOD They are power hungry assholes PERIOD They use the religion to get people to come to their cause and then corrupt them to partake in murder rape and war PERIOD

Of course they are power hungry assholes PERIOD  You missed my point why do so many of them represent themselves as emmisaries of Islam  Why not Buddhism Hinduism Protestantism  The numbers are overwhelming PERIOD  Why  I want the members of the MSA to confront this reality PERIOD

Dude so did the crusaders but we dont go blaming christians nowadays for the crusades PERIOD MSA has no responsibility to confront that false reality PERIOD

Thats like saying Catholics have no responsibility for getting to the root of pedophelia in their clergy PERIOD

The Catholic church is a business that can control the actions of its clergy by defrocking excommunicating and disowning those they employ PERIOD The Muslim community cannot fire ISIS PERIOD

Yes the Catholic hierarchy has primary responsibility PERIOD  But Im sure many Catholics over the ages were aware of the abuse of children in their midst and said and did nothing PERIOD  Similarly young Muslims are being radicalized right in front of their friends and families frequently in mosques PERIOD  When Muslims become aware of this they have a chance to step up say No that is wrong andor report potentially violent behavior to the authorities PERIOD  We cannot rely on church leaders of any faith to be the sole guardians of wrong behavior PERIOD
