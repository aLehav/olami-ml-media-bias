The Biden Administration named UT computer science professor William Press as an advisor on the Presidents Council for Science and Technology which they say will prioritize the use of scientific data in policymaking PERIOD

Press was one of  scientists named as a member of the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD He previously served as the vicechair of the council under the Obama administration and is the only member to serve on both presidents councils besides Eric Lander President Joe Bidens science advisor PERIOD

In January Biden wrote a letter to the council about the importance of basing decisions on scientific data PERIOD The letter said the council will focus on five main things including the COVID19 pandemic climate change and the longterm health of science and technology PERIOD

Press said he was honored to be named a member of the council PERIOD

I think its very important that the group consult outside experts on these issues find out what is the consensus of the scientific community broadly including the industrial community and then make recommendations that really have some sticking power Press said PERIOD

The council held its first meetings on Sept PERIOD  and . allowing outside experts to share their knowledge on the areas of focus Press said PERIOD

Its not easy to solve just by a presidential directive Press said PERIOD Part of the problem is that the actual responsibility for public health is not a federal responsibility PERIOD It resides in the states and then it is delegated down locally. stephen Jones Jr. who worked with Press as a postdoctoral researcher said Press will be a valuable member of the Presidents council because of his wellrounded scientific knowledge PERIOD

Hes been doing this for years and years and he still maintains that level of excitement Jones Jr PERIOD said PERIOD Part of it is because hes always working at the edges right at the frontier so thats an exciting place to be  He doesnt shy away from those frontiers. ilya Finkelstein a molecular biosciences associate professor who has worked with Press for about five years said Press has a broad understanding of science which allows him to make unique contributions to multiple scientific fields PERIOD

People like Press will be making excellent recommendations to the policymakers to make sure that the most people get equitable access to these kinds of technologies and that we continue to fuel the engine of our economies with these breakthrough fields for many years to come Finkelstein said PERIOD
