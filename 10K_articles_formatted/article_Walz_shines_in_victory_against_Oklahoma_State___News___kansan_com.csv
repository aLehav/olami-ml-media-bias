Though Kansas   offense put on an impressive display in a  victory against Oklahoma State it was junior pitcher T.J PERIOD Walz who stole the show PERIOD

Walz dominated the Cowboys right from the start and took a nohitter into the ninth inning PERIOD But Duren Davis led off the ninth with a ground ball to deep shortstop and legged it out for an infield single PERIOD

 Walz said PERIOD 

The next batter also reached on a single and Walz came out of the game just shy of making Kansas baseball history PERIOD The Cowboys were able to score three runs two earned in the ninth to deny Walz a shutout  but it wasnt enough to mar his stellar outing PERIOD

Walz finished the evening with a seasonhigh  strikeouts and stopped a streak of three straight blowout losses suffered by the Jayhawks PERIOD

With the way Walz pitched the Jayhawks wouldnt need much offense  though they delivered plenty of it PERIOD Every Kansas starter tallied at least one of  total hits including four apiece by center fielder Brian Heere shortstop Brandon Macias and third baseman Tony Thompson PERIOD

After tallying five straight hits to jump out to a  lead in the third inning Kansas tacked on three more runs in the fifth on RBI hits by right fielder Casey Lytle and left fielder Jimmy Waters PERIOD

The Jayhawks put the game away in the seventh when they then sent  men to the plate en route to scoring seven more runs PERIOD

But with the way Walz was pitching he didnt need the extra run support PERIOD Though his nohit bid came up short Walz said he was simply happy to earn a muchneeded victory PERIOD

 Walz said PERIOD
