First shothurled inpizza war

The names Beltz PERIOD Im a pizza delivery driver.The jobs never been easy terrible road conditionslate hours and ungrateful customers.But things are about to get worse PERIOD Much much worse.Employees of a newlyopened pizza place were seenrecently in the parking lot of a rival pizza place passingout employment fliers to the drivers of that establishment.Thats how something like this always starts.They were there for recruitment to try to draw peopleover to their side of the lines and support their cause.Thus the lines are drawn for the inevitable pizza war.It always starts with something subtle like that butthe pebble has hit the water and the ripples shalleventually be felt all over the pizzasnarfing pond.Next lies the  stage where pizzaplaces deluge one another with prank calls for massive pilesof pizzas to be delivered to local Jenny Craig locations.Cities will burn world powers will rise and fall andstill the pizza war shall escalate.The point of no return will come when that one timidpizza driver  the one who has always spoken softly anddone hisher job well  whips out a hand cannon and blowsaway a rival pizza person.After that there will be no more innocent souls.I have already begun to prepare for the ensuingapocalyptic hostilities PERIOD My  Ford Mustang is at thegarage getting refitted for the troubled times ahead.Instead of a sunroof I now have a turreted Vulcanmachine gun loaded with incendiary ammo PERIOD My rusty tailpipehides a flaming oil jet and the front of the car sports aramplate and laserguided rockets.Other features include a radar system targetingcomputer wheelguards and fireproof armor on all sides.No longer can I just wear my pizza shirt and shorts towork something with a bit more beef is necessary PERIOD My bodyarmor is on order PERIOD Already waiting for me in my closet is mybattle vest and assorted weaponry Bowie knife whitephosphorous grenades and a machine gun with laser scope andarmorpiercing ammo.Thus rises the sun on the new era of pizza deliveries.The early morning sun ascends over the eastern horizonadding a subtle brightness to the exhaust fumes hanging inthe air PERIOD Bullet casings burned cheese and dried crusts laystrewn about by the roadside and those immortal words arespoken PERIOD
