Sophomore golfer Patrick Welch practices his swing at the Charlie Coe Golf Learning Center on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Patrick Welch isnt your typical golfer PERIOD

Before coming to Oklahoma Welch was a promising young golfer from Providence Rhode Island who wouldnt back down from anyone PERIOD The short skinny teenager was consistently one of the youngest players on the field at the Rhode Island Junior Amateur Championship where the competition aged up to  years old PERIOD

Bob Goldin caddied for Welch for several tournaments throughout his career and said he remembers one game in particular PERIOD Welch stood on the No PERIOD  tee box with a commanding lead over his match play opponent in the semifinals needing one more win in the finals to take home another Rhode Island Junior Amateur title PERIOD

Why dont you rest up Youve got a tough opponent in the finals.I think youre four or five underI think its seven.Im not quitting  Im going for the course recordI know theres a few other people PERIOD .. PERIOD I know Tiger Woods did itHe started out crosshanded and eventually over time theyll switch PERIOD I just stuck with it.I dont think moving to Rhode Island really affected his golf gameIt might have been a blessing because he got to play basketball he got to play baseball and he got to play golf PERIOD And when one season was over he was hungry for the next one.Golf is for the privileged kidsPatrick didnt have all that PERIOD He didnt have a country club pro he didnt have the golf lessons PERIOD He did it all himself.He was  and my wife was having her second childAnd I would come home from work and shed say Take him And I didnt take him to the park and go to the jungle gym PERIOD I took him to the chipping green.I was like you know Im not gonna argue with a 4yearoldHes got plenty of time to change PERIOD As time went on I was like Hey youve got to switch and he just never wanted to.There would always be some people commenting like You wont hit it as far. they all think theyre an expertBut I was already comfortable enough with it so I didnt feel the need to change.I was pretty selfconscious about it because theres so many traditionalists in golf and if youre doing something different .. PERIOD thats kind of weirdIt never bothered him one bit PERIOD He was so cool but I always took offense .. PERIOD and I still do because everybodys got an opinion on it like He cant do that. well he does it.Its just been a very fun and interesting part of my life to be involved with someone whos that talentedAnd hes made it without the amenities that these kids have these days.Id heard that some coaches wouldnt look at me or wanted to change me if I attended their schoolSo I mean in a way theres a little chip on my shoulder just because I want to prove I can actually play.His mom graduated from NYU born and raised in Philly and we lived in San FranciscoOklahoma might as well have been Russia PERIOD You know what I mean Like Youre going where and I said to his mom You wouldnt believe it PERIOD The people down in Oklahoma are so friendly and the school is so beautiful and Coach Hybl wants him and it was done.I was actually super relaxed that weekMy game felt pretty good I played really well and it gave me a little bit of confidence knowing that I could play with pretty much anyone PERIOD Playing in junior tournaments  knowing those players and gaining that experience I think it helped for the NCAA Championship because I felt like it was just another tournament PERIOD Even though it was the biggest one I felt more at ease knowing that Id been there before.I think thats on everyones mindWeve been there we won a few years ago PERIOD The past few years weve made it to match play but we just werent there at the end PERIOD I think this year weve got a really strong team with Quade Cummins and Garett Reband leading the way. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
