Professor Todd Allen and influencer Isabella Boemeke advocate for nuclear energy in starkly different ways but they are both fighting for our clean energy independence PERIOD Together Allens pragmatism and Boemekes cool factor can lead us into the future PERIOD

Isabella Boemeke identifies herself as the worlds first nuclear energy influencer PERIOD She created the social media identity Isodope for this purpose PERIOD

In her recent TED Talk Boemeke advocates for nuclear energy which she calls our best hope for ditching fossil fuels PERIOD Boemeke describes how all of the relevant experts she talked to about nuclear energy agreed that its good we need it people hate it. while Boemeke takes a more humorous approach to nuclear energy advocacy through sarcasm and the use of popular TikTok trends in her videos she provides a lot of the same arguments as the technical experts pursuing the same goal PERIOD

Todd Allen is a professor and chair of the nuclear engineering  radiological sciences department at the University of Michigan PERIOD Unlike Boemeke Allen takes a pragmatic approach to advocacy PERIOD

Allen has pursued becoming an advocate of nuclear energy because he wanted access to public discussions and wanted to make sure were not leaving out possible choices that would help us diversify energy sources to protect from cost or availability fluctuations PERIOD

Allen noted that nuclear energy plants currently produce  of U.S PERIOD electricity which is currently more than  of the zerocarbon sources PERIOD

So what are the arguments for nuclear energy according to these advocates

Nuclear energy is clean efficient and safe

When developing cleaner energy sources the levels of carbon emissions how clean the fuel is efficiency and safety must all be considered PERIOD

You get no carbon dioxide emissions as youre producing electricity Allen said of nuclear energy PERIOD This places nuclear energy in a position to be a valuable alternative to fossil fuels right from the start PERIOD

Nuclear has a high energy density so very little fuel input is needed to generate energy PERIOD You compare one nuclear reaction to burning one coal atom to get a billion times more energy so you get way more energy out of a fixed amount of fuel and you also produce far less waste Allen said PERIOD

Nuclear energy is safer than many people have been taught to believe PERIOD Both Allen and Boemeke agree that many people have false assumptions about nuclear energy often because of its association with nuclear weapons PERIOD

As Boemeke says in her TED Talk Their logic was nuclear bombs are bad PERIOD Therefore nuclear energy is bad PERIOD Which if you think about it is like saying the electric chair is bad PERIOD Therefore electricity is bad PERIOD The case against nuclear power was never based on science. boemeke also notes that nuclear energy waste is fully contained in concrete casks that are so good at blocking radiation that I sic might do a photo shoot there. additionally nuclear energy facilities can be built near enough to population centers that they may avoid some of the problems seen with wind and solar energy facilities PERIOD

Often wind and solar facilities are built out in open fields far away from where the electricity is needed PERIOD This results in some loss along the transmission lines and land jurisdiction issues in building and maintaining those transmission lines PERIOD

Allen noted that when building transmission lines difficulties can arise from crossing state lines tribal lands and federal lands PERIOD You may be going through different states who have their own rules and the types of tribal and federal lands there PERIOD Youve got all these different jurisdictions that may end up being part of the pathway he said PERIOD

Wind and solar facilities also take up large amounts of land and only generate electricity when the wind is blowing or the sun is out PERIOD Wind and solar change the way you deliver electricity because theyre coming on and off essentially as the fuel is available Allen said PERIOD

Nuclear energy however can be generated constantly regardless of weather conditions PERIOD

As Boemeke noted in the last  years we have spent trillions of dollars on renewables yet we only get  of our electricity from wind and solar PERIOD Now dont get me wrong PERIOD I love renewables PERIOD But to me its clear that we need more PERIOD We need a source of energy thats clean and works  to complement them. nuclear energy could mean energy independence

If the conflict in Ukraine has reminded us of anything in the past several months it is that energy independence and diverse reliable energy sources are critical to maintaining the security and financial health of nations PERIOD

We can plainly see that dependence on fossil fuels can contribute to and fund wars PERIOD Europe is currently suffering an energy crisis due to its dependence on Russian fossil fuels in the midst of the invasion of Ukraine PERIOD European countries are beholden to buying Russian oil while simultaneously supporting Ukraines resistance PERIOD

Boemeke noted Poland will use similar technology to convert their aging coal plants into nuclear plants theyll use the same building the same transmission lines even retrain the same workers but now make clean energy instead of buying dirty fuels from dictators. the United States currently has  nuclear plants in operation PERIOD However we could build more and develop a mutually beneficial model for ourselves and our allies abroad who have weaker economies or fewer resources PERIOD

The United States could invest in nuclear energy domestically to help reduce our carbon emissions and sell natural gas abroad to provide a cleaner fuel to other countries and therefore reduce carbon emissions abroad as well PERIOD

This could allow for clean energy independence not to mention the potential for job and economic growth PERIOD

Nuclear energy could provide political common ground

In an era of seemingly complete political divide on party lines nuclear energy could provide some common ground in the political arena that we have not seen in a long time PERIOD

Congress members across party lines have begun to show agreement on the move to nuclear energy PERIOD Allen noted there was a recent nuclear energy bill in Congress that had four sponsors including Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse RI and Cory Booker NJ and Republicans Mike Crapo ID and James Inhofe OK PERIOD

Allen noted the reasons for supporting this bill are likely different in each case PERIOD Whitehouse is fighting for climate change goals while Booker is focused on the health risks of coal PERIOD Crapo is representing a state that is very supportive of nuclear energy and Inhofe who is usually in opposition to Whitehouse supported this bill out of interest in American energy competitiveness and jobs PERIOD

With so many arguments that serve so many people from different political viewpoints could nuclear energy be the political unifier we have been looking for

As Boemeke said What if instead of viewing nuclear power as destructive we view it as a force for energy independence and even peace What if this technology offers our best hope for the future A future where wars arent funded by our addiction to fossil fuels PERIOD A future where energy is clean PERIOD A future where electricity finally makes its way to the  million people on Earth who still dont have access to it PERIOD The idea that nuclear power is bad is costing us that future PERIOD And its time to let go of it. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
