When freshman diver Anna Filipcic walked into the University of Minnesotas Aquatic Center on March  she hoped all would go according to plan when it came to her 3meter dive PERIOD

Watching all the competitors dive before her Filipcic waited for her turn to nail what she had practiced PERIOD Once it was her turn Filipcic dove her second best score of . pERIOD Knowing that this dive could secure her spot in the NCAA Championships Filipcic watched her last competitor receive a score lower than her own PERIOD

In that moment the competitors coaches turned to congratulate her on the fourthplace finish and a spot in the NCAA Championships PERIOD

Filipcic grew up in Omaha where she attended Omaha Burke High School and was an AllAmerican in  PERIOD She placed in numerous statewide competitions during her four years there PERIOD Filipcic didnt start diving until about seventh grade after she started to transition out of competing in gymnastics and tumbling PERIOD

When I was younger I started out in gymnastics Filipcic said PERIOD I started out in the basic recreational gymnastics when I was  and I started being more competitive when I was about  or so PERIOD I kind of did that until about seventh grade. filipcic also competed in tumbling and trampolines but because of the hassle of driving out of state to attend competitions she started to put her energy into diving instead during her eighthgrade year PERIOD

Since then Filipcic has competed on both her high school diving team and a club team PERIOD During her time in high school Filipcic placed second in the 1meter dive with a score of . at the Nebraska High School State Championships in  PERIOD

The Husker diver also dove for the Nebraska Dive Club PERIOD She received a secondplace finish at the  Junior Nationals and a fifthplace result at the  Junior West Nationals for her 1meter dives PERIOD Not to mention she was also a Junior Zone champion in both the  and 3meter dives in  and  PERIOD

Even before she knew she would attend Nebraska Filipcic knew she had to consider coming to the school not only because she lived in the Cornhusker state but also because of the familiarity of the schools diving team PERIOD

Being a Nebraska native it was something that I automatically had to consider Filipcic said PERIOD It felt like it would be a really smooth transition and I think being able to have the diving team as something that I already kind of knew while coming to a new environment would be really helpful. besides being a competitive athlete for Nebraska Filipcic also is the only music major on the Husker team PERIOD The Husker diver started playing the French horn in grade school and has loved playing the instrument ever since PERIOD

At my elementary school you were required to play the violin in second grade she said PERIOD In fifth grade you could pick a band instrument if you wanted and I dont know why but for some reason I just knew I wanted to play the French horn PERIOD It just looked so cool. even with the responsibilities she has as a student athlete Filipcic according to her coach achieves a great balance between the two PERIOD

Shes really determined really talented and when she sets her goal she will go for that goal diving coach Natasha Chikina said PERIOD Besides being a good athlete and a good diver shes also a good friend and student. filipcics teammates also agree on how determined she is on setting her goals PERIOD

I think that shes a really hard worker and shes really driven senior diver Payton Michaud said PERIOD She has a lot of high goals for herself and she loves to set out to accomplish them PERIOD Shes one of the funniest people but shes also really serious about what she does PERIOD Shes also pretty inspirational because shes a freshman that made NCAA for the first time and no one else has on the team so thats pretty cool. filipcic is the first Husker diver to qualify and compete in the NCAA Championships since Amie Buoy placed eighteenth in the 3meter dive in  PERIOD

I am so excited Filipcic said PERIOD Im also honored because its a big competition with a lot of really good divers PERIOD Its going to be exciting just to be there and see what everyone else is doing. filipcic will be competing in both the  and 3meter dives in the NCAA Championship competition set for March  at the University of Minnesotas Aquatic Center PERIOD
