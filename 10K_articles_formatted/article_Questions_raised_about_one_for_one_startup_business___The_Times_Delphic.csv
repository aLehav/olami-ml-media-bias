On Jan PERIOD  four Drake students launched an ambitious startup business called Make Your Mark PERIOD
The company was featured in the TimesDelphic and has gained substantial publicity within the Drake community PERIOD

The project surely has good intentions but as many international development experts have noted good intentions dont always matter PERIOD
Make Your Mark is similar to the oneforone model in which purchasing a backpack will theoretically guarantee the education of a child in a developing nation. a child gets an education and you get to feel great about yourself and your new backpack PERIOD

Clearly its a winwin for everyone right

Not quite PERIOD The complications of traditional aid can be illustrated by numerous organizations but TOMS shoes perhaps has the most parallels to Make Your Mark PERIOD

While TOMS was also started with very noble intentions their business model does not address the disparate root causes of poverty in the various developing nations they operate in PERIOD

Rather TOMS needs poor children without shoes in order to keep selling shoes PERIOD

TOMS has since adjusted their model PERIOD They sell eyewear serve as a marketplace place for nongovernmental organizationss to sell local products and they recently built a manufacturing site in Haiti PERIOD

Regardless TOMS initial illeducated impact resulted from a lack of deep local knowledge and a critical understanding of development PERIOD

When a child or person is simply handed a good or service it takes away from the demand of that product or service PERIOD

Oftentimes this takes a job away from a community member PERIOD

TOMS came to this realization and has since started manufacturing shoes in countries where they distribute starting with Haiti PERIOD This investment has boosted Haitis economy and empowered communities PERIOD

Whats the important lesson here Outside intervention especially from the Western world can sometimes do more harm than good PERIOD Development projects cannot succeed without local understanding partnerships and empowerment PERIOD

We fear this is exactly where Make Your Mark may be making a similar mistake PERIOD

The organization repeatedly reports on their media sites that it wishes to work in Africa and has singled out Zimbabwe Burkina Faso and Uganda simply for their low literacy rates PERIOD

Despite any solidified plans to operate on the continent MYM contributes to the alltoocommon white savior complex by stating its wishes to save Africa thus perpetuating the stereotype that Africa needs to be saved PERIOD

While aspiring to improve our world and achieve educational equality is an admirable goal it establishes a problematic power dynamic between those offering help and those receiving help PERIOD

It also fails to acknowledge global political and economic systems that sustain inequality PERIOD

We do not intend to demean or discourage our fellow students from philanthropic or humanitarian efforts PERIOD Rather we challenge you to seek understanding before you seek to help PERIOD

We challenge you to learn before making promises such as the eradication of poverty and the guarantee of an education PERIOD

We challenge you to think critically about the way you are representing Africa Belize and the other communities you wish to work in PERIOD

We challenge you to approach global educational inequality from a position of solidarity and human dignity not charity PERIOD

Some critics such as Dambisa Moyo author of Dead Aid believe that traditional aid should be cut out entirely PERIOD

Moyos belief comes from the idea that governments should seek money from financial markets and banks and companies should invest in these developing communities not always simply give them handouts PERIOD

Organizations such as Kiva Acumen and the Grameen Bank are pursuing poverty alleviation with similar ideologies and models PERIOD

While others believe in the educated dispersal of cold hard cash the dispersal must be through the collaboration of local understanding PERIOD

The model set up by Drakes very own Make Your Mark reflects a similar misunderstanding where so many have gone wrong PERIOD

MYM aims to allow for their partners to dictate where the money needs to be spent rather than the imperialistic path that has been so popular in the past PERIOD

As Joy Sun spells out in her October  TED talk cash can often be the most effective form of aid PERIOD

Local people themselves know how best to use resources PERIOD

While the world of development is fraught with complications one thing is for certain Western solutions do not work for nonWestern problems PERIOD

Next time you think of jumping on the charity bandwagon we urge you to not just buy but to understand PERIOD

We ask you to consider thinking about where your dollars and shoes are really going PERIOD Understand the implications of your actions PERIOD

Realize that you are a contributor to the world big or small PERIOD

As college students and global citizens we have a responsibility to the world PERIOD

We are the next generation PERIOD Allow yourselves to use your education for good PERIOD

Take the beautiful opportunity you were given in the form of a higher education and make a positive mark on the world PERIOD



Great article ladies PERIOD Fantastic point that needed to be heard PERIOD

It reminded me of Drake Footballs trip to Egypt in   they built houses in a country with an overwhelmingly high rate of unemployment PERIOD Great surface value charity plus the whole feel good thing  publicity but every swing of the hammer is someones job PERIOD Not to say that there arent individuals in the area living without shelter but this offers relatively no sustainability or bettering of the community once they pack up and fly home PERIOD Surely there must have been a better way to allocate those resources than  plane tickets for a week of unskilled manual labor PERIOD

There is a great Latin saying that is used in emergency medicine and it translates beautifully to aide  development nil nocere meaning first do no harm PERIOD
