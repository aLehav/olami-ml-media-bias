Tiffany SalamehOctober  

Face impeachment or remove yourself voluntarily Those were the two choices Attorney general Jaclyn Glosson gave Student Government President Samantha Mims Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Glosson called Mims inattentive and negligent of her duties as President in an email sent to SG student and professional staff PERIOD Mims made the choice to remove herself from the position stepping down as Student Government President Monday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

According to Glosson multiple student government projects have been delayed or halted due to Mims inattentiveness PERIOD Important relationships outside of student government have also suffered because of Mims negligence to perform her required duties PERIOD

Both professional and student staff myself included have voiced their concerns with the hope of compelling you to perform your presidential duties Glosson said PERIOD

Another problem with Mims performance as president as outlined in the email was her inability to communicate with internal SG staff PERIOD Glosson said student staff has needed to compensate for Mims due to her inability to communicate and her lack of responsiveness PERIOD



At the beginning of your term these mistakes were understandable given the high learning curve of your position Glosson said PERIOD Now however they have accumulated in such a way to adversely affect the UNF student body. at the end of the email Glosson addressed the necessity of Mims removal from office and said that the student body and student government are actively suffering PERIOD Mims was given until Oct PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD to make a decision to either remove herself from her position or face the chaotic and dramatic process of impeachment. glosson said in the email that she hoped Mims would leave office voluntarily and work on learning from her mistakes PERIOD

Mimss sent her letter of resignation to the student body at  p.m PERIOD Monday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD You can read her full statement here PERIOD
