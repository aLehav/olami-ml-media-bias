For my last hurrah as Edge Editor Im going to be a little selfish PERIOD Instead of giving you a genrespanning list of this weeks releases I want to share the songs that have defined my last four years in college PERIOD

The Hotelier  An Introduction to the Album

Im giving you An Introduction to the Album but I implore you to listen to the rest PERIOD Home Like Noplace is There is the perfect storm of catharsis regret and uncertainty PERIOD Ive been a longtime consumer of emotive hardcore but The Hoteliers second LP is a standout for me in its poeticism dynamics and arrangement PERIOD Its rough its evocative and its one of the only albums that is capable of making me cry PERIOD

Sorority Noise  A Portrait Of

Theres something bittersweet in how triumphant A Portrait Of is  the lyrics about self doubt and suffering are ironically juxtaposed with group vocals and soaring guitar lines cynical quips at God and the typical poppunk chugging strum PERIOD These choices make a compelling statement about the universality of personal struggle and as the repeated line claims Im not trying to say its easy Im trying to say that its fine. nothing but Thieves  Drawing Pins

Whether or not youve fallen victim to unrequited love Drawing Pins will make your skin crawl with its portrayal of desperation PERIOD Conor Masons vocal range matches the dynamics of the music climbing from the low whispering verse over a sparse bass line to the screamed chorus over a full rush of guitars PERIOD

Black Pistol Fire  Storm Cussin

Both times Ive seen Black Pistol Fire live Kevin McKeown smashed a guitar and dove into the crowd  once I caught his left ankle PERIOD Kevin McKeowns gruff vocals and dirtySouth guitar lines and Eric Owens smashing guitar hits are all it takes for this twopiece to light a fire PERIOD BPF remains my favorite band to stream over an angry weightlifting session PERIOD

Royal Blood  I Only Lie When I Love You

Did I say angry Royal Blood another bluesy twopiece might beat out Black Pistol Fire in that category PERIOD How Did We Get So Dark is a seething reel of breakup songs that has fueled my deadlifts since April  PERIOD I think I hate Mike Kerrs ex almost as much as he does PERIOD

PUP  If This Tour Doesnt Kill You I Will

Clearly the members of PUP harbored a lot of animosity toward each other back in  when they performed more than  consecutive gigs PERIOD With the caffeinated energy of a modern poppunk song If This Tour Doesnt Kill You I Will calls back to the genres roots when songs were lighthearted comedic and a little offensive PERIOD

Broadside  Storyteller

Ive coined a term for bands like Broadside State Champs Issues and Neck Deep PopPopPunk PERIOD Unlike gruffer PUP and its lovably sloppy predecessors bands like Broadside boast squeakyclean production refined vocals and traditional pop song structures PERIOD Call it inauthentic but I think the precision of its sound makes PopPopPunk particularly evocative PERIOD Theres a knot in my chest every time I hear  the chorus of Storyteller  Im not a liar maybe a storyteller

Microwave  Whimper

Before you listen to Whimper listen to all of Microwaves Much Love. actually listen to the full album for each of these tracks  I firmly believe that is the best way to consume music PERIOD Like so many of the picks on the list Whimper is a vignette of a much longer and more complex narrative played out over the  tracks on Much Love. i am endlessly impressed by Microwaves wit literary lyrics and ability to cohesively blend hardcore and softer emo styles PERIOD

Slothrust  Horseshoe Crab



Thats not a man singing  thats Leah Wellbaum PERIOD One of the most sultry seething lyricists and ripping guitarists in the contemporary rock scene Leah fronts Slothrust like she doesnt need the band PERIOD As a poet I laud Leah for her imagery and ability to inject poeticism into her songs without it feeling forced PERIOD

Phoebe Bridgers  Funeral

For me and many other musicians writers and music consumers  was the year of Phoebe PERIOD In her debut album Stranger in the Alps the Los Angelesbased singersongwriter carries you through a narrative of her personal life recounting twisted relationships depression and thoughts of suicide over a background of subtle strings and electric guitar PERIOD Shes contemplative shes witty shes grateful  everything one would hope to be at   but shes also struggling and doesnt romanticize a thing about it PERIOD The lyrical content of Stranger in the Alps is as sickening as it is comforting and coupled with its sparse arrangement has earned its place among the most powerful works Ive encountered in college PERIOD

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD","Edge Weekly Finale: Editorâ€™s picks, the college years - The Miami Hurricane",University of Miami
