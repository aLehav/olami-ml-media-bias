A fast start to the soccer season has been followed by a quick decline PERIOD The mens soccer team lost both of its games this weekend and dropped to  on the season PERIOD After a  start the Cats have only won one of their last  going  PERIOD

Tuesdays contest against Layayette started well for the Wildcats as freshman Craig Moscetti netted his first goal of the year PERIOD Two second half goals by Lafayette however gave the Leopards their eleventh win of the season PERIOD Fatigue played a major role in the game as Villanovas starters were forced to play extra minutes due to injuries PERIOD Leading scorer Dan DeMasters was sidelined after an injury suffered on Saturday and Marcelo Rodriguez was out as well PERIOD

Head Coach Larry Sullivan was visibly dissappointed after the contest and cited lack of depth as a problem during the game PERIOD

Saturdays game against West Virginia was dominated by the Wildcats but a quick goal just  minutes into play held up for the Mountaineers PERIOD

It was the most that we have dominated a team all season we just couldnt find the net senior Mike Altschuler said PERIOD

Villanova could still miss the cut for the Big East tournament if they do not play well on Saturday PERIOD A decisive game against Syracuse  should determine their postseason situation PERIOD

At this point we need to make the Big East tournament hopefully we can turn things around and make something happen from there Sullivan said of the teams goals for the rest of the season PERIOD

If the Cats are able to get back on the winning track they may have an outside chance at making the NCAA tournament although they would still need to win their next two games and have a great showing in the Big East tourney PERIOD

The game against Syracuse is on Saturday at  p.m PERIOD The Cats will wrap up the regular season on Wednesday against Penn State at  p.m PERIOD at the West Campus Soccer Complex PERIOD
