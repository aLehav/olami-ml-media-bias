There is word of an approved state budget that wont severely affect University of Connecticut tuition or result in staff layoffs according to Executive Vice President for Administration and Chief Financial Officer Scott Jordan who met with Undergraduate Student Government senators at the USG Senate meeting Wednesday night PERIOD

Im hearing that there was a handshake deal today and Im hearing that UConn wont be cut that badly Jordan said PERIOD

While he was hesitant to confirm any deal Jordan discussed the fact that the initial proposed cut of  million wont be imposed PERIOD According to Jordan the decided cut wont be extremely detrimental to the university PERIOD

Jordan presented the expenditure and revenue of the university breaking down the percentages of the state budget that go to each expense PERIOD He also discussed the potential passing of the budget for UConn PERIOD

According to the finance reports a large percentage of the current budget goes to Personal Services which includes salaries of the faculty and staff of the university PERIOD

In order to reduce the expenses spent on Personal Services UConn has imposed a selective hiring freeze in which they are not bringing in any new staff members Jordan said PERIOD

This will have little effect on the current semester but according to Jordan UConn typically has a turnover of  faculty or staff every year and those who leave at the end of the school year will not be replaced in order to cut the schools spending PERIOD

In the latest State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition SEBAC Agreement approved earlier this year unions representing UConns staff agreed upon reduced health care benefits and no pay raises as a way to reduce the budget in exchange for no staff layoffs according to Jordan PERIOD

The majority of the UConn staff is a part of a union with only  individuals choosing to not be a part of one so this agreement was decided on by a majority of the universitys faculty Jordan said PERIOD

Another effort to reduce university spending is being made in every department PERIOD UConn ordered each of the departments to cut their spending by three percent and so far this has been achieved Jordan said PERIOD

USG Senators had a chance to ask Jordan about the budget itself and the effect it will have on UConn PERIOD The senators focused on tuition asking how the approved budget cuts would affect the yearly cost of attendance and what the tuition money is used for PERIOD

Tuition is expected to rise in the coming years according to Jordan although he believes the raise wont be a devastating amount PERIOD There is already a plan set in place for the coming years Jordan said PERIOD

We hope the tuition goes up only a modest amount Jordan said PERIOD

Jordan confirmed that the majority of tuition goes right to services for students PERIOD

Tuition and state money is mostly used for curricular experience PERIOD Fees are used for only that intended purpose Jordan said PERIOD

One proposed plan is to include the cost of the universitys technology such as WiFi into the tuition cost according to Jordan PERIOD

The conversation then turned to how budget cuts would affect UConns branch campuses PERIOD

If it was the cut that was suggested a few weeks ago wed have to make big decisions about the branches Jordan said PERIOD But if the budget Im hearing about passes we should still evaluate everything we do but it wouldnt be as dire. big construction projects such as the new Recreation Center were also discussed PERIOD According to Jordan all plans for future construction are still in place and students planning to graduate before the opening of these buildings dont have to worry about the construction cost for those projects PERIOD

Fees for construction are only charged to those who will be able to use it PERIOD For example the new Rec Center isnt being paid for yet Jordan said PERIOD Students will start being charged in . the Senate wrapped up with announcements about a Town Hall meeting Monday Oct PERIOD  to discuss club funding for this year PERIOD The meeting is open to all students PERIOD
