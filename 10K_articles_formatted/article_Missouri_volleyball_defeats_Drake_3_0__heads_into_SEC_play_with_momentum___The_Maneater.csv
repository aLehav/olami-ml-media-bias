Missouri volleyball finished the Mizzou Invitational with a  sweep of Drake on Saturday at Hearnes Center PERIOD

The Tigers started the match very sloppily falling behind  and lacking any cohesion on serve receive but they clawed their way back and won  PERIOD Coach Wayne Kreklow played an instrumental part as his challenge overturned what was initially Drakes match tying point at  but instead gave his team a  lead PERIOD

The next two sets were much more straightforward with Missouri winning each one  PERIOD The Tigers posted  kills and a . hitting percentage while limiting Drake to a . hitting percentage and forcing  attacking errors from the Bulldogs PERIOD

That first game kind of reminded me of two fighters in the ring Kreklow said PERIOD Youre trying to figure out whats going on and get a feel for who youre playing against PERIOD I thought that was the story of game one PERIOD We made a few too many unforced errors but I thought we did a really good job at the end of making plays when we had to to close that one out PERIOD Thats always a big one especially at home PERIOD If you can get that first one it gives you an advantage moving forward PERIOD From there we got a good feel for how to block their attackers PERIOD We just slowly but surely got a little bit cleaner and executed better as the match went on. one of the keys to Missouris eventual control of the match was sophomore and player of the tournament Leketor MemberMeneh who finished with nine kills and a . hitting percentage as well as three blocks PERIOD

Shes made such huge strides since last year when she was simply a loose cannon Kreklow said PERIOD Shes much more disciplined shes hitting smarter shots shes blocking better PERIOD I was really pleased with her hustlethat just rubs off on everybody PERIOD If you can have somebody with her talent working that hard and setting that kind of example that really is good for the group. another important performance came in the form of freshman Brynn Paumen who was introduced for her first collegiate home match during the second set PERIOD The 6foot2inch middle recorded her first kill for the Tigers but more importantly she provided six of the teams  total blocks PERIOD

She came in and gave us a nice pickup Kreklow said PERIOD One of the strengths of our team is that we have a lot of depth and it allows us to do some things and make some changes PERIOD Tyanna Omazic who was replaced by Paumen wasnt really doing that bad but we just got into a little funk in that rotation and we thought Were just gonna try another person out there just to see if we can jumpstart things and she came in and did some things well and got us going again and we rode that to the end. saturdays victory came after backtoback wins against Texas AMCorpus Christi and Ohio on Friday and Missouri will now head into Southeastern Conference play with a  record and momentum PERIOD The Tigers next match is against No PERIOD  Alabama at  p.m PERIOD on Wednesday at Hearnes Center PERIOD
