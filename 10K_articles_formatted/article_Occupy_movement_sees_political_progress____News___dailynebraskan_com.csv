The spirit of Occupy Wall Street appears to be translating into political action PERIOD

The movement which began last September coalesced from frustration and anger over the nations historic disparity of wealth and the alleged influence of money on politicians PERIOD It shot the phrase  into the national consciousness and has since cropped up in the State of the Union and the Republican presidential candidate contest PERIOD

Two proposals one in Congress and one making its way around the country seem to echo those cries against the power of money and could change the rules on political spending and taxes PERIOD

Citizens United and the Move to Amend

In  the U.S PERIOD Supreme Courts Citizens United decision said spending money on political ads and other material is effectively speech and deserves First Amendment protection PERIOD Unions corporations or any other organizations could spend however much what they wanted on campaign ads from then on PERIOD

The decision was criticized for the influence it gives to wealthy Americans and corporations which tend to support Republicans PERIOD It paved the way for  to accept unlimited millions in donations and buy political ads usually for one candidate in particular PERIOD So far theyve spend more than  million according to returns filed early this week PERIOD

 said John Gruhl a political science professor at the University of NebraskaLincoln PERIOD 

Citizens United has frequently been a point of protest from Occupy Wall Street PERIOD City by city an associated movement called  is trying to build momentum for a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision PERIOD

Los Angeles New York City Portland and several other cities and towns across the country have already adopted a resolution in support PERIOD During the past month Occupy Lincoln has been calling on the city council to do the same PERIOD

 said Jo Tetherow  a retired real estate appraiser who has been a sort of matriarch for the Occupy Lincoln camp on Centennial Mall PERIOD

So far the councils reaction has been lukewarm but Tetherow said the people of Lincoln support the idea PERIOD Interviews with several UNL students suggested the same PERIOD

 said Josh Doeden a freshman political science and international studies major PERIOD 

Sherae Sawyer a sophomore broadcasting major said she supported overturning the decision to allow candidates into politics without the wealth or following of Republican candidates Mitt Romney or Rick Santorum PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

But a constitutional amendment requires the support of twothirds of Congress or the states making it extremely difficult to push through PERIOD

 Gruhl said PERIOD 

High Earnings and Low Taxes

In another echo of a common Occupy Wall Street protest a bill was introduced to the U.S PERIOD Senate Wednesday that aims to equalize the tax burden across income levels PERIOD

The socalled   named after Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett who supports it  would require millionaires pay an income tax rate of at least  percent to bring their taxes more in line with most earners PERIOD

As Buffett has often pointed out his income tax rate is about  percent PERIOD His secretary on the other hand makes a fraction of Buffetts income but pays a percentage about twice as high PERIOD Buffett and others have taken up the call to change that imbalance between high and middle income PERIOD

Like most tax issues theres no simple reason for the lopsided rates PERIOD First income more than  isnt subject to payroll taxes which fund programs like Medicare PERIOD Second wealthier people tend to make more of their income from investment such as buying a stock and selling it at a higher price for profit PERIOD That profit is taxed at a lower rate than regular income PERIOD

 said Seth Giertz an economics assistant professor who specializes in tax issues PERIOD

Like many critics of the proposal Giertz pointed to corporate income taxes which are often about  percent and take a chunk out of stocks prices even before theyre bought and sold PERIOD Congressional Republicans have been solidly against turning the income tax dial up to  casting serious doubt on whether the proposal can survive PERIOD

 said Elizabeth TheissMorse chairwoman of UNLs Political Science Department PERIOD The majority of the public seems to support raising taxes on the highest earners she said but the issue has become a matter of principle for the Republicans she said PERIOD

 Gruhl said PERIOD 

Cutting government revenue is a way of choking off and shrinking a government Republicans think is too big Gruhl added PERIOD But months of reports of public workers and teachers fired services cut and infrastructure suffering may have pushed the public away from that idea PERIOD

 Gruhl said PERIOD
