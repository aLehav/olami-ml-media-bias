Scheduling is similar to a game of Tetris PERIOD Students search through an expansive array of classes in order to find the courses that best fit together to create an intellectually stimulating yet manageable schedule PERIOD

The Program

The College of Arts and Sciences has recentlycreated and developed a Peer Mentor Program PERIOD The program consists of several carefully selected students from a wide range of disciplines within the College of Arts and Sciences PERIOD

Last semester the Deans Student Advisory Committee for the College of Arts and Sciences decided that the development of a Peer Mentor Program would supplement faculty advising in younger students academic planning PERIOD

The program facilitates the direct communication amongst students whose interests are not yet defined and a Peer Mentor who can lend his or her experiential perspective on academic career planning PERIOD

Experience in mentorship

Currently there are three mentors that have been hired for each division of the College of Arts and Sciences Social Sciences Arts and Humanities and Math and the Sciences PERIOD

All of the Peer Mentors that were hired have a wide variety of lived experiences interests extracurriculars and academic paths while at Bucknell Executive Intern to the Dean of the College of Arts and SciencesMax Fathauer 18said PERIOD

The student advising program was started to create a liaison between the faculty advisors and the student body PERIOD Our purpose is to provide thoughtful advice and guidance about classes majors and career paths  student to student PERIOD With our CCC system weve all taken classes in various departments and with our knowledge and experience about what the different courses are like can help give suggestions for what may work best in the schedules of the students we work with Humanities Peer Mentor Izzy Wisen  said PERIOD

Mentoring began the first week of classes as to provide students with the opportunity to speak with a peer about schedule editing within the time frame of the adddrop period PERIOD

Although there are no Peer Mentors for the College of Engineering nor the College of Management the College of Arts and Sciences peers are willing to lend their experience with the academic resources on campus PERIOD At the semesters conclusion the Deans Student Advisory Committee for the College of Arts and Sciences will closely assess the programs success and share data with the other colleges with the hopes that the program can be greater developed in future semesters PERIOD

Im looking forward to being able to relate my personal experiences to the interests of students who can benefit from them Social Sciences Peer Mentor Melody Sonnemann  said PERIOD

Fathauer alongside fellow executive intern Kafilat Oladiran  created the program PERIOD

Our favorite part of the program so far has undoubtedly been working with the newly hired Peer Mentors PERIOD Bucknells faculty do a fantastic job assisting and educating students throughout their academic careers here PERIOD Despite their hard work however a new environment will always be stressful and difficult to navigate at first for those fresh to Bucknell PERIOD It has been extremely rewarding from Kafis and my own perspective to develop this program in order to empower newer Bucknellians towards confidence in their academic career during their four years hereFathauer said PERIOD

Spreading the word

All mentor sessions are held in 210Carnegie and in addition to walkin hours students can also schedule appointments PERIOD Depending on where a student may fall in the division within the College of Arts and Sciences different peers are available at different hours Monday through Friday PERIOD

We try to make the student advisers accessible to the students in a way that works well with their schedules so if you have even a small question you can just stop by on your way to wherever youre going PERIOD Come by 210Carnegie PERIOD My hours are Mondays and Tuesdays  Wisen said PERIOD

As it is the programs first semester the mentors are working tirelessly to get the word out about the newly created program PERIOD With the help and experiences of other peer learning leaders on campus including Laura Lanwermeyer Assistant Director of Student Learning Support in The Learning Center the Peer Mentor program hopes to experience great success PERIOD

If you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment with a Peer Mentor contact Fathauer or Oladiran the Executive Interns to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences PERIOD
