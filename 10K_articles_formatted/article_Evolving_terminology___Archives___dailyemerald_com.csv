7657,1970-01-01,"dont tell anyone  and Ill deny it if you ask me  but I confess that I like being a Duck PERIOD Even before Oregon stomped Michigan I would occasionally tell people of the pride I take in my Duckdom PERIOD And while I may occasionally get a quizzical look no one flinches and no one is offended PERIOD It would seem that being a Duck is harmless PERIOD

But what if we werent Ducks

Certainly there are lots of other options PERIOD Were they not already taken we could be nasty and tenacious Wolverines we could be fierce Cougars we could be militant Trojans PERIOD Or we could be Redskins PERIOD

Notice the lack of adjectives PERIOD What do you associate with the term Redskin Personally I dont make any particular associations with the term PERIOD

If asked to define it Id say it is synonymous with American Indian and Native American PERIOD If no one told me otherwise Id have no clue that the term Redskin is offensive to many  particularly if they happen to be of Native American heritage PERIOD

If asked to suggest the origin of the term Id guess that the Europeans who took over this country coined the term in reference to the tans or sunburns sported by the folks who were here first PERIOD That skin would be singled out as an identifying trait isnt surprising nor is it necessarily an indication of inherent racism PERIOD Skin was one area where the differing attributes of the two cultures would be obvious PERIOD After all one culture was not adverse to wearing abbreviated outfits and allowing nature to have her way with their melanin PERIOD The other wore  layers of clothing give or take a few and dusted the few inches of visible skin with powdered lead to eradicate any trace of said melanin PERIOD

Makes sense right Wrong PERIOD

Ive been informed that the term Redskin originally referred to the use by some Native Americans of vermilion paint on their faces PERIOD Ive also been informed that whatever the origin the term went from being a descriptive noun to a valueladen racial epithet PERIOD

So if something was an epithet does that mean that it must always be an epithet

Language is a funny thing it evolves PERIOD Once upon a time our AngloSaxon ancestors used words like fuck and shit without blushing PERIOD Why Because they werent considered profane PERIOD Before they moved into the dreaded fourletterword category they were just words used to describe happenings in the world PERIOD Mark Twain freely sprinkled nigger throughout Huckleberry Finn without intending it to pass judgment on anyones worth as a person PERIOD Even more recently  before Gloria Steinem  a man could call a woman he wasnt dating honey or dear without incurring a dirty look or a lawsuit PERIOD

Times change PERIOD Though fuck is still verboten in most polite situations South Park had an entire episode devoted to seeing how many times they could say shit nigger is not a word any thoughtful person would casually toss around and the man who calls me honey had better be older than seventy or someone whose hand I allow on my knee PERIOD

So what brought all this to mind Last week a federal district court in Washington D.C PERIOD determined that there wasnt enough evidence to establish that Redskin was disparaging to Native Americans PERIOD Now back in  the Washington football franchise using the name had their trademark protection revoked by a threejudge panel of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board who determined that Redskin violated the provision of the Lanham Act prohibiting the protection of trademarks that are disparaging scandalous contemptuous or disreputable. the ruling last week means that the football franchise will to have their exclusive rights to the name protected PERIOD

As I mentioned I find the word Redskin neutral PERIOD I dont associate it with any particular positive or negative values PERIOD I learned long ago however that the rest of the world and I dont always see eye to eye PERIOD For some folks out there when they hear that word they associate it with bigotry and the corresponding hurt angry and frustrated feelings PERIOD

At the root of all the debate about team names and mascots is a fundamental question Who should bear the burden of changing their behavior Should those who are sensitive to the use of a particular term realize that times change and a centuriesold epithet just hasnt got the punch it used to have or should those inclined to use said epithet and call it harmless put some effort into being more sensitive to the feelings of those around them

I dunno either PERIOD Im just glad Im a Duck PERIOD
