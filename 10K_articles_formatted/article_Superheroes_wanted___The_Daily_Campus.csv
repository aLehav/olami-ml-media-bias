6958,2017-10-10,"antigun activists gather at a press conference Friday Oct PERIOD   held by U.S PERIOD Senator Richard Blumenthal DConn. u.S PERIOD Senator Chris Murphy and U.S PERIOD Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro PERIOD Peter HvizdakAP

Nearly five years ago I watched evil take hold of an entire community PERIOD It ripped families apart released toxicity into the air and weighed heavily on peoples hearts PERIOD It still does to this day PERIOD It still weighs on mine PERIOD

Like many young adults in the country my very first job was a camp counselor position PERIOD For the most part it was a love hate relationship a job I loved and loved to hate all in one PERIOD Those experiences the sweet memories the old camp friends were innocent and light and perfectly American PERIOD

That is until my reality changed one December PERIOD Up until thenfor the past three summers I had transformed PERIOD Id put on my cape and hide all my insecurities and fears PERIOD For the duration of those summers I was perfect.I was a superhero PERIOD Sometimes I faked it but often I forgot that my smiles were an act PERIOD I forget how grumpy I was at breakfast or how little sleep I had gotten the night before PERIOD It all seemed so small and suddenly Id find myself laughing and smiling for real PERIOD

During my time at camp I met hundreds of young Cub Scouts kids who were rambunctious but sought adventure and knowledge PERIOD Some were introverted and required a bit more attention but me being the superhero I was at the time  I was never tired I never said no and there was always more for me to give PERIOD

I remember like it was yesterday meeting a young camper named Ben Wheeler PERIOD As the days went on Ben seemed more and more welcoming of our program PERIOD I thought maybe he too was starting to view me as a superhero like his friends did PERIOD

That December something so horrific and tragic happened that not even my league of superheroes could comprehend PERIOD Innocent children and their educators were taken away from their families in the most vile way imaginable just weeks away from Christmas PERIOD As the news of the massacre flooded the media the superheroes instantly got in touch with each other and prayed PERIOD In the real world the superheroes had little power PERIOD

The superheroes who never feared never cried never got angry and always knew the answer to everything were suddenly afraidsobbed cursed and were at a loss for words PERIOD Ben Wheeler and Chase Kowalski were two former campers of ours who had lost their lives at Sandy Hook PERIOD

The superheroes attended the funerals of both victims and mourned alongside their families PERIOD It gave them great comfort to hear from their parents how much fun they had at camp and how those little memories and pictures would stay with them forever PERIOD Ben was cremated in his Cub Scout uniform wearing the neckerchief slide he had made at camp with the aid of a fellow superhero much craftier than I PERIOD

These memories these people this tragedy is with me forever PERIOD So every time another mass shooting happens in our country each deadlier than the previous one it brings me back to that time years ago where the strong superhero I wanted to be felt powerless and ashamed PERIOD

We can pray for Las Vegas and Newtown and San Bernardino and all the mass shootings that happen all throughout our country that get little attention but it is not enough PERIOD Before we move on which we always do rather quickly we need superheroes PERIOD Im not talking about the first responders the doctors and nurses the police officers or the brave civilians who put their lives on the line to help strangers in need PERIOD

We need superheroes to strap on their capes in Washington immediately and know this uniquely American problem needs many superhero hands to go away once and for all PERIOD We need superheroes to stand up to the gun lobby to read the pulse of the country and to stand for what they know to be right PERIOD It is no longer incumbent on partisans and talking heads to make a lot of noise regarding gun control and deepen the party line divide PERIOD When its all said and done we like to yell at each other and then just run back to our corners PERIOD But we need superheroes to go beyond the debate PERIOD This is on all of us and we can all be superheroes PERIOD
