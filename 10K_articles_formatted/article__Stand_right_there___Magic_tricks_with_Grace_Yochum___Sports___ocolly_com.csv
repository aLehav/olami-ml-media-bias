OSU midfielder Grace Yochum looks on during the Oklahoma State vs PERIOD Texas soccer match on Friday October   at Neal Patterson Stadium in Stillwater PERIOD

With  minutes remaining in the match Grace Yochum looked at Olyvia Dowell and told her one thing PERIOD

The ball is going to come right here. both Oklahoma State womens soccer players were awaiting a corner kick from Kim Rodriguez and jockeying for position by the Texas Longhorns goal PERIOD When Dowell received the heads up from her teammate she positioned herself accordingly even though converting headers into goals was not her normal cup of tea PERIOD

Sure enough the ball sailed in the air right to the exact spot Yochum said it would PERIOD

I knew where the ball was going Yochum said PERIOD Because from the first corner kick Rodriguez hit an arch and overhit it I thought she was going near post so thats where I went PERIOD But after the first one I saw where she was going and so I kind of just planted myself. dowell knew that headers were one of Yochums strengths so instead of clogging up the box she simply decided to make room for the goalscoringmachine called Yochum PERIOD

All I did was back up Dowell said PERIOD Yochum was in a good position and she is  and the ball just landed on her head and obviously you got to put it in the back of the net and thats exactly what she did. yochums header that sneaked inside the far post put the Cowgirls up  and helped seal a victory PERIOD

According to coach Colin Carmichael Yochums ability to be physical and score corner kicks comes from a variety of factors PERIOD

Her height helps her convert corner kicks and she tracks the ball really well Carmichael said of Yochum PERIOD Grace was a great basketball player in high school and shes just a good athlete so shes able to track balls in the air really well. sam Hutchens and Ben Hutchens break down the OSU  victory over Texas PERIOD

Besides her tall frame and basketball background Yochum also has a mental makeup that gives her an advantage when competing for a corner kick PERIOD

Its a mindset Yochum said PERIOD If you are scared of it or if youre kind of like halving it and you dont really know what youre doing then youre not going to get it PERIOD Its all about attacking it and thinking that youre going to score every time PERIOD

Interestingly enough Yochums goal on Friday night was the first time the Cowgirls had scored off of a corner kick all season breaking an  drought PERIOD

The coaching staff had started to get on to the team because they scored many goals on corner kicks last year PERIOD

We havent really scored any corner kick goals this year so we really wanted to make a focus on it and we worked on it in practice Yochum said PERIOD

Although practice certainly played a part in breaking the drought it most likely wouldnt have happened without Yochum knowing exactly where the ball was going to end up before it was even kicked PERIOD

It was just really funny how it all worked out Dowell said but she scored and it was a goal so it was awesome. sports.edocolly.com
