Gwenn Miller is a junior majoring in journalism and a Collegian football writer PERIOD Her email address is gem144psu.edu PERIOD

My Opinion

Its not in any medical textbook but the disease is definitely lurking among the Penn State football team PERIOD

It is called high school superstar syndrome a condition in which people believe they will be as successful respected and glorified in college as they were in high school PERIOD

Remember your high school valedictorian They did it all PERIOD They were in every club from student council to knitting PERIOD They earned varsity letters in at least three sports and were managers for all the others PERIOD And they had a grade point average somewhere in the range of . pERIOD

Then they get to college PERIOD And they get their first B on a test PERIOD After that they write themselves off as a failure PERIOD

Well the same applies to football PERIOD The majority of the Nittany Lions came from successful high school programs of which they were the heart and soul PERIOD

When James Boyd was asked to name the worst team record wise that he ever played for his answer was simple PERIOD

 the defensive back said PERIOD

Boyd and the rest of the team is drifting in the doldrums of  and riding a twogame losing streak PERIOD Since their first loss against USC theyre ability to rebound has been nearly nonexistent PERIOD

Coincidence About as much as the events that led to Bob Knights firing at Indiana PERIOD

 offensive lineman Josh Mitchell said PERIOD 

It is not a case of big men running around with enormous egos PERIOD This team wants to win  badly PERIOD

The players remember their glory days in high school PERIOD They remember the success they had last year PERIOD But certain team members are realizing a few things PERIOD

 tailback Larry Johnson said PERIOD 

Granted thats hardly a consolation when youre on the road to playing during Joe Paternos third losing season of his career PERIOD Its still difficult to lose PERIOD And its difficult not being the greatest thing at your high school since pizza was added to the lunch menu PERIOD

Most of the Penn State football players were in this position PERIOD If they were mediocre Joe Paterno wouldnt have been knocking on their doors for recruiting PERIOD

Like Mitchell said the individual talent is there PERIOD It would be extremely unwise of an opposing coach to think hes facing a physically deficient team PERIOD

And it would be equally unwise of Penn State to think that they can turn things around by working as individuals PERIOD The losing can stop Saturday regardless of Purdues offensive firepower PERIOD

It can be stopped but only if the whole team coaches included gets on that proverbial same page PERIOD

 offensive lineman Imani Bell said PERIOD 

If the gifted individuals can come together as a team it is the only cure for high school superstar syndrome PERIOD
