Why Guns N Roses needs a new album

The students at Quinnipiac University were thrown one curveball after another both before the SPB spring concert and during Saturday night PERIOD

The Academy Is. who were scheduled to open the show canceled at the last minute disappointing a number of students PERIOD In an email sent from Daniel Brown director of the Student Center just one day prior to the show it stated that unfortunately the band is going through some personal challenges and will not be able to travel to QU. christina Tafuri a junior health science major said I was shocked when I heard they werent coming PERIOD They were the only band I really wanted to see perform and I didnt even go to the show because of it. rhode Island band Zox who have played major tours such as Warped Tour Bamboozle and Bonaroo were brought in last minute as a replacement PERIOD The band who have been getting a lot of play on MTV also received some praise from the Quinnipiac community despite reactions of the band being on stage for too long PERIOD

Sophomore psychology major Melissa Boulay said I liked them a lot especially their presence on stage PERIOD The guitarist and lead singer Eli Miller seemed to really be enjoying himself which is important PERIOD It increases the energy of the crowd. probably the most talked about event of the night was raphiphop artist TPain who kept the crowd waiting  minutes before finally arriving on stage PERIOD Once present he let it be known that we werent at a TPain concert but rather a party PERIOD Although entertaining he only played  or  seconds of a song talked in between and tried to recruit girls to go to a party with him PERIOD What was most shocking though was that people actually left during his performance that went overtime PERIOD

I liked it when he actually played music but songs were few and far between said freshman Mike Farrell PERIOD Hed play like a minute of a song and just when everyone was getting into it hed stop and start talking for ten minutes PERIOD It was ridiculous PERIOD He had like an hour and a half set and probably only played about  minutes of music if you can call it that PERIOD Hed play his collaborations but only the parts he sang on and then hed stop. but another shocker PERIOD TPain accompanied by numerous members of his entourage and security entered the crowd while Hamden police gathered around before pulling him off to the side PERIOD By this time at least  of the crowd left leaving plenty of room for Jacks Mannequin fans to scurry up to the barricade to get even the slightest glimpse of front man Andrew McMahon PERIOD

A born performer McMahon wowed the crowd with his incredible energy piano skills and general onstage presence PERIOD He treated the students to new Jacks Mannequin songs as well as a performance of Me and the Moon a song written during his Something Corporate days PERIOD And as a finale performed Tom Pettys McMahon is a fan American Girl which amazingly excited the crowd more than anything PERIOD

He never puts on a show thats bad said junior media production major Caitlin Downer PERIOD Ive seen him play a number of times and the fact that he played new songs here was awesome PERIOD I absolutely cant wait for the new album. the Student News Site of Quinnipiac University
