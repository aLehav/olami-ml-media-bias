Since the start of their inaugural Big East season in  the Georgetown field hockey team has gone  in the conference for a winning percentage of . pERIOD For a newcomer however there isnt exactly much shame in this abysmal record as Connecticut Louisville Syracuse and Villanova are traditionally top ten powers PERIOD Outside of the conference theHoyashave fared better but their  record with a win percentage of . is still nothing to write home about PERIOD

While all this losing cannot be any fun for sixth year head coach Tiffany Hubbard she has found some positive goals for the  squad to aim for PERIOD

We play a tough schedule against some teams ranked in the top  even top  in the country PERIOD These programs are established they have their traditions Hubbard said PERIOD Our team has the opportunity to be the first building blocks of a program and to accomplish firsts PERIOD It was just a few years ago that we won our first Big East game. the Blue and Gray have started the season with home losses to Davidson  and Rider  PERIOD The Rider game was  at halftime before Georgetown was able to prove themselves in a game for the first time all season and outnumber the opponent in the second half PERIOD

Twothirds of the roster is underclassman so the casual observer would be rational in thinking the teams confidence is shaking under the weight of the likelihood of another disappointing losing season PERIOD Hubbard sees things differently PERIOD

If anything the second half of our Rider game gave us a lot of confidence Hubbard said PERIOD We have a young team  for them to build up confidence is crucial PERIOD A lot of these freshmen are still creating their own identity. theHoyashave two weeks to get things straight before their Big East opener against Providence onSpetember20 PERIOD Friday night they play host to Towson who lost to Davidson  this past Sunday PERIOD Like all of their home games this contest will be held in College Park on the campus of the University of Maryland PERIOD

I think were used to College park so the travel doesnt really affect us PERIOD It isnt that far Hubbard said PERIOD Not many people have been over there to see what an amazing facility it is one of the top two or three in the country PERIOD Were lucky to play on it. after the Towson clash Georgetown will travel to Pennsylvania for a date with Lock Haven PERIOD If theHoyasare going to come out on top in either of these two games they are undoubtedly going to need to start scoring some goals PERIOD One in two games isnt going to cut it PERIOD The issue is that Annie Wilson who led the team in points last season and started every game of her career has graduated PERIOD In fact the teams top four scorers from a year ago received their diplomas last spring PERIOD

We have a lot of underclassmen that are stepping up to fill Annies shoes PERIOD She was distinct fast and feisty PERIOD Fortunately we have that in all our younger players Hubbard said PERIOD They really possess Annies grit and speed PERIOD We were lucky to have had her here but the people we have now can surpass her. hubbard called on freshman goalkeeper RosalieNolenbetween the pipes in the first two games of the season and she performed admirably especially against Rider when she had  saves.SophomoremidfielderEmily Weinberg and sophomore forward Sarah Butterfield who has theHoyaslone goal so far this season will have to step up and lead the offense if this team is to be successful PERIOD They are the top returning scorers from last years team PERIOD

Were taking this week by week game by game PERIOD We have nothing to lose Hubbard said PERIOD This is the most talented group thats been here since Ive been here PERIOD Every week we ask Have we improved Where do we need to improve

Georgetown field hockey could improve immensely this weekend with a pair of wins PERIOD It is critical that they avoid another pair of losses even the brightness of Hubbards confidence may not be able to fight off ominous approach of another losing season PERIOD
