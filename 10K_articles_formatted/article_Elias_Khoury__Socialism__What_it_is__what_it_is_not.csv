For a long time socialism has been considered a dirty word in the American political discourse PERIOD The poisoning of the label by corporate interests over the years has turned an ideological position with a rich and storied tradition into little more than an empty slur hurled at anyone even remotely to the left of the Republican Party PERIOD However in recent years there has been a marked shift regarding the reception of socialism by the American public especially among the nations youth PERIOD

Like it or not socialism as an ideology is gaining ground across the country PERIOD A ReasonRupe poll found that  percent of people aged  to  have a favorable view of socialism PERIOD Thanks in part to Sen PERIOD Bernie Sanders IVt. hammering the phrase democratic socialism into our heads and groups like the Democratic Socialists of America gaining significant momentum in leftwing grassroots organizing efforts public opinion about socialism has changed drastically PERIOD

Despite this the state of public knowledge about socialism is quite lacking PERIOD Many of socialisms biggest detractors and even some of its selfprofessed supporters lack any sort of knowledge about what socialism means PERIOD Such misunderstanding ranges from fearmongering talking heads on Fox News that insist life under socialism will mean that you have to share your toothbrush with your immigrant neighbors to wellmeaning liberal columnists who think that socialism both begins and ends with universal health care PERIOD The public discourse on the topic is dominated by those who either are themselves ignorant or fail to properly articulate the central thrust of the ideology PERIOD

What many think of as socialism is not socialism PERIOD Socialism is not simply the mere presence of a public sector PERIOD It is not defined as When the government does things. moreover socialism is not a blanket term you can attach to anything left of center PERIOD Socialism is not welfare nor is it a progressive system of taxation PERIOD

Rather socialism is a political and economic theory calling for workers control of the means of production PERIOD This means the abolition of private property and the creation of a system that allows for public control of the economy PERIOD Many often take the abolition of private property to mean that you cannot own things  nonsense

Chalk this up to a simple misunderstanding of terminology PERIOD In the socialist lexicon private property refersto privatelyowned facilities used to produce goods and services factories infrastructure etc. pERIOD Ones belongings computer car backpack etc. are referred to as personal property. anything added to that definition any qualification about how a socialist government organizes or how its economy is structured is not intrinsic to socialism and is not universal among all schools of socialism PERIOD There are many flavors of socialism and they at times endorse very different schools of socialist thought PERIOD Thusly socialism can present itself in various forms PERIOD This can understandably cause some confusion PERIOD

For example socialists often disagree about the role of state power PERIOD While some advocate for a centrallyplanned economy through a strong state apparatus others are explicitly antistatist favoring communal solutions rather than consolidated control PERIOD Another point of contention among socialists is the role of religion in regards to their ideology PERIOD While Christian socialists such as civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr. cite a religious basis for their economic beliefs other socialists adopt a more secular tone PERIOD With disputes as large as these it is no surprise that the socialist movement is rather fractured PERIOD

Clearly there is more to learn about socialism beyond a simple definition PERIOD Luckily there is a plethora of great resources out there to help you further your education PERIOD

Professor and economist Richard D PERIOD Wolff is one of the leading voices championing the cause of socialism in the United States PERIOD Despite being a prolific author on the subject Wolff has gained the most fame particularly among the younger demographic for his rants and lectures uploaded to YouTube PERIOD He also hosts a weekly podcast called Economic Update in which he analyzes current events from a leftwing perspective PERIOD

Another commonly cited starting point for those interested in learning more about socialism is an essay titled Why Socialism by Albert Einstein  yes that Albert Einstein PERIOD While politics and economics are not his areas of expertise he offers valuable insights as to what he believes to be the virtues of a publiclyadministered economic system PERIOD Einstein also offers up points of critique for the capitalist structure under which he was living PERIOD

For a lighter indulgence Chapo Trap House is a biweekly podcast that combines a socialist worldview with raucous subversive comedy PERIOD Hosts Matt Christman Will Menaker Amber ALee Frost Virgil Texas and Felix Biederman brilliantly balance nuanced analyses of world news with witty humor in what amounts to a skilled tightrope walk of educational entertainment PERIOD In listening one can expect to gain a firmer grasp on not just socialism and politics generally but the vast array of internet subcultures as well PERIOD This one is perfect for a younger audience PERIOD

If you start to become passionate about the cause organize Joining a socialist group or organization can be a great way to meet like minded individuals and get more involved in your community PERIOD Getting in touch with your local Democratic Socialists of America chapter would be a good place to start PERIOD In fact theres a chapter right here on campus at the University of Michigan PERIOD

You now better understand what socialism is and where to begin your further exploration of the topic PERIOD So what are you waiting for Get to learning
