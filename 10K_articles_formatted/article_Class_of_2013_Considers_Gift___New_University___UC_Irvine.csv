The Class of  Senior Gift Campaign is currently underway with a goal of raising  to renovate the Student Center Terrace Stage PERIOD

The project would create a new awning for the stage complete with lights sound equipment and tools necessary to improve this space for music dance and several other kinds of performances PERIOD

This project was determined by a vote from the Class of  PERIOD Current seniors were notified through email and from their EEE accounts that they could choose from three different projects PERIOD Students had the choice of funding a new maquee sign for the Anteater Recreation Center ARC new additions to the Newkirk Alumni Center to make it even more technologically advanced or renovations for the Student Center Terrace Stage PERIOD After a  percent voter turnout from the senior class the stage renovations was determined as the Senior Class Gift PERIOD

Before these three options were put to a vote by the graduating class a committee of seniors met to review all of the project proposals and narrowed down the options from which to choose PERIOD The committee members decided on the gift based on the criteria of the project being tangible and something that alumni could come back and see helping to increase school pride andor build traditions and be attainable so that the project was affordable for students to complete PERIOD

This years Senior Gift Planning Committee consisted of four student cochairs Nick Constantino Brenda Guzman Bill Miller and Jeremy LeOgier PERIOD

Constantino a thirdyear political science major graduating a year early decided to get involved with the planning committee after finding out about it at a Grad Expo table PERIOD

I hadnt really been involved during my time at UCI since Im a commuter Constantino said PERIOD I thought this was a good way to give back. in order to spread the word about the campaign the committee has been giving presentations to student clubs and organizations sending out Direct Mail communication utilizing the Telephone Outreach Program and tabling on Ring Road PERIOD A table was recently set up at the Senior Class Barbecue on Thursday April  to inform students of the project PERIOD

Of the visitors to the table there were some students interested in the project and who made donations throughout the day PERIOD

I think Ill give . ye Rin Joung a fourthyear neurobiology major said after visiting the table PERIOD I just want to give back to my school. some students on the other hand werent as easily convinced and inclined to donate PERIOD

Tuition is already so high and Im already in debt Jasmine Mistry a fourthyear biology major said when talking about her reservations about making a donation PERIOD Id rather donate to charity. addressing comments such as these and hoping to persuade students the brochure for the campaign says that a donation directly affects our ranking in U.S PERIOD News  World Report which in turn enhances the value of your degree and can influence your career. additionally campaign organizers see a benefit in contributing to gifts such as this one PERIOD

Each class leaves their mark on the University and displays their passion commitment and gratitude for the education they received Melissa Salazar Executive Director of Engagement  Annual Programs said PERIOD

Whats great about the Senior Class Gift is that its a visible demonstration to future students of the positive impact that philanthropy has on the campus. whether students agree with these points or not will be determined by the amount raised for the project PERIOD The total cost of the renovation is   it is hoped that the Senior Class can pay for at least  of this amount with the Student Center then covering the remaining costs PERIOD

The date of the completed project has yet to be determined  it is dependent on how much and by when the money is raised PERIOD
