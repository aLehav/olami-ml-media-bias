Jackie Rogowicz putts during the second round of the Nittany Lion Invitational on Saturday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD

The Nittany Lions currently sit seventy-fourth in the Golfweek rankings and will likely either need to move into the top60 to receive an atlarge bid into Regionals or win the Big Ten Tournament outright to claim the conferences automatic bid PERIOD

I know we are losing time and I dont want to hit the panic button St PERIOD Pierre said PERIOD The message Im telling my players is Stay the course do what youre doing and winning will happen. one of the players St PERIOD Pierres message was aimed at was Jackie Rogowicz PERIOD The sophomore finished second at the River Landing Classic but followed it up with a sixty-ninth place finish at the Briars Creek Invitational and a tie for seventy-sixth in North Carolina PERIOD
