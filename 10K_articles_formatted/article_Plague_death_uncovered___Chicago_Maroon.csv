2205,2022-03-16,"the death of University researcher Malcolm Casadaban caused a stir in September  when it emerged that he had been working with a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis the bacterial agent of the plague PERIOD

However a recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC painted a more complicated picture of the cause of death PERIOD

According to the February  report Casadaban was particularly susceptible to the plague because of his hemochromatosis PERIOD

When you deal with an attenuated organismthey are attenuated for most people but not for everybody said Dr PERIOD Ken Alexander Chief of Infectious Disease at the U of C pediatrics department and a member on the emergency panel called after Casadabans death PERIOD

Y PERIOD pestis requires the presence of iron in order to be virulent and the CDCapproved strain that Casadaban was researching lacked a series of ironbinding and metabolizing proteins PERIOD

Due to his hemochromatosis however Casadaban had unusually high levels of iron in his body which allowed the otherwise nonvirulent strain to become fatal PERIOD

These bacteria which normally are not very good at finding ironfound in him a rich and easy source of iron Alexander said PERIOD

Hemochromatosis is fairly rare with the condition affecting roughly one in  Americans according to the CDC PERIOD According to Alexander researchers had not considered the disease a risk factor until Casadabans death PERIOD

Still how the bacterium got into his blood remains a mystery PERIOD According to the report Casadaban did not attend all of the required safety procedure classes and did not consistently wear gloves while handing Y PERIOD pestis PERIOD

According to Alexander this constituted a breach of safety protocol but its unclear whether it contributed to his death PERIOD You can always prevent something in retrospect he said PERIOD

The University has made no changes to laboratory procedures in response to Casadabans death PERIOD The circumstances surrounding Casadabans death comprised a perfect storm and policies are not changed based on an aberration Alexander said PERIOD

Casadaban an assistant professor of genetics and cell biology at the University was unaware of his condition PERIOD

While hemochromatosis was suspected just days after Casadabans death the CDC report was published almost a year and a half later partly because multiple tests were required to confirm that the strain found in Casadabans blood was the attenuated strain PERIOD

Casadaban contracted the septicemic plague a variant of plague which afflicts the blood and is more deadly than the bubonic kind PERIOD

According to the CDC there are an average of  to  cases of plague reported each year in the United States mostly in the rural Southwest PERIOD If diagnosed and treated mortality for the disease is  percent PERIOD If untreated mortality ranges from  percent to  percent PERIOD
