Cal State Fullertons new Associated Students Inc PERIOD leaders said they want to go above and beyond this summer in their planning for the fall  semester PERIOD

The summer is very crucial said incoming President Harpreet Bath PERIOD This is where where you build relationships PERIOD This is where you get to know your resources on campus and this is where you really establish your entire plan and how you plan to go about it

Bath and Vice President Michael Badal are focusing to create one vision within ASI for the student body that focuses on four platforms advocacy communication transparency in leadership and student engagement and involvement PERIOD

We want to really make sure that this summer the entire ASI leadership and leadership on campus is working toward making it easier for students to communicate and understand all the things that are going on get involved engage as well as offer feedback so once that layer is crossed then we go into advocating on behalf of them Bath said PERIOD

The No PERIOD  thing we talked about is doing open office hours Bath said PERIOD

Badal and Bath plan to speak with assistant deans in each of the eight colleges to set up office hours where the pair will be available to speak with students PERIOD

Bath said providing an open forum can help further develop the communication skills between the student governing body and the rest of the student population which he said has been a problem for previous administrations PERIOD

I think students need to start thinking of ASI as a student government and not as a designated organization that just happens to have a lot of money and does a lot of events Bath said PERIOD I think thats whats been the divide in the past because students start thinking about ASI as a corporation. to combat the divide the duo is also hammering out the details for online feedback forms where students can convey their reaction to what the new ASI administration is providing PERIOD

The feedback forms are going to be very important Badal said PERIOD We cant advocate for students until we know what it is that they want to see. to facilitate student feedback an online feedback form will be created over the course of the summer to make it easy for all types of students to send comments to the administration PERIOD

Small feedback boxes were available in the Titan Student Union but they were more focused on building management concerns rather than student comments regarding ASI Badal said PERIOD

In other efforts to keep students engaged the duo has discussed several new forms of engagement related activities that will foster a more welcoming environment for both freshman and current students PERIOD

These include collaborative efforts with New Student Orientation programs and more onfoot campaigns like passing out breakfast or cards and flyers PERIOD

We dont need to reinvent the wheel Bath said PERIOD We already have clubs organizations Greek life all these opportunities available what we need to do is help market them. bath and Badal have spent time interviewing a variety of students to determine if they were an appropriate fit for their executive staff to help them further their vision for ASI PERIOD
