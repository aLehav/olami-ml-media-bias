There is no set formula for handling tragedies like  the recent terrorist attacks or other senseless acts of violence PERIOD Emotions and  tensions are running high because of the recent terrorist attacks and many Americans  are having trouble dealing with the sheer enormity of the situation PERIOD



As America rushes off to fight a war against an enemy that has no single country  it is time to take a step back and attempt to place things into perspective PERIOD



That was one of the purposes of a panel discussion title Responding to  Terrorism held in the Student Union Little Theater by The Friends of the  Forms last night PERIOD



The discussion was an opportunity for everyone in attendance to gain other options  to responding to terrorism and allowed them to ask questions concerning recent  events PERIOD The discussion featured informed educated and experienced panelists  who could offer the public the best weapon against terrorism another perspective PERIOD



While there is no set way for the public to handle a terrorist attack it is  always best to be wellinformed and have a better perspective than those who  commit such terrible attacks PERIOD Expressing our own views and gaining more knowledge  about the views of others may be the thing that many Americans need right now PERIOD



America will recover from the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  but it will take more than time and money to heal our wounds and our nations  wounds PERIOD The healing process will only be hindered by ignorance and blind hatred PERIOD
