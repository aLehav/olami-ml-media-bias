CCSU assistant professor of English Mary Collins delivered a twoinone discussionpresentation last Wednesday for a book she wrote American Idle A Journey Through Our Sedentary Culture and a book she edited New Models for News PERIOD

When Collins got into a bicycle accident after living a life that was very integrated with sports and physical activities it gave her a new perspective on what it was to be able to move around normally and have physical abilities that most people take for granted in their everyday lives PERIOD

I was at a real downpoint in my life after the accident and the writing transformed me said Collins PERIOD

The purpose of American Idle was to bring to light the problems that cause weight gain and lack of exercise on a social level PERIOD

Many people in America would be happy to go outside and exercise on a daily basis but many of them dont feel safe in their own communities PERIOD Collins wrote that  percent of health care costs come from lifestyle problems PERIOD

Collins took a look at innercity neighborhoods in Washington D.C PERIOD that were predominantly AfricanAmerican and Hispanic communities that had a problem of safety risks because of the high rates of crime PERIOD People who lived there were concerned about their own safety and that of their children PERIOD

I discovered it was a civil rights problem said Collins PERIOD It affected their civil rights and health rights. what Collins hopes the country will address is that there must be a way for average Americans to get right amounts of exercise to remain at a healthy state PERIOD She listed options such as installing showers at gyms so that people wouldnt have to go home after a workout sweaty or having employers give paid 15minutes breaks for exercise PERIOD

During her time as a creative nonfiction professor at John Hopkins University she would often be sent on trips to different states throughout the country and use these trips that were paid for by the university to explore various neighborhoods and businesses to see what the systems were and regularities of the peoples exercises were PERIOD

Whenever John Hopkins sent me somewhere I would make sure to make it into the setting for a chapter said Collins PERIOD

She looked back on many parks and fields that she played sports at in her hometown and how theyve changed for the worse PERIOD Almost all of the places that were lively and full of active kids are now empty and dont seem to ever be used PERIOD

We need to reclaim these places and its not just a health problem said Collins PERIOD

New Models for News is a book that Collins edited while she was an editorforhire trying to make enough money for herself to write American Idle PERIOD The book looks at new forms of journalism that could be used for companies or journalists looking for creative ways to release news PERIOD

American Idle is now available through www.amazon.com as well as the campus bookstore PERIOD
