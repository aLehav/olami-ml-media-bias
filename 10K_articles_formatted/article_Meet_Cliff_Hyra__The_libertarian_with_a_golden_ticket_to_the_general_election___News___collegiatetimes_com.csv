Cliff Hyra with his wife and children PERIOD

A sevenpart guide to the candidates running to be the next governor of Virginia PERIOD

Cliff Hyra may have been the last candidate to join the Virginia gubernatorial race but like all cool kids he has the potential of using this newfound attention to get people talking about what really matters  politics PERIOD

As you could imagine running for a statewide election as the third party nominee can set you at a disadvantage from the getgo PERIOD Fortunately for Hyra being an unopposed libertarian candidate means that he can take this time to find his edge and relax while his opponents vie for a space on the general election ballot this week PERIOD

Cliff Hyra is a patent attorney from Mechanicsville Virginia who is married with three young children PERIOD To him this race is a unique opportunity and he hopes to build on  candidate Robert Sarvis momentum PERIOD

He got about  votes which is about a  percent turnout PERIOD This is really within striking distance of  percent which is the threshold where if we hit  percent we would have automatic ballot access.I think you have to run the race with the goal of winning and being the governor Hyra said PERIOD 

If elected Hyra has addressed four key issues that he will work to resolve in his fouryear term  economic growth education reform justice reform and health care PERIOD

In essence his strategies to achieve optimal success can be generally attributed to one traditional libertarian solution deregulation PERIOD Most of his campaign hinges on the belief that fewer laws constricting peoples actions can do wonders for the economy incarceration rates and the booming of businesses PERIOD

More specifically Hyras economic proposal includes eliminating income tax of the first  and removing specific license requirements that cause businessmen and women to get tripped up on trivial tasks PERIOD

Currently Virginians are taxed . on  PERIOD This proposed cut would likely benefit the middle class the most but can still exhibit a positive change in tax returns for people of the state PERIOD

Involving improvements with the school system Hyra boasts smalltown research on charter schools in New York as a testament to the power of competition to bring forth greater student and parent satisfaction PERIOD He says that elected officials must put forth more effort to close the gap beginning with the states own research PERIOD

I was lucky enough to go to some really great schools in Northern Virginia but we also have some schools that are not doing as well in some places Hyra said PERIOD There are schools that have been really failing the students for many years and you know to some extent there is only so much good that you can do by just throwing more money at the problem. according to Hyra legal punishment for victimless crimes is counterproductive specifically involving marijuana and alcohol consumption PERIOD

Logically speaking Hyra says that lessening criminal punishments for these kinds of crimes will save Virginia money which spends on average approximately  a year to incarcerate a single person PERIOD In addition this plan could help reduce racial profiling PERIOD Hyra says studies show that African Americans are equally as likely to commit these kinds of crimes as others but are being sent to prison at much higher rates PERIOD

Finally Hyra has promised to change the face of healthcare by tossing out laws like Virginias Certificate of Need and is looking for a way to expand the healthcare plan without further involving the government PERIOD

Cliff Hyra is an incredible candidate Libertarian Party of Virginia Chair Bo Brown told Bearing Drift News PERIOD Hes brilliant PERIOD His wifes incredible PERIOD Theyve got this great family PERIOD Theyre a great representation of Virginians PERIOD Weve got to let a lot of our voters understand that there are other candidates out there PERIOD You dont have to stay stuck to one of those two old parties. because Hyra announced his campaign in late April and received the nomination in May little has been said about his qualifications for this role by other important political figures or by his opponents who are preoccupied with their respective primaries on Tuesday June  PERIOD

Hyra is a Virginia Tech alumnus who majored in aerospace engineering before attending law school at George Mason PERIOD

Hyra says that most people may not know that he became interested in the art of advantage gambling during his time at Virginia Tech and used his computational prowess at Las Vegas casinos for fun PERIOD
