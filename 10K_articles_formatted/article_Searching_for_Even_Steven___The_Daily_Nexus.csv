4148,2003-10-20,"something has been bothering me more and more PERIOD I have followed the debate in the Nexus opinion page with continuing dissatisfaction PERIOD

This feeling of unease climaxed Wednesday night when I attended a talk in I.V PERIOD Theater aimed at getting to the reality behind the myths of the conflict between Palestine and Israel PERIOD Dr PERIOD Adelman a professor in the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver came to provide the UCSB community with what American Students for Israel called a more balanced perception of the bloody acts that have claimed so many minds hearts and bodies in the Middle East PERIOD This talk sounded surprisingly similar if a bit more proIsraeli to what I read daily in the American media PERIOD

This was in fact exemplified by the Nexus coverage of the lecture Professor Gives Talk on Middle East Conflict Oct PERIOD  which did not discuss any opposing viewpoints except to mention that those who had them whatever they consisted of walked out of the lecture PERIOD The Nexus certainly did not praise Israel but did nothing to counter the information given by Adelman PERIOD As if they were the only victims Adelman focused only on the misfortunes of the Israelis implying that they are the single victims of tragedy in the Middle East PERIOD This is far from true PERIOD

I think we can all agree that Jewish people have suffered more than their share of cruel acts PERIOD I understand that PERIOD Like so many of the more fortunate European Jews many members of my own family were forced to leave their homes behind so as to escape the brutalities perpetrated by the Nazi regime PERIOD But the Holocaust  did not occur in a vacuum PERIOD Jews had been the victims of hatred and intense discrimination for centuries PERIOD It was no accident that many Jews felt they had no home in countries in which they held citizenship PERIOD  This is a very sad and very horrible condition PERIOD

That being said we also need to recognize crimes against Palestinians PERIOD Zionists looked to Palestine as a historical homeland  the last place perhaps where the Jewish people truly felt at home PERIOD Yet this region had not been empty since the Jewish Diaspora PERIOD It was not as many Eastern European Zionists liked to imagine a land without people for a people without a land. let me ask it like this would we as citizens of the United States of America hand over the country to the indigenous peoples of this land abandon our American laws and customs and then move to Mexico and Canada The Native Americans were and are abused discriminated against and forced from their lands PERIOD Most of this happened only a little more than  years ago not  years ago like the sources of the IsraelPalestine conflict PERIOD Dont we all feel strong ties to the land we inhabit regardless of whether we are of Native American  ancestry or if our families are firstgeneration Americans

I understand that this analogy is ambiguous and its supposed to be PERIOD Should the Israelis who were driven off their sacred lands or the Palestinians who were more recently forced away be the indigenous people in that analogy Many feel it would be just to give the Native Americans back the lands that were theirs PERIOD But is that realistic Dr PERIOD Adelman argued situations of colonization are completely arbitrary to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict because colonization by definition requires a home government to finance the conquest  PERIOD Cort
