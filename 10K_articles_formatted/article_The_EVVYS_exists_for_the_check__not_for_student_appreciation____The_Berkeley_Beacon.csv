By Jackson Bailey Staff Writer Living Arts April  

I was very excited to become a writer for the forty-second Evvy Awards Emersons student award ceremony PERIOD At the beginning of last semester I joined a team of other students in a fun and happy writers room with a diverse group of students from comedic arts majors VMAs and WLPs who have experience andor interest in sketch and performance based writing PERIOD We met a few times a month to write material ordered by our executive producer and our team would hammer out promotional material written award introductions and a larger narrative show PERIOD I spent my weekends and breaks chatting with writers and building a cohesive and fun showcase PERIOD

About a month ago I found out from my head writers that our team would not be getting seats for the EVVYS Gala event a show wed spent the past few months constructing PERIOD Weeks later I found out that our group would not be getting seats for the main event either the awards ceremony in the Cutler Majestic Theatre on May  PERIOD That is we werent getting seats unless each person dropped  dollars PERIOD

When asked about the decision to exclude the writers from comped seats EVVYS advisor Diana Barton stated the following in an email sent to a few executive producers and writers This year if we have room well give you seats PERIOD With that said this will probably be the last year that this is done. why Because in the professional world the writers producers and any other staffcrew on a show never sit in the audience to watch their show because they are working backstage or in the control room. she wrote that email as if were going to sell out began one disgruntled member of the EVVYS content department who chose to remain anonymous PERIOD Were not PERIOD Were not going to fill the theater for this event. the Cutler Majestic Theatre seats approximately  people PERIOD Despite this we still didnt get seats PERIOD

As writers we were frustrated PERIOD Wed donated our time and efforts to be rewarded with little more than condescension PERIOD I felt wed written for an event that removed us when it deemed it could make a quick buck PERIOD

Our next few writing meetings were a bit hostile but we werent the only folks unhappy with the EVVYS PERIOD A friend of mine was cut from performing at the Gala only a few days before the show PERIOD After months of preparation he had the rug pulled out from under him PERIOD Plenty of other unpaid production staffers dealt with tight deadlines and bureaucratic meetings PERIOD Everyone seemed to have a story involving the EVVYS Kafkaesque mismanagement PERIOD

Ive heard a joke from a few students whove worked on the EVVYS in the past that you work on it once to get the experience and then you never do it again said Katie Culloden  cohead writer of the EVVYS before chuckling at their own annoyance PERIOD

Theres also been quite a bit of controversy on the topic of fundraising PERIOD The EVVYS asks for student donations ticket payments and submission fees while also keeping an eye out for corporate donations PERIOD This year the award show took two tubs of ice cream from JP Licks beverages from Red Bull and  cookies from ChickFilA PERIOD

I found out about ChickFilA less than a week ago PERIOD In that meeting we mostly played it off as a bit PERIOD I can find humor in that in a dark way began Owen Asch  cohead writer for this years EVVYS PERIOD

But its horrible that we as a school that really touts itself as very LGBT friendly and really accepting of marginalized identities would take anything from a very homophobic company Asch continued PERIOD On a human level ChickFilA doesnt care about the students we have here PERIOD So that was a blow to the chest for me being like I am working on something funded by ChickFilA money PERIOD It feels really shitty. it is not public knowledge how involved ChickFilA is in this years EVVYS PERIOD We dont know if they wrote Emerson College a big check or merely supplied a few chocolate chip cookies for the Gala PERIOD What we do know is that any connection between a notably antiLGBTQ corporation and Emerson College is something that students wontand didnttake lightly PERIOD

You could just pin that on the Student Sales and Sponsorship Coordinator but obviously their work is advised Culloden said PERIOD I was talking to a writer and theyre considering not having their name on this project PERIOD Theyre gay and they just dont feel comfortable. the EVVYs is a departmental organization led by students and their advisor SEAL does not oversee this organization including the approval of an advisor Jennifer Nival the SEAL director of student engagement and leadership said in an emailed statement to the Beacon after the original publication of this article PERIOD

In our most recent writers meeting we cracked endless jokes at the expense of the college PERIOD Beneath these quips was a sad truth most of us submit to the EVVYS PERIOD Myself and a few members of our team submitted pieces to the EVVYS PERIOD A few of us were even nominated PERIOD Those who were nominated believed this was a cause for celebration PERIOD

But now the award is tarnished PERIOD As frustrations over the EVVYS continue to pile up I hear more and more nominees speak against the EVVYS PERIOD There were plenty of noticeable absences from the Gala with more than a few nominees choosing not to be present for the award show PERIOD I can only assume that the ChickfilA association and the ticket prices have led to students opting out PERIOD

While I want to believe that Emerson College is making an effort to push forward an agenda of inclusion in this years celebration of student work I cant shake the feeling that this award show is not some exploration of the professional world but rather an excuse for the college to do what it loves make a profit PERIOD

For the EVVYS that means turning a normal student celebration and awards show into a chance to shake down artists for a few more dollars PERIOD Ive come to the conclusion that this award show is nothing more than a well dressed collegiate play for money PERIOD

And whats worse is that it works PERIOD As someone who has submitted my own work to the EVVYS I understand the desire for an award for recognition from your peers. pERIOD This all works and has worked because we are naive PERIOD The EVVYS fundraising works because we are artists and it works because wed love to dress up for a show about us to live the dream of an award show nominee PERIOD The EVVYS will keep functioning as the largest student award show in the nation for this reason PERIOD Hell my acknowledgementseekingself may submit this very article for an EVVY next year five dollar payment and all PERIOD

I hope you enjoyed this years show PERIOD

Correction An earlier version of this article incorrectly assumed ChickFilA was a sponsor of the EVVYs PERIOD The corporation did not sponsor the show but instead made a onetime catering donation PERIOD An earlier version of this article also incorrectly stated that the EVVYs sponsorships and donations were approved by SEAL PERIOD While the EVVYs are an Emersonaffiliated organization SEAL does not oversee this organization in any capacity PERIOD

Jackson is a Writing Literature and Publishing major who has previously worked with The Beacon as a correspondent PERIOD When he isnt writing about local concerts and art exhibits Jackson spends his time watching NBA games snowboarding and traveling PERIOD Jackson hopes to bring some more excitement to the Emerson arts community this semester PERIOD

OUTRAGEOUS As an LGBTQ individual who applied to Emerson back when I was collegebound Im APPALLED that the college accepted a donation to the EVVYs from ChickfilA PERIOD ABSOLUTELY APPALLED How could they in good conscience do that

Theres a HUUUUUUUUGE disconnect between students staff  administration going on with THAT level of unawareness PERIOD This is staffadministration ACTIVELY accepting a homophobic corporation donating to a HEAVILY LGBTQ urban college thats basically The NYU of Boston that they work for and represent PERIOD I think heads need to roll on this and the Homo Hater staff persons need to lose their job PERIOD

And bch PUHLEASE writers ALWAYS sit in the audience for a gala awards ceremony PERIOD Thats like not allowing a nominated screenwriter to have a seat at the Academy AwardsI mean REALLY And then beg for  from them too  Cruel too that they pulled the rug out last minute from under the person who was going to perform PERIOD Thats showbiz I guess PERIOD","The EVVYS exists for the check, not for student appreciation. - The Berkeley Beacon",Emerson College
