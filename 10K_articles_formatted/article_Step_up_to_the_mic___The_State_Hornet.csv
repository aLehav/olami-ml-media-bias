Ben Brenner looks forward to Monday nights PERIOD Thats when the 27yearold attorney leaves work and makes a beeline for the Blue Lamp nightclub in midtown Sacramento PERIOD

I work hard PERIOD This is my night to get out and play said Brenner PERIOD

But Brenner isnt going to party or watch pro football with his buddies PERIOD He is in charge of the open mic that takes over the Blue Lamp every Monday one of several such events held throughout Sacramento each week PERIOD The open mics attract everyone from novice performers to grizzled veterans comedians and devoted listeners looking for the next big thing PERIOD

The whole point of the open mic explained Brenner is to provide a space for people to play where they dont have to feel like theyre being judged as theyre playing. open mic nights are rites of passage for many musicians poets and other artists who seek a short burst of exposure in a public setting PERIOD Most performers are allowed  to  minutes onstage where they practice their live acts and work to establish a rapportand hopefully a namewith a real audience PERIOD

The crowd participates with every song said singersongwriter Abrescy who fills her open mic slot with sultry acoustic soul numbers PERIOD It seems like everybody is really outgoing and has a happy feeling. the same can be said of the Tuesday night crowd at midtowns True Love Coffeehouse many of whom arrive early to get a good seat for the most popular open mic in town PERIOD Kevin Secondsa partowner of the True Love and former 7Seconds front manattributes much of True Loves success to a faithful allages fan base PERIOD

There are a lot of really young talented people in town said Seconds PERIOD They like to know that theres a place every week where they can come and try new material and try different things PERIOD They might not be quite ready to do regular shows yet or they might not have a draw PERIOD Its a nice place to get started. while the True Love draws an eclectic crowd and a certain novelty that comes with being the new kid on the block open mics at Old Ironsides and the Fox  Goose make the most of their venerable locations PERIOD

Local rocker Grub Dog replaced Seconds as host of the open mic on Wednesdays at Old Ironsides PERIOD He cites Old I and True Love as the bestrun open mics in the area adding that the crowd at his venue lends a loose atmosphere to the proceedings PERIOD

Its pretty rowdy at Old I said Grub Dog PERIOD We not only have the open mic people but we get the regulars at the bar too PERIOD Beer is generally flowing pretty heavy. located just down the street from Old Ironsides the Fox  Gooses open mic night has been a tradition for over  years PERIOD Bill Harper likes to refer to it as the granddaddy of open mics in Sacramento and he has been its caretaker since  PERIOD

When I was first playing at open mic I was lucky if someone threw a beer bottle at me joked Harper PERIOD Audience reaction has warmed considerably since that time and Harper says that open mic participation at the Fox  Goose ranges from  to  performers a night PERIOD

You have everything from hacks to really good musicians says Harper so you just get up and play music on your own terms and do it for yourself PERIOD Thats what people do at open mic and its really good PERIOD I wouldnt trade it for anything. open mics in Midtown have been known to attract standingroomonly crowds but 25yearold Steven Miller has been working overtime to get folks out to Fair Oaks where his open mic may be one of local musics best kept secrets PERIOD

Miller has run the Sunday open mic at Java Cafe on Fair Oaks Blvd PERIOD since early  PERIOD He admits that attendance has been spotty but he can count on a loyal group of attendees who come out every Sunday PERIOD Theyre always here said Miller PERIOD If I didnt have regulars then I wouldnt have anybody. aaron Smith is one such regular PERIOD The singersongwriter has been coming to Java Cafe for the last year PERIOD He says one of the best things about the venue is its patio where musicians are able to get together and play while they await their turn at the mic PERIOD

They have really really good musicians here said Smith who relocated to the area after a time in the Army PERIOD I had been in Japan but I just came over and I was blown away by Sacramentos talent. this is a cool place smiled Miller gesturing toward his makeshift stage at the front of the cafe PERIOD Weve got beer here weve got coffee weve got a nice huge patio PERIOD Its just that out here not a lot of people know about it. miller and Smith also frequent other open mics in the area both performing and spreading word of mouth about Sunday nights in Fair Oaks PERIOD Summer months tend to be the busiest time for Miller and Java Cafe when throngs of folks with a little extra time on their hands come out to catch what Miller calls the greatest free entertainment there is. the majority of open mics in Sacramento are geared toward solo acts or duets most of whom play their songs acoustically PERIOD At Old Ironsides however Grub Dog not only allows bandshe emphatically welcomes them PERIOD

I really encourage new bands to come out said Grub Dog PERIOD At Old I we have a great P.A PERIOD and plenty of sonic space for louder acts PERIOD Its a great opportunity for new bands to try out their material on an audience who hasnt paid five or ten dollars to get in the door. performers generally cherish such an opportunity to share their work with an audience they might have difficulty reaching otherwise PERIOD Fans have many more reasons to appreciate open mics including the occasional unknowns who show up out of nowhere to dazzle everyone in the room PERIOD

Harper still has vivid recollections of budding bluesfolk star Jackie Green making his debut at the Fox  Goose PERIOD

Jackie showed up here one night says Harper PERIOD By the second lyric Im wondering Who the hell is this kid He plays harmonica and acoustic guitar as well as anybody Ive ever seen PERIOD He had great original stuff. other artists and groups who build a following at open mics often earn the chance to play longer sets on a weekend bill with two or three other bands PERIOD Grub Dog mentions recent discoveries such as Life Is Bonkers Local Honey Willy Norton and Razor Lily as acts that flourished from local open mics PERIOD

Local musicians and their fans know what a good thing they have in the open mics around Sacramento PERIOD Open mics are where rough edges and polished gems meet in intimate settings all for the sake of experience and a good time PERIOD

Its free its fun and you might just hear some great songs says Grub Dog PERIOD You might hear some really terrible songs too but heyits just good entertainment either way. your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
