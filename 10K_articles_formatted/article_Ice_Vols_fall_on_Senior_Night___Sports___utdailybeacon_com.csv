Senior Night didnt go according to plan for the Tennessee Ice Vols Hockey Club as the team lost the first game of a homeandhome series with the Kentucky Wildcats  at Knoxville Coliseum on Friday night PERIOD

Rob Goldsmith and Donny Williams were among the eight seniors who were honored on Friday night PERIOD Goldsmiths goal came in the opening period by connecting on a slapshot off teammate Dan Yoders pass immediately after a Kentucky tripping penalty to keep the game close with their SECHC rivals early on  PERIOD It was Goldsmiths fifth goal of the season and fourteenth in an Ice Vol jersey PERIOD

The Cool Cats offensive duo of Michael Getz and Dylan Rohar scored crucial goals toward the end of the second period to keep Kentucky ahead  and finished with two goals PERIOD One of Rohars goals came in the third period off a shot made from his back with  left in the game to give the Cool Cats a  lead PERIOD

UT head coach Steve Durrigan was more than impressed with the fight his Ice Vols put up against their Division II foe for their last home game of the season but wasnt surprised by the combined effort PERIOD

It was what I expected because those guys wanted this so bad they tried so hard Durrigan said PERIOD The seniors went out and they tried their best to win that game tonight PERIOD Robbie Goldsmith looked great tonight PERIOD He really wanted that game PERIOD Everybody tried to pitch in PERIOD Its just that unfortunately it was against a really good team. goldsmith didnt let the loss hang over his head PERIOD The UT forwards sight is focused on the Ice Vols rematch with Kentucky in Lexington Ky PERIOD

I was happy with the way I performed Goldsmith said PERIOD I thought I worked hard and I think it reflected PERIOD We just gotta go back to work and practice PERIOD Tomorrow night were gonna try and correct what we did and make it a closer game and getting a win up in Kentucky would be big PERIOD A lot of the errors we made tonight were mental errors compared to Kentucky so if we can correct those I think well be fine for regionals and the SECs. goldsmith and teammate Williams were among the eight seniors honored on Friday night PERIOD The UT forwards commented on their hockey careers with the Ice Vols PERIOD

Im happy to end my career here Goldsmith said PERIOD These have been the best five years of my life pretty much PERIOD These are all of my brothers PERIOD I met so many good people through here PERIOD I wouldnt trade it for anything in the world. williams said Were like a fraternity PERIOD When I leave UT Im gonna leave  to  guys that I played with that I considered my brothers PERIOD Weve battled through tough times and great times PERIOD Weve had great wins PERIOD This years been a little bit tougher than the past three but its still fun in its own way and still battling with your best friends. williams snuck a goal past the Kentucky goaltender in the midst of the traffic in front of the net with  seconds left for his sixth goal of the season and seventeenth career as an Ice Vol to cap off his career PERIOD
