Some adults are hired as recruiters by the military to go to high schools hang out with children eat lunch and play sports with them and establish friendships PERIOD This is because the relationships they foster make it easier for them to convince the kids to enter armed combat PERIOD

It is very dangerous to join any branch of the military PERIOD Certain risks like the chance of dying in combat are obvious while others like widespread homophobia and sexual harassment among fellow recruits and officers are not PERIOD

Recently atweet from the U.S PERIOD Army went viral after receiving an influx of respondents explaining the devastating impact military service has had on their physical and mental health and that of their families PERIOD

By law military recruiters are givenaccess to any high school campuses that allow other organizations to recruit oncampus as well as contact information of all students aged  or older PERIOD A school attempting to bar military recruiters from reaching students on school grounds would violate the law and risk loss of funding PERIOD

The Alestle recently published astaff editorial stating that Juul should be held accountable for the harm caused by their messages targeted at young audiences PERIOD If this is true for a tobacco company this should be true for the military as well PERIOD

While high school students are constantly reminded of the risks associated with tobacco many of them have never been told the ways joining the military may adversely affect their health PERIOD Exposure to accurate portrayals of the military is not guaranteed but exposure to military propaganda is inevitable PERIOD

Data from Pew Research Center suggests an overwhelming majority of Americanstrust the military PERIOD For a majority of these high school students as well as the parents by which most of them have had their environments controlled and views heavily shaped information released by the military comes from a trusted source PERIOD

However because the military wants people to continue volunteering it is not within recruiters interests to provide each student with comprehensive information about the military experience PERIOD They benefit more from focusing on the positives of a steady job that helps pay for college among other perks portraying the obvious drawbacks as sacrifices made in service of a greater good and ignoring the internal systemic problems PERIOD This motive is enough reason to question whether a recruiter is presenting information accurately PERIOD

The military spendshundreds of millions of dollars on advertising each year to curate their image PERIOD This gives them the resources to make their case seem very appealing whether or not it actually is PERIOD Adolescents are especially impressionable and prone to making uninformed decisions PERIOD

While students may not be able to compete with the Department of Defense in terms of visibility we can all help paint a more realistic and grounded portrayal of the military experience in the public consciousness inform the young people around us of how enlisting may affect them and propose alternative solutions to the issues they would attempt to solve by joining a branch of the military PERIOD

Those who join will be affected by that decision for better or worse for the rest of their lives it is not a decision we can allow anyone we care about to make lightly or without comprehension PERIOD

I think kids should also be warned that more young women are sexually harassed at schools everyday than in the military with little to no repercussions PERIOD Im not sure if youve done the research but more people have died in mass shootings in the US than military members have died in combat operations overseas PERIOD Your entire opinion piece is based on flawed data PERIOD Its actually safer to join the military than it is to be a high school student or a civilian PERIOD
