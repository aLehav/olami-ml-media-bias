In less than two months Shakina Russell will walk out the shiny new doors of Lewis Cass Technical High School for the last time as a high school student PERIOD About two and a half months after graduation day she will realize the dream shes held since eighth grade  experiencing firsthand how great it is to be a Michigan Wolverine PERIOD

Russell who wants to be an anesthesiologist is a senior at Cass Tech Detroits largest public magnet high school PERIOD The student body is 95percent black PERIOD The same percentage will go on to postsecondary education PERIOD

Over the past ten years Cass has sent more underrepresented minorities to the University than any other high school PERIOD

Since  more than  percent of all black freshmen at the University have been Cass Tech graduates PERIOD

Why do so many Cass Technicians become Wolverines The answer lies in a recruiting relationship that reaches back more than  years PERIOD

UM and MSU think this is their school said Doris Walls director of the high schools guidance and counseling department PERIOD

For years the University of Michigan consistently attracted more Cass Tech seniors than any other school University officials said PERIOD  Today though more seniors from Cass Tech attend MSU PERIOD

Its not just instate schools competing for these students PERIOD Cass Tech students strong academic performances draw recruiters from across the country including Ivy League representatives eager to attract the top minority applicants PERIOD

I got a lot of letters from a lot of people said Cass senior Jonathon Ray who will enroll at the University in the fall PERIOD

He added that he was recruited by Purdue Yale and several private schools but only applied to the University of Michigan because it was his childhood dream to be a Wolverine PERIOD

The school has received two of the U.S PERIOD Department of Educations Blue Ribbon awards a mark of excellence in secondary education PERIOD Cass students average  on the ACT  a full three points higher than the Detroit average  and many have several Advanced Placement credits under their belt by graduation day PERIOD

According to Tyrone Winfrey director of the Universitys Detroit Admissions Office the University wins so many Cass students because recruiters make it a point to be highly visible in the halls of the high school throughout the year PERIOD

In addition to holding presentations about the University aimed at Cass seniors the recruiters talk with younger students about the benefits of attending college and offer individual advising appointments PERIOD They also schedule trips to campus so students can see the University firsthand PERIOD

Part of our mission is to be accessible and visible in Detroit Winfrey said PERIOD

Most important Winfrey said is developing personal relationships with principals counselors teachers and parents in addition to students PERIOD

He said recruiters often go back three or more times to help establish these relationships which is especially critical for urban students who are first generation of their families to attend college PERIOD In the suburbs recruiters are not as visible within the schools  often doing one presentation and sending a followup email PERIOD

It takes a lot more legwork to recruit in Detroit than in the suburbs Winfrey said PERIOD

One of Winfreys assets is his own history PERIOD A Cass Tech alum he has a fierce allegiance to the school and is not seen as an outsider when he recruits PERIOD He said his goal is to help students get into a good college not just the University of Michigan PERIOD

You have the responsibility of taking a student from one chapter of their life to another he said PERIOD

For Russell the short 45minute drive home combined with relatively affordable instate tuition and the Universitys reputation convinced her that Ann Arbor was the right choice PERIOD

As a magnet school Cass is able to mandate higher academic standards than other high schools PERIOD Students must pass a districtwide test to be admitted to the school and maintain a . gradepoint average to stay PERIOD

However according to Principal George Cohen student selection isnt the only factor that allows Cass students to achieve PERIOD He stressed the importance of a safe environment parental and teacher involvement and a rigorous curriculum as well as the legacy of the schools graduates PERIOD

When theres a reputation of excellence and prominence the school is a step ahead Cohen said PERIOD

But Cass must provide these services at a much lower cost than many suburban schools PERIOD As a Detroit public school it receives much less public funding per student than schools in Detroit suburbs like Birmingham and Southfield PERIOD This forces high school administrators to sacrifice certain things like band uniforms PERIOD Cohen said most band members march in Tshirts and sweatpants PERIOD Sometimes lack of funding  affects academic resources limiting the use of technology in the classroom and forcing students to share textbooks PERIOD

Yet even without these resources Cohen said Cass still manages to challenge its students PERIOD It offers  AP and honors classes and requires two years of foreign language four years of English and three years of math science and social studies PERIOD

Russell testified to the rigor of the curriculum especially in her AP Calculus class PERIOD  When I get a C on a test I want to kiss the paper she said PERIOD
