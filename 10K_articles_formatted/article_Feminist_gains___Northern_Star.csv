April  

After reading Beth Behlands column about the freshman English experiment with genderneutral word choice Im both amazed and amused PERIOD

As a babyboomer committed to feminism that dirty word that many females try to distance themselves from according to Behland I sometimes wonder how my generation managed to produce young women so totally ignorant of womens history PERIOD

Equally puzzling is the hostility some display toward the continuing struggle for womens equality PERIOD

Behland writes that with any luck equal pay for equal work is on its way to begin a universal standard PERIOD But as most of us understand it takes a great deal more than luck to effect such a profound social change PERIOD

Years of protests demonstrations speeches petitions lobbying striking suing persuading and demanding have brought us a long way PERIOD

Its these tactics that seem to embarrass many young people PERIOD How tacky it is to carry a picket sign How pushy is it to insist on equal treatment How fanatic is it to press for nonsexist language

Its my hope that those who feel this way are still too young and naive to realize that its foolish to accept the benefits gained for them by feminists but to reject any overt attempt at further progress PERIOD

When an example of that attempted progress is simply an increased sensitivity to language choice its pretty hard to take seriously a charge of blatant censorship. if teaching students to be balanced fair and nonsexist in their writing is censorship then journalists have been practicing it for years PERIOD

I teach my high school journalists directly from the  edition of the United Press International Stylebook which says in part Women should receive the same treatment as men in all areas of coverage PERIOD Physical descriptions sexist references demeaning stereotypes and condescending phrases should not be used  treatment of the sexes should be evenhanded and free of assumptions and stereotypes. censorship Never PERIOD Fairness Definitely PERIOD
