6810,2023-07-26,"senior Agata Kubik a native of Czestochowa Poland didnt have aspirations to study in the United States until late in her high school career PERIOD

After making her first trip to the states during the summer after her junior year to be a camp counselor in the Poconos she decided she really liked America PERIOD But what went along with coming to school here wasnt easy PERIOD

I didnt know what I needed to do at all Kubik said PERIOD I was like What SATs What is that exactly And it was already September of my senior year so by that time most American students almost have their applications ready and I was only figuring out what the whole process is about. with her doanythingyousetyourmindto attitude Kubik whipped out the SATs three SAT IIs and the Test of English as a Foreign Language in a matter of three months PERIOD

The culture and communication major has a passion for international relations PERIOD She spent time living in Germany when she was younger and speaks five languages  Polish German English French and Russian PERIOD

With her broad range of interests Kubik said the Division of Interdisciplinary and International Studies has been a great fit PERIOD

This major being an interdisciplinary major was absolutely perfect because I got to develop knowledge in all of these other areas and combine it as well as methods of communication and different cultures and how they interact and so on she said PERIOD

Though being an international student has its limitations and difficulties Kubik never lets that affect her PERIOD She takes everything in stride and has yet to be hit by senioritis PERIOD

Since she cant work an offcampus job she works four different jobs on campus in order to support herself PERIOD And on top of that she has two internships and an 18credit course load in her last semester PERIOD But no matter what shes doing she wears the same bright widemouthed smile PERIOD

The laugh she emits from that smile is something most of her friends and even strangers recognize PERIOD Senior Kirsten Cornille Kubiks roommate and close friend described it as a dolphin laugh but with a closed vowel instead of an open vowel PERIOD

Jean CelesteAstorina admissions counselor and cochair of Class Hosting at Ithaca said when she first met Kubik she was struck by her dedication and outgoing personality PERIOD

When shes faced with a challenge it really brings out her best CelesteAstorina said PERIOD I was new to the program she was learning along with me and she seeks to learn she seeks responsibility PERIOD Shes a naturalborn problem solver. senior Liana GarciaOsborne Kubiks other roommate and best friend said when she first met Kubik freshman year she was the type of person who took on too much at once but she has since developed into someone who knows what she can and cant commit to PERIOD

Kubiks organizational skills something she said she really had to work on have helped her manage a stilloverwhelming schedule PERIOD

Organization is not my strong suit but I had to master it in order to be able to do everything I want to and still be able to afford rent she said PERIOD

But regardless of Kubiks many commitments GarciaOsborne said Kubik puts everything aside for a friend in need PERIOD

She kind of intuitively gets a sense of your emotional state maybe even when you dont know she said PERIOD Shell oftentimes be like Are you OK Did something happen

Along with her already demanding schedule Kubik has managed to start the small nonprofit Womens Vocational Organizing for an Indelible Change in Ethiopia PERIOD

A year and a half from now Kubik plans to move to Ethiopia to execute this program where she hopes to teach women in rural areas different vocational skills so they can earn a steady income become empowered and get nutritious food PERIOD

Kubik had a chance to attend a summit in Philadelphia recently where she was able to talk to women of the Ethiopian Diaspora PERIOD She said they helped give her great ideas that she hopes to use in her initiative PERIOD

I dont want to make the mistake that a lot of NGOs do that they go into a developing country and tell people what to do she said PERIOD I want to empower them so be able to hear their voices have their input and learn from them just as much as they might learn from me and my experience. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
