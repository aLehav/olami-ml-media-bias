7632,1970-01-01,"the University Crew Club fielded three boats at the Covered Bridge Regatta on Saturday at Dexter Lake in Lowell PERIOD All three finished in the top four of their events including a secondplace finish by the mens varsity four PERIOD

The start of Oregons varsity races was pushed back by race officials fearing bad weather but the threat of rain didnt dampen the quality of the rowing PERIOD

There were more teams than in years past Oregon coxswain Laura Breedlove said PERIOD We had some great competition. the competing teams came from across the Northwest PERIOD This years edition of the Regatta was large featuring  racing organizations entered in  events PERIOD Squads in the collegiate division included Evergreen College Seattle Pacific University and Willamette University PERIOD All raced the standard spring sprint course of  meters PERIOD

The mens novice four was the first to race for the Ducks and despite seeing a rower slip off his seat in the boat during the home stretch Oregons boat finished in third place PERIOD The womens varsity four  Jen Fuller Annie Blomberg Rebekah Andrews and Hillary Martin  directed by Breedlove finished their race in fourth place with a time of  minutes . seconds PERIOD

Oregons third entry in the competition was the mens varsity four PERIOD Walker Julliard served as coxswain while Kennett Peterson Adam Fagan Will Ganser and Quincy SorroughAtkinson powered the boat PERIOD Covering the course in . the Ducks finished in second place behind a team from Seattle Pacific PERIOD

Everybody had a good row Breedlove said PERIOD Its nice to have this race to see where we are. despite the encouraging results at the finish line Breedlove maintains that her club still has some areas to improve in PERIOD

Were not as powerful as some other teams she said PERIOD We practice every day but we need to work more on endurance and efficiency. membership in the Crew Club has declined going into the busy spring season despite starting the year with a larger roster PERIOD

Its kind of weird Breedlove said PERIOD We had a fair number of people returning from last year. the rowers that still remain will travel to Vancouver Wash. in two weeks for an event that Oregon helped found last year PERIOD As its name suggests the Northwest Club Championship is for club squads only and is designed to give smaller squads in the region a chance to compete against themselves PERIOD

The Ducks will still travel to the Pacific10 Conference Championships later in the season going up against intercollegiate competition PERIOD Oregon will also take in large regattas in California at the end of this month and into May PERIOD

We want to represent Oregon Breedlove said PERIOD
