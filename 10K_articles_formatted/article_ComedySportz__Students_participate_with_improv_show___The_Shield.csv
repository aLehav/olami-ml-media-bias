Red Elk said he liked the game where the audience picked five different activities PERIOD For example the ComedySportz team had to act out playing hacky sack with the Motly Crue and the hacky sack was Nicki Minajs head PERIOD Red team member Claire entered the game without knowledge of what the activity was and shehad to guess what her teammates were acting out PERIOD Her partner gave clues through actions and jibber talk no actual words allowed PERIOD
