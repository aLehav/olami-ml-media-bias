Smokers and nonsmokers agree on one major point tobacco is extremely unhealthy to use on a regular basis PERIOD This has been drilled in the countrys head through television and print advertisements for decades now so no one can argue that they do not know of the risk PERIOD After several tax hikes and regulations the tobacco industry is currently under fire from several commercial businesses PERIOD

According to an article by Forbes CVS Pharmacy officially stopped selling tobacco products in all of their stores on Wednesday Sept PERIOD  PERIOD CVS now renamed CVS Health to emphasize their commitment toward personal health will lose around  billion in sales for their decision PERIOD

The stores actions show its desire to improve the health of the nation by banning a major culprit of illness but unfortunately the only thing they are hurting is their own profits  and theyre helping their competitors PERIOD RiteAid and Walgreens continue to sell tobacco products at this time PERIOD

CVS hopes that other businesses may follow their example to end tobacco sales in all pharmacies across the United States PERIOD However smokers will find another place to purchase tobacco PERIOD One can find tobacco products at grocery stores convenience stores and other pharmacies not to mention small tobacco shops PERIOD

CVS may get applause from antismoking activists for their attempt to lead by example but it seems that their efforts may be futile PERIOD Nonsmokers will look at this movement as a step in the right direction but not selling tobacco products in CVS stores will not convince many smokers to quit if any at all PERIOD

Tobacco use is a personal choice PERIOD When smokers use cigarettes they know exactly what health risks are associated with them and almost all smokers follow the rules of nonsmoking facilities PERIOD

Several nonsmokers complain that cigarettes pollute the air around them and make them susceptible to secondhand smoke something CVS also hopes to decrease with their ban PERIOD Unfortunately air quality is worse than ever especially in urban areas PERIOD According to an article released in April by USA Today toxic ozone levels are much higher than they were in the past for . million people in the country PERIOD The number of cigarette smokers in the United States decreased over  percent since  PERIOD

There is no doubt that tobacco smoke contributes to some of these air quality issues but it is time to wake up and read the fine print You are more likely to get ill from car exhaust or factory waste than you are from someone smoking a cigarette on the street PERIOD

In other words the stores moves are futile no matter how well intentioned they may be PERIOD I respect CVS for standing up against something they do not believe in but in the end it seems like another bad business move PERIOD









If we just look at the bottom line youre still missing a major factor by not framing the tobacco revenue in context PERIOD  billion is chump change to CVS PERIOD Their revenue last year was . billion PERIOD Cigarettes and smoking accessories are . of their revenue PERIOD

More meaningful is profit margin PERIOD Cigarettes are relatively lowmargin items and as you state smoking continues to fall out of favor PERIOD By all accounts the cigarette portion of CVSs profit last year is even less than the paltry . share of total revenue PERIOD

Eliminating such a small contradictory part of their business to refocus on enhancing their core mission will prove to make good sense  both ethically and financially PERIOD The other pharmacy chains will soon fall in line once they realize that the small loss in profits isnt worth the stigma of selling cigarettes when your competitor doesnt PERIOD

Theyve already stated that they have strategies to offset the loss but I would bet that the tobacco decision alone might pay for itself without them lifting a finger PERIOD Not only is tobacco use on the decline social consciousness and a desire for corporate message integrity are on the rise PERIOD If they actually do roll out strong new offerings as well the effect could be not just a zero sum game but a step toward increased profitability PERIOD

I dont think you know what the word futile means PERIOD Any improvement to air quality is not futile PERIOD Futile suggests no improvement PERIOD

Cars and factories dont congregate in my path at building exit and they dont brink stink into my office PERIOD
