Davis City Council members unanimously voted on Feb PERIOD  to place an initiative on the June  ballot that will ask voters to decide if they think the citys water rates are fair and legal PERIOD

Water rates are scheduled to increase over the next five years to help pay for Davis  million share of the WoodlandDavis surface water project PERIOD The first of the rate increases became effective on May   and the most recent increase was Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Three options were presented to City Council at the Feb PERIOD  meeting by City Attorney Harriet Steiner PERIOD They could refer the initiative to staff for analysis of impacts on the city adopt the initiative without change which would repeal the rate increases or put the initiative on the June  ballot for voters to decide on PERIOD

Supporters of the surface water project urged City Council members to put the initiative on the ballot seeing that as the most effective option PERIOD

The most important thing is to move forward quickly PERIOD Delays will cost citizens millions of dollars said Jane Runquist water project supporter PERIOD

Robb Davis a candidate for City Council said putting this on the ballot would help clear up a lot of confusion surrounding the water rates issue PERIOD

You have to put this on the ballot some members of the community are trying to roll back what was a decision of the whole community Davis said PERIOD

Nancy Price a member of the group that wrote the initiative said putting it on the June ballot is the most most efficient option because it goes to the ratepayers immediately PERIOD

Price added that only those who pay water bills were allowed to vote on Measure  in March  renters did not get to vote PERIOD

Putting the initiative on the June ballot allows for a citywide vote and renters many of whom are students will have a voice in whether or not they approve the rates PERIOD Under the new rates renters are being billed directly for the water rates when before it was typically not a separate charge PERIOD

Students who live in Davis have a right to vote on the rates PERIOD The rate structure still needs to be examined for fairness and affordability Price said PERIOD If this passes the city has the opportunity to revisit the rate structure. paayal Zaveri
