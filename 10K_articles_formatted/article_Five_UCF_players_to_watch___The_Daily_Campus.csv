Storm Johnson

The junior running back brings a nice balance to the University of Central Florida offense with his versatility he has  allpurpose yards on the year with  total touchdowns PERIOD

Johnson averages over five yards per carry and with him being a solid threat out of the backfield allows the UCF offense to keep opposing defenses on its toes PERIOD

SMUs defensive front seven will have to play sound fundamentally and make tackles at the line of scrimmage to keep Johnson from breaking out against the SMU defense PERIOD

Wide receiver
Rannell Hall

The   pound Hall has been relatively quiet the last two games but has made his mark in the return game returning four kicks against the University of South Florida for  yards good for . yards per return PERIOD

The junior receiver averages close to  yards per catch and while he hasnt scored a touchdown since week four his versatility is something that SMU has to watch for PERIOD

Halls kickoff return ability can be where he is most dangerous since SMUs special teams have struggled for most of the year PERIOD

Linebacker
Terrance Plummer

Terrance Plummer is the leader on defense at linebacker for the Golden Knights with  tackles two sacks eight tackles for loss and two forced fumbles on
the season PERIOD

At   pounds Plummer does move well as a bigger linebacker with two interceptions and six pass breakups PERIOD

If Plummer can cover SMUs slot receivers well it could be a long day for SMU if the outside receivers dont produce like in the University of Houston loss PERIOD

Defensive back
Clayton Geathers

UCFs second leading tackler on the team with  tackles as well as a great player in coverage Geathers is someone that Neal Burcham or Garrett Gilbert will have to account for at all times PERIOD

The   pound defensive back is physically imposing and is good in run support as well but with nine pass breakups his coverage skills are above average for a big safety PERIOD

Geathers is extremely versatile and will need to be accounted for in the blocking schemes due to his . tackles for loss as well PERIOD

Quarterback
Blake Bortles

Even though Bortles is coming off an average performance by his standards he is one of the best and most efficient quarterbacks around and will be tough for SMU to stop PERIOD

Bortles has thrown for over  yards on the season and has a passer rating just above  on the year so the SMU secondary will have to be at its best PERIOD The UCF offense spreads the ball around well too so watch for Bortles to try to get in a rhythm early and set the tone early PERIOD

If SMU has a shot at the upset the defense will need to knock Bortles off his game early and force some turnovers PERIOD
