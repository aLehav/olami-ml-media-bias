This weeks New Music Monday features new music from Drake Justin Timberlake and The Chainsmokers PERIOD While new singles from Timberlake and The Chainsmokers introduce new sounds that break away from their normal styles of music Drake is back to give us the summary PERIOD

Scary Hours EP by Drake

Its been a while since Drake has released new music PERIOD Ok its only been less than year since he released More Life but because its so common to see Drakes name up and down the Billboard charts going this long without a single from him is a bit odd PERIOD

The only exception is last summers Signs but that song was only in promotion for a Louis Vuitton runway show PERIOD Scary Hours is evidence that listeners have to prove that Drake is done with his selfproclaimed break from music PERIOD The twosong EP sheds light on Drakes current lifestyle PERIOD

In Gods Plan Drake raps about being hated on by others  in and out of his inner circle PERIOD However he reminds listeners that his success is a part of Gods plan so he isnt close to approaching failure PERIOD The next song Diplomatic Immunity is about the many things that are granted to him because of his fame PERIOD He mentions having romantic relations with Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna PERIOD He also talks about not being taken seriously as a problack artist like some of his contemporaries are PERIOD Drake ends the song by saying that the only people he can trust is his OVO record label family PERIOD



Supplies by Justin Timberlake

This is the second single from Justin Timberlakes upcoming album Man of the Woods scheduled for release next month PERIOD Upon first listen the single can best be described as a mix of trap music and country which is a weird combination but it still relates to the assumed theme of Man of the Woods due to the lyrics PERIOD

From a The Walking Dead reference to singing about saving a girl from the city by taking her to the woods Timberlakes vision of embodying a nature lover with sex appeal is made clear throughout the song PERIOD



Sick Boy by The Chainsmokers

While its unclear if this single hints at a new album for the duo the song takes on a political message that we have not heard from them PERIOD Throughout the song they describe East and West coast cultures of America to be very toxic and cause harm  hence the song title PERIOD The band describes the wellknown narratives of fame as becoming a prison and how social media culture creates a selfabsorbed society PERIOD
