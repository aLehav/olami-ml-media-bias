Netflix and Marvel had a rousing critical and commercial success with Daredevil the first of their 13episode TV series that will culminate in a team event called The Defenders. this team is the streetlevel version of the Avengers operating in gritty Hells Kitchen PERIOD So whos on the team and which superhero is getting their own TV show next

History of the Defenders

The Defenders debuted in  originally headed by Doctor Strange and featuring the Hulk Namor and the Silver Surfer PERIOD These were the Blevel heroes  those that werent quite successful in their solo runs PERIOD The roster has changed over the years and Netflixs current roster has Daredevil Jessica Jones Luke Cage and Iron Fist PERIOD

The Defenders operate in Hells Kitchen but dont have an established base PERIOD Unlike the Avengers who have a strict acceptance policy anyone can be a Defender and they can leave the team at any time making for a fluid lineup PERIOD Also unlike the Avengers which currently have a nice partnership with SHIELD the Defenders dont answer to anyone and dont really get along PERIOD

Meet the Defenders

First up is Jessica Jones in A.K.A PERIOD Jessica Jones played by Krysten Ritter PERIOD Jessica attended the same high school as Peter Parker possible SpiderMan cameo but was exposed to radioactive material that left her mostlyinvulnerable super strong and the power to fly PERIOD

She became the superhero known as Jewel but a traumatizing encounter with the Purple Man David Tennant caused her to retire and start a detective business instead PERIOD She tends to attract clients of the heroic variety and gets suited up herself once in a while PERIOD Currently shes married to Luke Cage Mike Colter who will be featured in his own show coming in  PERIOD

Luke Cage was born on the rough streets of Harlem but unfortunately his attempts to escape that lifestyle only ended up in jail PERIOD While in prison he was selected for a cell regeneration experiment but in classic comicbook style the tests went wrong PERIOD Cage ended up with superpowers of strength endurance and unbreakable skin PERIOD Hes making a living hiring out his superservices and often teams up with the Fantastic Four Iron Man and Jessica Jones PERIOD One of his closest allies is Iron Fist  the superhero getting the show after his PERIOD See how this all ties together

The actor for Iron Fist hasnt been cast yet but some names being thrown out include stuntman Alain Moussi and Ryan Philippe PERIOD Daniel Rand traveled with his family to the mystical city of Kun Lun where he was raised by a martial artist and gained the Iron Fist ability PERIOD Basically Danny can concentrate his chi in his fist allowing him extra strength and focus PERIOD Combine that with his formidable martial arts skills and youve got a superhero PERIOD Some easter eggs in Daredevil have been linked to Iron Fist  namely a symbol on the opium packets is the symbol of one of Dannys greatest foes plus the mysterious Madame Gao might also be from Kun Lun PERIOD Well know more info as this series gets closer PERIOD

And those are your Netflix Defenders PERIOD For a more indepth comic history check out the article on the sidebar PERIOD Get to know them because rumor has it theyll show up in Avengers Infinity War Part  in  PERIOD
