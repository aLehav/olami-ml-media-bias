Cooney is going to produce dozens of Major Leaguers here real soon and Ill be rooting them on. the last time he remembers stepping on the field as an Owl C.J PERIOD Nitkowski was getting a face full of dirt as a run crossed the plate handing him his eighth loss of the season PERIOD At that time it was a new record for most losses at Florida Atlantic PERIOD

One school transfer a mastered curve ball  more collegiate wins and less than  years later Nitkowski has become the only Owl to make it to the Major Leagues PERIOD

Hell be the first person to admit that his struggles in his only season here back in  were more his fault than the teams PERIOD It wasnt for me PERIOD I wanted to come to Florida and play baseball for a competitive team and Coach Cooney inspired me to come to Florida Atlantic PERIOD I didnt think Id miss home that much the New York native says PERIOD

Nitkowski wasnt the only one that struggled for head coach Kevin Cooney in that year PERIOD The team finished at . with a  record while fellow pitchers Matt Kramer  and Tim Holley  finished with a combined  losses on the hill for Florida Atlantic PERIOD

Also the teams ERA was far from todays standards PERIOD Even Kramers team leading . doesnt crack the top  AllTime ERA Leaders List PERIOD

I remember we were young PERIOD We all wanted to win we just couldnt find the tools to put it together PERIOD I admired Cooney and his knowledge but Florida just wasnt working out for me Nitkowski says PERIOD I learned a lot from my year there but everything else was a bit hectic for me and I told my parents about it and I elected to transfer. fittingly Nitkowski became part of the Storm the St PERIOD Johns University Red Storm in New York PERIOD

I learned how to pitch at St PERIOD Johns PERIOD Coaches were great and it was nice to have my parents there Nitkowski says PERIOD Im sure Florida Atlantic couldve offered me the same or maybe a better opportunity learning to pitch but home was  hours away from Boca. nitkowski who also met his wife at St PERIOD Johns pitched through his senior year in  mastering what he calls a big league curve ball and guided St PERIOD Johns to their conference title PERIOD Following that season Nitkowski was drafted in the ninth round by the Cincinnati Reds in  and two years later made a relief appearance after being traded to the Detroit Tigers becoming the only current Florida Atlantic pitcher at any time to make it to the big leagues a fact that surprises Nitkowski PERIOD

Really Thats a shock PERIOD So does that mean everyone has forgotten about my record setting losses says Nitkowski PERIOD I dont doubt Ill be the last Florida Atlantic pitcher to make it to the majors PERIOD Coach Cooney and his staff are an elite group and I have no doubts about it. florida Atlantic has had  players drafted the highest being Tommy Murphy in  who was drafted in the fourth round by the St PERIOD Louis Cardinals PERIOD None of the others have made it to the majors yet although many like Zach Roper and Carmen Cali are putting up great numbers in the minors PERIOD

Being drafted is one thing and making it to the majors is completely different PERIOD  percent of all the players drafted this coming year will never make an official appearance in the majors PERIOD Which makes Nitkowskis ride so incredible and a reason why he is our lone Major League player to date PERIOD

Nitkowskis advice to them and players looking to be drafted this year Work work work in the minors PERIOD Prove people wrong over and over again and never be satisfied with anything. minors are tough on you Nitkowski says about the life in the minors PERIOD You could be gone one day PERIOD You are alone because everyone is competing with you on the team so nobody wants to be friendly. nitkowski admits there were times he thought about giving up and if it wasnt for his wifes support and his strong Christian beliefs he would have PERIOD

I just knew God had a plan for me and all I had to do was go out there and give it my all Nitkowski says PERIOD

Despite Nitkowskis remarkable accomplishment of making it to the majors hes struggled to keep his dream alive PERIOD He has been on four different teams including the Tigers twice and this past spring he was out of baseball for four months PERIOD

The majors are tough Nitkowski admits PERIOD When I got called up for the first time I had a plan and I thought as long as I did what I had to do Id be okay PERIOD I didnt realize at that time that I was throwing to batters that had seen my plan and mastered it dozen of times before me. nitkowski is currently pitching in the Texas Rangers organization as well as inspiring others with his beliefs PERIOD And even though he graduated from St PERIOD Johns he still keeps an eye on his old college team PERIOD

I saw they won the Regionals last year PERIOD Thats incredible for the school Nitkowski says PERIOD

Although the school and I didnt match theres no question five years from now I am going to be telling the guys that I played there for a year and be more proud than I am now Nitkowski said PERIOD Ill be proud to be one of many Owl pitchers who are big leaguers PERIOD Theres no doubt about it Cooney is going to produce dozens of them here real soon and Ill be rooting them on. for more information on C.J PERIOD Nitkowski go to www.cjbaseball.com
