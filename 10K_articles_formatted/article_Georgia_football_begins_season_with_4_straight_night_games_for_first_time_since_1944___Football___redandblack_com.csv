Saturday night has been all right so far for Georgia this year as they sit at  to open the season in night games PERIOD

When the Bulldogs kick off against Samford on Sept PERIOD  it will be the third night game in a row to open the season PERIOD In fact on Sept PERIOD  the Bulldogs will host Mississippi State at night in Athens the next week after to make it four straight night games to start the  season PERIOD

The last time Georgia started the year with four straight night games was back in  under coach Wally Butts according to the Georgia media guide PERIOD

Over the last three seasons Georgia has played in three games each year that started after  p.m PERIOD To open this year the Bulldogs will play in four straight games after  p.m. with the potential for even more as the season progresses PERIOD



I enjoy it I mean it makes the atmosphere a lot better left tackle Isaiah Wynn said PERIOD It gives us a chance for all our fans to be there at night for us PERIOD Its a great feeling PERIOD Its a better atmosphere I feel like during night games then it is sometimes during the noon games. as Wynn mentioned he and the rest of the senior class has seen its fair share of games that begin at noon PERIOD While Wynn may prefer the later start time he and the rest of his teammates arent letting that get in the way of their routine PERIOD

We do have more time but as far as like our routine we do the same stuff we do every week inside linebacker Reggie Carter said PERIOD The routine doesnt change we just have more time to do it. the uptick in night games isnt just a welcome sight for the players PERIOD For students and fans it means getting to go to Sanford Stadium on a cooler night and sleeping in a bit more come Saturday morning PERIOD

Its good because I think our fans like night games but to us its just another game Wynn said PERIOD Even if its played at    its just another game for us. at the end of the day the change of pace from more night games instead of noon games is something even Georgias star running back can appreciate it PERIOD

Yeah I mean I like it Nick Chubb said PERIOD After getting used to last years all noon games its fun going out there under the lights in Sanford. late in the third quarter of Georgias Sept PERIOD  road matchup against Notre Dame the Bulldogs were in desperate need of a score PERIOD The team was down  and hadnt put points on the board since Terry Godwins onehanded catch more than  minutes of game time earlier PERIOD
