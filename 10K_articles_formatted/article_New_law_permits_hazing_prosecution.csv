Members of the Greek community who have been confronted with
hazing allegations this week may face criminal charges that did not
exist until this past summer if hazing did indeed occur at the
seven houses under investigation at the University PERIOD On August 
 the state of Michigan put into effect a law that deems hazing
a crime punishing members of educational institutions who take
part in the hazing of other individuals PERIOD

Under the law educational institutions consist of
both public and private schools ranging from middle schools to
universities located in the state PERIOD

In the laws provisions hazing is defined as an
intentional or reckless act that knowingly endangers the life of an
individual and is done for the purpose of gaining or maintaining
membership in a group PERIOD The person committing the crime can be
acting alone or with a group PERIOD

While the latest allegations of hazing involve the Greek
community the law applies to all groups on campus PERIOD

Among the specific activities prosecuted as hazing under the law
are physical brutality  such as whipping beating and
branding  and forced activity that can harm the individual
such as sleep deprivation or exposure to the elements PERIOD

The consumption of harmful amounts of food liquids and
alcoholic beverages is also covered by the law as well as any
activity that causes an individual to commit a crime PERIOD

Most of the time in the past there was no crime for
hazing said Wayne County Prosecutor Brian Mackie PERIOD

The Universitys Greek community has taken a strong stance
on the new law PERIOD

We are very much in support of the law because hazing is
a very serious issue said Lauren Herskovic spokeswoman for
the Panhellenic Association PERIOD

She also expressed that the law can only help the Greek
community by making it safer and increasing the amount of people
who become members PERIOD Herskovic said in the past many potential
members have been dissuaded from joining because of the perceived
threat of hazing PERIOD

Herskovic emphasized the fact that hazing is not accepted in any
form in the Greek community at the University PERIOD

Along with defining what hazing is and who and what groups are
subject to punishment the law also details possible sentences that
those convicted face PERIOD If a person is injured the perpetrator faces
up to  days in jail and a  fine PERIOD If the victim is more
seriously injured the perpetrator will face imprisonment of up to
five years and a  fine PERIOD

If the hazing results in the death of the victim the
perpetrator faces imprisonment of up to  years and a 
fine PERIOD

While hazing victims cannot be charged under this new law they
can still be held accountable to state laws involving other crimes
 for example activities such as stealing that may have
occurred as a result of hazing PERIOD All students are also subject to
University policies PERIOD In fact the Department of Public Safety has
arrested students for criminal activity in the case of hazing
events said Donica Varner assistant general counsel to the
University PERIOD

Before August students would be subjected to the
Universitys Statement of Student Rights and Responsibility
only Varner said referring to the code of conduct for
student behavior at the University PERIOD

Varner said she hopes this new legislation will help students
realize that there are real criminal consequences involved in
forcing other students to endure hazing PERIOD She said she also hopes
they will think twice and decide not to engage in these behaviors
at all PERIOD

In response to the law the University has created a massive
educational campaign this year called See Through the Haze
Dont Haze the Blue. on Sept PERIOD  the University began
the campaign by placing advertisements around campus warning
students of the dangers of hazing said Dana Fair assistant to
Vice President for Student Affairs E PERIOD Royster Harper PERIOD The goal of
the campaign is to educate and inform the student
community and to dispel the myths about hazing PERIOD Hazing and
the potential for hazing is much broader than one might
think Fair said PERIOD

Many organizations on campus including the Department of
Athletics Office of Greek Life Michigan Student Assembly
Residence Hall Association and the Greek Life Councils provided
input and support to the campaign PERIOD The campaign will continue
through the  school year PERIOD

Although the law is still too new to produce any evidence
regarding its effectiveness the general consensus is that it will
only be an asset in preventing incidences that threaten the lives
and wellbeing of students PERIOD

The law is one more tool that will hopefully put an end
to violent crimes due to hazing Mackie said PERIOD
