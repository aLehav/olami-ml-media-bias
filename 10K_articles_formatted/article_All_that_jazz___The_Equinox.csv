This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the faculty composers recital tradition at the Redfern Arts Center PERIOD

In continuation of this tradition the Faculty Jazz Trio performed a concert of original compositions on January  in the Alumni Recital Hall PERIOD The trio consisted of KSC faculty members Steve Cady James Walker and George Robinson PERIOD

All nine pieces showcased in the recital were original compositions by Cady and Walker PERIOD

Due to varying writing styles between the two composers Cady said the combination of his work along with Walkers made for a wellput together program PERIOD

Jim and I have slightly different approaches to writing stylistically and sound wise PERIOD And I think that those two approaches complemented each other pretty well in the program Cady said PERIOD

Walker said the program by chance featured a wide range of styles under the jazz umbrella PERIOD We didnt really plan it this waybut we covered a pretty broad variety of one of the styles youre going to find in jazz which was a very happy accident for this program Walker said PERIOD

Each of the pieces showcased in the performance were examples of jazz standards PERIOD Cady said this format allows the pieces to be played easily by any jazz musician PERIOD

We make a piece of music that can and should be played by any interested jazz musician Cady said PERIOD

Cady premiered his piece titled Mr PERIOD E which had never been performed in its entirety before the January  recital PERIOD

Including with the trio that piece of music had never been played through from start to finish as it were until that night in that moment PERIOD So that was cool for me Cady said PERIOD

The title of Mr PERIOD E is a variation of the word mystery a nod to the piece being built around the key of E PERIOD Cady and Walker both noted that particular piece as being a standout for them while reflecting on the performance PERIOD

We really seemed I think to connect on that and interact well as a trio on that song especially Walker said PERIOD

Other titles from Cadys work featured in the program include Youre It Bon Dame and Color Between the Lines. the latter of which closed out the performance PERIOD

While introducing his ballad Dont Go Walker referenced a quote by Robert Frost in which Frost was asked to explain one of his poems PERIOD Paraphrased Frost said to read the poem again and let the words speak for themselves PERIOD Walker equated this to the experience of listening to music PERIOD

Music works or it doesnt Walker said during the performance PERIOD Music speaks or it doesnt. walker elaborated further We could talk about the kinds of chords that are involved the kinds of style of music thats involved the influences but after a certain point you want to just listen to the music PERIOD Each listener has to let it hit them its own way PERIOD Different people will respond to the same music even the same performance in different ways. while addressing audience members Cady said the trio met recently PERIOD However Cady noted that there was immediate good energy between the group PERIOD

After knowing Cady for over a decade Robinson described a certain comradery that contributed to the performance PERIOD

Hes the only bassist other than my twin brother Chris that I feel as if we can read each others minds when playing together Robinson said in an email interview PERIOD The behindthescenes information I get from him makes his music that much more interesting to me and I really enjoy playing it. it was also the trios first time performing together PERIOD I hope that Steve and George and I get the chance to play if not this exact material more material in the future Walker said PERIOD
