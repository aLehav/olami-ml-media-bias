Say what you will about The Scorpion King but you cant deny The Rocks charm PERIOD Hes just oozing with it from head to toe or from eyebrow to rock bottom PERIOD

For a better actor this movie would have been an embarrassment PERIOD And if the movie took itself seriously it would have been painful to watch PERIOD But its selfaware enough to know its bad and so eschews any attempt at being profound or genuine PERIOD

The whole thing is a wink a nudge and a raised eyebrow to the audience PERIOD The Rock delivers his first line  Boo  with a smile on his face staring right at the camera PERIOD

From that moment on Rock plays the omnicompetent good guy  its what hes best at and just what the audience expects him to do PERIOD And if you werent beaten over the head with it already in one scene he chooses to save a kid instead of killing the bad guy PERIOD

The Scorpion King never lets you forget that youre watching The Rock and not really the Scorpion King by way of absurd explanation they have him hit by venomtipped arrow PERIOD Thats why he can flash a wry smile at the camera thats why he doesnt need to be a great  or even good  actor thats why he can give the peoples eyebrow and thats why he couldve been anything  a lion king an ostrich king a dragon king  because the character was just a longhaired thinly veiled caricature of The Rock himself PERIOD

By far the most entertaining wink to the audience was when Kelly Hu stumbled upon The Rock suggestively polishing his large large sword PERIOD Throughout this brand of supermasculinity is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously PERIOD At one point he enters an enemy tent proclaiming Ive come for the womanand your head. lady killer and bad guy killer The Rock is one of those protagonists who can magically fight off  attackers with a few strategic kicks PERIOD

The movies liberally sprinkled with humorous selfreflexivity PERIOD And yes its awful but thats what makes it entertaining PERIOD
