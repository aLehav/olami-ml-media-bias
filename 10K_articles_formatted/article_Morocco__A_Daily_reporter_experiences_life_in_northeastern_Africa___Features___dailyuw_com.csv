Showers early then partly cloudy overnight PERIOD Low around 50F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD Chance of rain  PERIOD

Updated November     pm















There were a lot of reasons why I decided to go to Morocco PERIOD Not all of them made much sense PERIOD

As a college graduate about to embark into the  world I suddenly felt a desire to get to know more about this supposed real world by actually going out and seeing it PERIOD And if it postponed even for a short amount of time the ominous job search that was ahead of me well all the better PERIOD

I spent three weeks in a country of contrasts fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and experiencing as much of Moroccan culture as I could PERIOD Oddly enough this included both public baths and hangouts at McDonalds PERIOD I tried to learn what made the people around me tick and what exactly made Morocco Morocco  the hip clothing chains and restaurants or the winding bustling medinas that hadnt changed for centuries

Maybe I went because I thought I could relate to this country PERIOD Like me it was inspired by so many different cultures and like me it wondered exactly what its place in the world could be PERIOD

Casablanca

The cramped red Petit taxis swerve and halt narrowly missing people motorcycles and other cars as I clutch the door handles and hold on to my pendant of St PERIOD Christopher praying that I dont die so that my mother wont be right PERIOD Im not normally the praying type PERIOD

A far cry from the Casablanca of Bogart and Bergman this city is crowded and exhausting PERIOD Whenever I cross the street or step inside a car I feel uneasy PERIOD Inside this taxi I am hot and uncomfortable PERIOD

I wonder why there doesnt seem to be any rules of the road and Im frustrated at the lack of concern for basic safety PERIOD

And then I check myself PERIOD The police in Casablanca are everywhere  near the mosque in the streets PERIOD There seems to be a police station on every major block as my friend points out PERIOD The taxi driver says that the police are effective and efficient PERIOD

I wonder whether people could say that about the police back home PERIOD In  there are no murders no riots at least according to my driver PERIOD People feel safe PERIOD

Im not quite sure how I feel but I realize there is maybe more to the grimy city than what meets the eye PERIOD

Meknes

 a little girl asks me in French taking my hand and leading me further away from the apartment where Im staying PERIOD

When I respond with the English answer she quickly moves on to the next subject PERIOD 

Her name is FatimaZohla and we manage to have an uneven conversation in French which she is only starting to learn in school PERIOD Ive spoken French for  years PERIOD She finds my name and hair pretty and thinks well make good friends PERIOD

In exchange for the English words she tells me the Arabic equivalents and more PERIOD I learn the words for stars cats cars and body parts PERIOD

At one point she asks  and raises her arms up before twirling around PERIOD

For some reason Im touched PERIOD  means God is great a phrase repeated quite often in Arabic countries PERIOD I marvel at this little girls faith already cemented at such a young age PERIOD

I look up at the skies and reply 

Fez

Im confused PERIOD

I wait a little impatiently naked and nearly blind in this room full of other naked women PERIOD I cant ask questions because Im not sure who speaks French or English if anyone PERIOD

Im at a hammam a public bathhouse wondering why I was so eager to come here in the first place PERIOD

I sit on the tile floor alone with buckets of hot water surrounding me PERIOD Should I be washing myself Im not sure because there seem to be people doing that job for others PERIOD I wish I at least had my glasses which were whisked away from me but admit to myself that they would have been useless in this steamy room PERIOD The only thing I can really make out is that all of the tiles are blue PERIOD

A young girl comes up to me she is maybe  or  years old from what I can tell about her blurry body PERIOD She tells me that she speaks French and asks if I need anything PERIOD I simply ask her what the heck Im supposed to do PERIOD

She explains the process to me and I feel a little more encouraged PERIOD Then before I know it a busty Moroccan woman comes up to me and gestures for me to come closer PERIOD

The next  minutes are well invigorating PERIOD My guidebook warned me that this wouldnt be the relaxing spa treatment customary in Western cultures PERIOD Im scrubbed harder than Ive ever been scrubbed before and the experience is a little painful and a little embarrassing  at one point I have no idea that shes telling me to lie on my stomach and we spend a few moments wrestling and sliding around on the soapy floor before Im in the correct position PERIOD

Afterward though I feel better than I have my whole trip PERIOD Whats more as I towel myself dry I realize the beauty of the hammam PERIOD

Here women can be themselves completely PERIOD There is a general feeling of camaraderie with all of the chitchat as veils come off and women are naked body and soul PERIOD I had found it a little difficult meeting other girls in Morocco  I couldnt seem to find them anywhere PERIOD Now I understand why PERIOD

The world of women exists primarily in the private sphere and it felt comforting to be there PERIOD

Agadir

After a stint in the touristy Marrakesh I am relieved to be spending a few days with a Moroccan family in this beach city PERIOD I love the ocean and I need to relax as my trip winds down PERIOD

Right around this time I follow the news more closely as word of the financial crisis and the election becomes more and more persistent PERIOD

I watch the first presidential debate numerous times PERIOD Late at night live when it first comes on PERIOD Later I watch it again with the family Im staying with and over the next few days I watch several clips in French and other languages as it plays on nearly every major international news channel PERIOD

And I realize though its no surprise to me how strongly the entire world feels about the election PERIOD I recount the number of times Ive been asked who I support Obama or McCain but its not until Agadir that many offer their opinions to me PERIOD

One man at a cafe asks me whether or not Americans understand history PERIOD He asks if I understand the conflicts in the Middle East or if I understand that the Iraqi people have nothing because of America PERIOD His attitude is offputting and at odds with most of the friendly interactions Ive had with people PERIOD

I can only respond that Im not the president and I leave him sipping his cafe and smoking PERIOD

After three weeks I fall into the rhythm of Ramadan and I feel a little more at peace PERIOD Im not any more sure what my place in the world is much less Moroccos place but I feel like I understand myself and this country a little better PERIOD
