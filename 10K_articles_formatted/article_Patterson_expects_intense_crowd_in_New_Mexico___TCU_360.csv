There is a lot more preparation that goes in for us Patterson said PERIOD You have to prepare especially when you play in somebody elses house to not give up the easy touchdown. patterson said the Lobos defense is strong fast and will be hard to penetrate  especially when the Frogs turn to their rushing attack PERIOD

They are a fast defense and they are always good against the run Patterson said PERIOD Especially at home they feed off the intensity of the crowd and I read that this week they have already sold over  tickets. patterson said even though the Lobos crowd will be a big one the Frogs will be ready and willing to take them on in the intense environment PERIOD

Our kids will like the big crowd Patterson said PERIOD We like playing in that kind of environment PERIOD It makes for a great game. the Saturday game will be Pattersons first return to the University of New Mexico since he was the defensive coordinator and safeties coach there PERIOD

I have a lot of good friends there Patterson said PERIOD It will be my first time back there since  and there are several people there that have stayed in touch with me throughout the years. patterson said the Lobos are much like the Frogs in that they play much better at home and they are always going to put up a fight PERIOD
