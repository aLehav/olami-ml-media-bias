By  Andrew SingerNovember  

It would have been nice of the public announcer to warn the crowd before the second half of Northwesterns  win over the NIU mens basketball team

Ladies and gentlemen we interrupt this close basketball game to bring you the John Shurna show

Going 7for8 from threepoint range in the second half Shurna racked up  points in the latter half of Fridays game PERIOD Exploiting the Huskies  zone defense at will the Glenbard West graduate converted nearly every open look he got in the second half PERIOD

After Shurna dropped his sixth straight threepoint shot at  in the second half the score stood at  in favor of the Wildcats PERIOD While at the halftime break NIU and Northwestern were separated by just five points PERIOD

Shurna entered halftime with six points on  shooting PERIOD

Northwestern forward Drew Crawford had seen Shurnas Friday night unfold before and was not surprised with his teammates ability to get hot at the right time PERIOD

Ive seen so many times where Johnny Shurna wont have such a good first half but he doesnt let that get to him Crawford said PERIOD Hell battle back in the second and once he gets one then hes on fire. once Shurna started hitting his shots Northwestern head coach Bill Carmody knew the juniors teammates would be smart enough to find him on the floor PERIOD

Drews Crawford gone on some runs like that where he makes a lot of shots and Shurna has done the same Carmody said PERIOD I just like the fact that the guys were getting the ball to him PERIOD When youre on the court you know more than the coach often times so they were just throwing the ball to the right guy. shurna took full advantage of NIUs  zone PERIOD One of the fundamental flaws to any zone defense is its vulnerability to a threepoint shooting team as accurate as Northwestern PERIOD In addition to Shurnas seven threepointers the Wildcats netted an additional eight bombs from behind the arc PERIOD

Even when the Huskies were able to get a rare defender in front of Shurna the 6foot8 junior would simply use his imposing height to shoot over the NIU defender PERIOD

As a coach you call timeout and you talk about getting back in transition and not losing guys and they listened to that Patton said PERIOD But then he just started making shots over guys and thats why it was difficult to play my son Michael Patton because defensively guys can shoot over him. in the coming weeks NIU will continue on its tough nonconference schedule PERIOD Senior shooting guard Xavier Silas realizes the upcoming challenges facing his team PERIOD There is one positive however that Silas sees in going against the likes of Bradley Temple and Missouri on the road PERIOD

On those tougher road trips I dont think John Shurna will be there Silas said PERIOD
