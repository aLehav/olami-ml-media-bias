As a mother of a high school junior who will soon be graduating and going off to college I was disappointed to find that the big reason Sen PERIOD Ben Nelson was rejecting President Barack Obamas stimulus bill was because it included money for Pell grants PERIOD

While there may be a number of issues that senators may have with the stimulus bill for Nelson to reject it on that basis was disheartening PERIOD I realize education may not be a priority for some but our students have suffered with cutbacks for the last eight years and our competition from other countries has increased PERIOD In fact many institutions have had an increase in foreign students merely because they can afford a college degree where our own citizens cannot PERIOD As young voters I urge you to become aware of what your politicians are doing in your name PERIOD
