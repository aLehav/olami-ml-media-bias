Andrew Simons gently pulled down a large jar from high atop a metal storage shelf in the Ecology Buildings basement

These are really cool he said PERIOD

Floating inside the container are three pale prehistoriclooking paddlefish or Polyodon spathula according to the jars label PERIOD

The specimens are more than  years old PERIOD They are preserved along with more than a million other fishes reptiles and amphibians by the Bell Museum of Natural History on the Universitys St PERIOD Paul campus PERIOD

Its like a library said Simons head curator of the collection PERIOD

And just as libraries confront broken book spines and torn pages the Bells animal collection faces its own preservation issues PERIOD

The National Science Foundation has awarded the museum a threeyear  grant for needed improvements to its invaluable but deteriorating collection of fish reptile and amphibian specimens PERIOD

The reason they gave us this money is because this collection is in desperate need of help Simons said PERIOD

Scientists from across the state and a few from around the country use the Bell collection in a variety of research projects PERIOD

Theyre perfectly good research specimens Simons said still holding the jar of paddlefish in his hands PERIOD Theyre a little bleached but you could take these and examine the tissue for mercury PERIOD You might be able to extract DNA from it PERIOD You could examine the gut and find out what they were eating PERIOD There are all kinds of cool things you could do. researchers hope that with the help of the National Science Foundation funds the centuryold collection can be preserved for another  years PERIOD

Right now the specimens are preserved in a rubbing alcohol solution  an economical mix that also makes the animals brittle PERIOD Using the grant money museum staff will transfer the specimens to containers with an ethanol mix which is also less toxic PERIOD

Metal lids on some of the containers are rusting and will be replaced PERIOD Some labels are fading and falling apart PERIOD

This collection was orphaned and not taken care of very well for a long time Simons said PERIOD

Prior to Simons hiring five years ago the fish reptile and amphibian collection was maintained for several years only by volunteers PERIOD

The people who took care of it did what they could but there wasnt a lot of institutional support Simons said PERIOD When they hired me it was a sign from the institution that they were willing to support the collection PERIOD That started bringing funds back to the collection. simons said the collections annual supply budget is approximately  making the  significant PERIOD

Besides buying maintenance supplies the grant will also set up a searchable online database of all the collections specimens PERIOD

Its going to make our collection more visible Simons said PERIOD If were more visible well get better use PERIOD Its like a library PERIOD Books are worthless if nobody knows theyre there PERIOD Its the same way with natural history collections. the grant does not cover relocating the museums public display collection from its current East Bank campus home PERIOD Simons said the University still hopes to eventually move the entire collection to the St PERIOD Paul campus PERIOD
