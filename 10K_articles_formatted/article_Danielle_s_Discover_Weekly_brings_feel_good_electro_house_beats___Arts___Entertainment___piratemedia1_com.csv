Danielle Schmid is the Visual Arts Chief for The East Carolinian PERIOD Danielles Discover Weekly aims to provide a fresh playlist for readers to listen to throughout the week PERIOD

Why by Bazzi

Starting off at number five Bazzi serves up a sappy dramatic RB single Why. he shows off his cocky attitude with lyrics such as its like youre dying to drive but you cant find the keys and no reply to all your text girl I do you mad cold. this song is really just him questioning why his girl still loves him even though hes a complete asshole to her PERIOD Im usually not a fan of songs with such a message however Bazzi brings very well thoughtout lyrics that have a poetic flow PERIOD Also Im really just hoping Im wrong about my interpretation of the lyrics and its more of him realizing hes not the best person and how lucky he is to have her PERIOD

Turn My Heart to Stone by M

M an artist familiar to the pop Electronic Dance Music world mixes jazzy saxophone sounds and relatable lyrics with highpitch vocals PERIOD When the chorus of this electrojazz track hits M transforms her raspy voice to an array of high pitches which paints a vivid picture in my head of her cringing considering the chorus lyrics I dont really wanna talk about it. these words being sung in such a high pitch brings a relatable factor because admit it weve all been in those situations where were really trying to be nice by simply saying we dont want to talk about something and almost always our voices get higher PERIOD Also with lyrics such as the higher you fly the higher you fall Id advise not listening to this song on an airplane as I am right now because Im not afraid to fly but that just put one hell of a thought in the back of my head PERIOD

Body by Loud Luxury ft PERIOD brando

The number three song Body is the ultimate feel good song of the week PERIOD This song not only brings a tropical summer vibe but with lyrics such as Hell nah been waiting too long hell nah I want that crew love but it also sends a wave of confidence the listeners way PERIOD This song never fails to stop building up and explores a sense of repetition that almost adds a sense of humor giving it a feel good factor PERIOD Also Body is another song Id highly recommend not listening to on a plane due to compulsive urges to start dancing PERIOD

Square One by Grandtheft ft PERIOD MAX

Square One is a pop love song with haunting beats that compliment the lonesome romantic lyrics PERIOD Grand Theft a DJ signed to DIPLOs label Decent laid out the ultimate beat drop that brings emotional sensations to your body PERIOD Like seriously you could easily lose yourself to the passion of MAXs voice and this song in general PERIOD MAX an American pop singer whos opened for acts such as Wiz Khalifa and Fall Out Boy brings a dreamy Liam Paynelike voice which is just naturally easy to listen to PERIOD

Limelight by Just a Gent NGHTMRE remix

The number one and most enchanting song of this weeks Danielles Discover Weekly brings edgy romantic lyrics by Just a Gent and electro house beats by the North Carolina native NGHTMRE PERIOD Before getting into detail I want to shout out my best friend Riley for taking me to see my latest obsession and future boyfriend NGHTMRE PERIOD Seeing this song live was magical Just a Gent and NGHTMRE provide the perfect mixture of savory and sweet when it comes to the mesmerizing voice and eye opening beats PERIOD This song is The Notebook of EDM as it brings the perfect amount of romance and fantasy yet still lights the explosives which gives it the spontaneous factor PERIOD
