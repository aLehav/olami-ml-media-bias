Heading into the matchup against West Virginia in the opening round of the Big East Tournament mens soccer Head Coach Larry Sullivan stressed the importance of gaining an early lead PERIOD However the Wildcats found themselves in a  deficit  minutes into the first half as the Mountaineers opened the match with a fury of offensive attacks PERIOD Although the Wildcats mounted a valiant counterattack they were unable to overcome this deficit and ultimately fell to the nationallyranked and highpowered West Virginia team PERIOD

On a brisk night with temperatures hovering around the 30s the West Virginia offense warmed up its home crowd with a blistering offensive attack PERIOD Although Villanovas defense had been a staple all year the team was unable to stop West Virginias potent offense as the Mountaineers connected on the games first goal off a corner kick  minutes into the match PERIOD

We knew prior to the match that they were very big and athletic and extremely good with set pieces Sullivan said PERIOD After West Virginia connected on their first two goals we seemed to settle down a little bit and we were pretty much even the rest of the way. after scoring the games first goal the Mountaineers continued to apply extensive offensive pressure which resulted in their second goal off a blast from forward Dan Statford that sailed beyond the reach of Wildcat goalie Jason Friel PERIOD Villanovas Joe Taylor nearly cut the Mountaineer deficit in half during the thirty-fourth minute of the first half when he launched a low leftfooted blast Zach Johnson was barely able to corral PERIOD The Mountaineers outshot the Wildcats  in the first half and controlled a  advantage in shots on goal PERIOD

During the second half the Villanova coaching staff made an adjustment switching from a fourback set to a threeback set with an extra attack PERIOD

With one more guy up we a got a little more of an attack in the second half Sullivan said PERIOD Unfortunately we not were able to capitalize on our chances and when you dont score you cant win PERIOD

Toward the end of the match the Wildcats generated several scoring opportunities with the greatest chance of the match occurring during the eighty-first minute PERIOD Senior defender Matt Sleece gathered a nice cross from fellow senior Mike Del Guercio but his shot sailed just over the crossbar PERIOD

Although the Wildcats suffered a difficult defeat they were pleased with their performance and season in general PERIOD

This was really a tale of two seasons for us Sullivan said PERIOD A  record isnt bad for us given the multiple injuries we faced and two suspensions we had to endure PERIOD Losing Dan Demasters and Jake Heyer to injuries really killed us on the offensive front PERIOD During our last few games we didnt really have anybody from the offensive front score PERIOD When you play teams like Louisville Cincinnati and DePaul and you dont score its tough to win. as the Wildcats reflect on their  season and mentally and physically prepare for their  campaign they will see a team that was filled with great potential and made significant strides this season PERIOD However the Wildcats will have to face a significant adjustment as this year marked the final season for Sullivan whose  years of guidance and expertise will be missed PERIOD The  Wildcats who will return several starters and key players should be poised to make another run at the Big East Tournament PERIOD
