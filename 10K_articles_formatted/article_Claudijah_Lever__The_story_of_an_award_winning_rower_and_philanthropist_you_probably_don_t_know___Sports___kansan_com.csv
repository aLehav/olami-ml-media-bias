Senior rower Claudijah Lever who was awarded the  Marlene Mawson Award has made a bigger impact in her community than in the water PERIOD

As reporters when an athlete wins an award our job is quite simple

We interview the athlete and he or she says its an honor PERIOD We interview his or her teammates and they say its the work ethic and ability that sets him or her apart PERIOD We interview the coach who says the athlete stood out and deserved to be recognized PERIOD

And when we do all this we sometimes lose touch with who the athlete really is PERIOD We lose touch with the fact that its a person being honored PERIOD

This is the story of Claudijah Lever a senior whose impact on our community extends far beyond her impact on the water PERIOD

Yes Lever is a rower PERIOD Lever is a rower who won the  Marlene Mawson Award for her excellence as an athlete as a student and as a philanthropist PERIOD Her drive comes from her upbringing PERIOD

My dad is my motivator she said PERIOD

She talked about her parents and their attitude that if she wasnt rowing getting good grades and working outside of school she wasnt really doing anything PERIOD

I did it for my parents Lever said PERIOD

Lever helped lead her varsity eight boat to a thirdplace finish in last years Big  Championship PERIOD She took her second varsity eight boat to a secondplace finish at that same competition during her sophomore season PERIOD

She has been a threetime selection to the Fall Athletic Directors and Big  Commissioners Honor Roll and she was AllAcademic First Team last year PERIOD She works as a Big Sister and volunteers at Lawrence Memorial Hospital extending her help to anyone that needs it PERIOD

My little sister just looks up to me PERIOD She doesnt care that Im an athlete Lever said PERIOD I do it because I want toit gives me a warm feeling in my heart PERIOD Things that give you the most joy are free and my helpful hand is free. not only is her helpful hand free to the community its free to her teammates PERIOD Senior Brooke Thuston has been with Lever throughout her entire time at the University and her view of her teammate can be summed up in just three words PERIOD

She motivates me Thuston said PERIOD

Kenzie Obrochta is a sophomore this year PERIOD When she entered the program Lever was well entrenched as a leader and a star on the team PERIOD Obrochta has a rowing pedigree PERIOD She is from Buffalo where rowing is as natural to her as football is to the South PERIOD Despite rowing all her life she still continues to learn from Lever which can also be summed up in just one simple phrase PERIOD

We all want to be that same way Obrochta said PERIOD

Every program needs a signature athlete one who defines the early stages of the sport through her athletic performance and her influence on her teammates and coach PERIOD

Lever has helped the veterans improve and shes helped the rookies learn PERIOD

Unfortunately in a school where basketball is the light at the end of every days tunnel rowing goes unnoticed and so do the athletes PERIOD

Its tough Obrochta said PERIOD People just dont know what we do PERIOD They have no idea the work we put in they dont give us respect for what we do. but Lever is a special athlete who won a special award PERIOD She represents all the athletes who get looked over by people like me when were trying to find a story PERIOD

You wont find a much more compelling story than Claudijah Lever PERIOD This is a story of dedication passion and love not just to the sport but to her team and her community PERIOD

Attitude action devotion and hard work are all the things that as a coach I appreciate Coach Rob Catloth said PERIOD Do coaches have favorites Yeah the ones that work hard and try to make the team better PERIOD Theyre our favorites. catloth hopes for a long line of award winners as the team gets older and all lines have to start with one point PERIOD

I dont look at her any differently now Catloth said PERIOD

But history always will PERIOD

History will see her as an award winner PERIOD Catloth will look at her as a leader on his best boat PERIOD Kansas rowing will look at her as the start of the rich tradition its building PERIOD

But what Lever has done transcends opinion and history PERIOD

By being the first rower to win the Marlene Mawson Award shes made her permanent mark on KU rowing but she doesnt see it like that PERIOD For her its just one less space in the trophy cabinet PERIOD

Whether shes recognized or not shell continue to excel on the water in school and change her community as shes done throughout her career PERIOD

I may try to paint her as a star but her team will always see her as simply Claudijah Lever PERIOD
