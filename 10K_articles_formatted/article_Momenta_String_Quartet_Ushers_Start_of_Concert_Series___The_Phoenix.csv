Earlier this week the Momenta String Quartet ushered in another year of Swarthmores Midday Monday Concert Series PERIOD The four instrumentalists Miranda Cuckson and Annaliesa Place on violins Stephanie Griffin on viola and Joanne Lin  in cello exposed the audience to both classical and modernist music PERIOD

Based out of Temple University the Momenta String Quartet has earned itself a grand reputation in the classical music world since its debut concert in November  PERIOD In addition to having previously performed in places as diverse as Swarthmore and Jakarta the group had premiered the work of both established and upandcoming composers fifteen times PERIOD

The four women began the program with Louis Janaceks String Quartet No PERIOD . inspired by a Tolstoys Kreutzer Sonata a notsocheery novella on a man murdering his wife Janacek composed a piece filled with a sense of somberness and tension PERIOD The quartet would switch rapidly from playing dark legato notes to making short scratchy bowings PERIOD

Next Momenta performed Structures for String Quartet a modernist piece composed by Morton Feldman PERIOD A signature example of Feldmans abstract style Structures emphasized the playing of individual spaced notes PERIOD The violinists cellist and violist would pluck out notes creating for this reporter what sounded like musical rain falling over an ascending scale PERIOD Structures was atypical for Feldman in its brevity with a total running time of about five minutes a far cry from the fiveandahalf hours it takes to perform Feldmans String Quartet No PERIOD  PERIOD

The program concluded with Robert Schumanns String Quartet in F PERIOD major Op PERIOD  No PERIOD . a brilliant manicdepressive Schumann composed four movements that reveal the calm and turmoil of the inner mind PERIOD The Momenta String Quartet created a real sense of tension from the peaceful sections of the opening Allegro vivace to the more intense Scherzo Presto PERIOD Most impressively none of the instrumentalists lost focus as a water bottle rolled from the audience across the stage during the final movement PERIOD

The Momenta concert showcased the technical prowess of its members as well as the groups ability to create very emotional music PERIOD

Great review Nate  Nice to see the Gazettes classical music section continuing PERIOD
