If you want to be confused for a few minutes you can smoke salvia PERIOD Your vision might tremble your thoughts might jumble and you might be useless for a short time PERIOD

If you want to be confused for more than a few minutes you can research the laws surrounding the legality of this psychotropic plant PERIOD

In most of the United States  including Nebraska  salvia divinorum is legal PERIOD The plant is native to southern Mexico and has been used for centuries to cause hallucinations and to alter a persons state of mind PERIOD

Despite its legality Christian Firoz owner of Exotica on  N PERIOD forty-eighth St. was charged for selling the herb last March PERIOD

Katie Flood a communication officer for the Lincoln Police Department said an undercover officer entered Exotica on March  last year and purchased a half gram of salvia for  PERIOD After the purchase the LPD obtained a search warrant and found another   grams of salvia in the store PERIOD

Firoz was charged with violating state statute  PERIOD According to the statute it is illegal to sell any substance when the intended use of the substance is to intoxicate a person PERIOD The only exception to this statute is the sale of alcohol PERIOD

 Flood said PERIOD

She said the LPDs understanding of this statute is that  is illegal no matter what PERIOD

That wasnt the information Firoz received when he contacted law enforcement officials while researching the legality of selling the plant prior to being arrested however PERIOD

Before Exotica started selling salvia Firoz had a store manager Heather Sanchez send emails to Omaha Deputy Police Chief John Ewing  who is now the Douglas County treasurer  asking about selling the substance PERIOD

 Sanchez wrote in her email to the law enforcement officials PERIOD

The police emailed back and said that although they believed the plant to be dangerous selling it was not illegal PERIOD

Firozs fate will not be decided until Jan PERIOD  when he goes to trial for violating the statute but one of the first bills introduced by the new Nebraska Unicameral is one that will clear up some of the haze surrounding the plant PERIOD

Last Friday Sen PERIOD Russ Karpisek of Wilber introduced a bill LB123 that will put salvia in the same group as other psychedelic drugs like marijuana certain mushrooms and LSD PERIOD

 Karpisek said PERIOD 

Last year an identical bill was introduced which was going to be added to another bill Karpisek sponsored that would have criminalized marijuana in the state PERIOD Nebraska is one of several states where being caught with marijuana is a citation and not a misdemeanor PERIOD Karpiseks bill would have changed this but the Unicameral did not vote on it PERIOD

Karpisek was able to double the fines a person will receive when caught with marijuana and said he will not introduce another bill that would change Nebraskas policy surrounding the drug PERIOD

Karpisek said he is expecting some but not a lot of debate when LB123 hits the floor PERIOD

 Karpisek said PERIOD 

Ironically Karpisek and other senators who support LB123 wont take any flack from the only man who was ticketed for salvia PERIOD Firoz actually plans on testifying in support of making salvia illegal PERIOD

 Firoz said PERIOD
