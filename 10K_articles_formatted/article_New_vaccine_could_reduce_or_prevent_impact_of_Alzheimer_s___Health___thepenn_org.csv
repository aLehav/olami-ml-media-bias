Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm









The brain has about  billion cells called neurons PERIOD

By Stephen Beech via SWNS

A new vaccine could reduce or even prevent the devastating impact of Alzheimers disease according to new research PERIOD

The jab which targets a protein involved in the most common cause of dementia helped eliminate toxic cells in mice with the condition PERIOD

Scientists say the mice had fewer amyloid plaques and less inflammation in their brain tissue after the SAGP vaccination  and they also showed improvement in behavior and awareness PERIOD

Researchers hope the vaccine that targets inflamed brain cells associated with Alzheimers offers fresh hope in treating soaring dementia cases PERIOD

More than  people are estimated to have dementia in the UK while around . million Americans had Alzheimers disease in  according to the American Heart Association PERIOD That number is forecast to rise to . million by  PERIOD

The new vaccine has been developed by researchers at Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan PERIOD

Bu it has yet to be tested in humans PERIOD

Study lead author Dr PERIOD ChiehLun Hsiao said Alzheimers disease now accounts for  percent to  percent of dementia patients worldwide PERIOD

The future challenge will be to achieve similar results in humans PERIOD

If the vaccine could prove to be successful in humans it would be a big step forward towards delaying disease progression or even prevention of this disease. robina Weermeijer

The researchers created an Alzheimers disease mouse model that mimics a human brain and simulates amyloidbetainduced Alzheimers disease pathology PERIOD

Usually people in the late stage of Alzheimers lack anxiety which means they are not aware of the things around them PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Hsiao said the mice who received the vaccine had anxiety which means that they were more cautious and more aware of things around them  a sign the researchers say could indicate a lessening of the disease PERIOD Several inflammatory biomarkers of Alzheimers disease were also reduced PERIOD

A behavior test on the mice at six months old also revealed that those that received the SAGP vaccine responded  to their environment than those who received a placebo vaccine PERIOD

The SAGPvaccinated mice tended to behave like normal healthy mice and exhibited more awareness of their surroundings PERIOD

The SAGP protein was shown to be located very near to specialized brain cells called microglia which play a role in the immune defence of the central nervous system PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Hsiao explained that microglia help clear damaging plaque formed by proteins however they also trigger brain inflammation that can damage neurons and worsen cognitive decline in a person which could be one of the causes of Alzheimers disease development PERIOD

Steven HWG

In Alzheimers disease an accumulation of brain proteins called amyloid beta peptides clump together forming plaques that collect between neurons and disrupt cell function PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Hsiao said Earlier studies using different vaccines to treat Alzheimers disease in mouse models have been successful in reducing amyloid plaque deposits and inflammatory factors however what makes our study different is that our SAGP vaccine also altered the behaviour of these mice for the better.highly elevatedA vaccine could target activated microglia and remove these toxic cells ultimately repairing the deficits in behavior suffered in Alzheimers disease. the findings of the preliminary research were presented at the American Heart Associations Basic Cardiovascular Sciences Scientific Sessions in Boston Mass PERIOD
