The Dorothea Dix Park is  acres in size some of which is leased by the state for their administrative operations of the NC Department of Health and Human Services PERIOD



Raleigh has the unique opportunity to work with a worldfamous design firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates to turn Dorothea Dix park into a park like no other PERIOD After the city of Raleigh bought the property from North Carolina in  which was formerly home to a mental health institution the area was designated to be a park PERIOD

Currently the 308acre green space off Western Boulevard is not easily accessible to the public PERIOD By working with the design firm Raleighs goal is to turn the area into a stateoftheart park that connects to the rest of the city PERIOD

Kate Pearce the senior planner for Dorothea Dix Park said that the ideas for the park are to expand it as much as possible and to integrate it with the city of Raleigh as well as the NC State campus PERIOD

The park has the potential to be North Carolinas Central Park Pearce said PERIOD We are working with a firm that has designed numerous other successful parks such as the Brooklyn Bridge Park and Hudson River Park PERIOD It is rare that a city has a chance to work with such a large green space within the city borders. with the parks proximity to NC State via a proposed land bridge to Pullen Park faculty staff and students will have easy access as well PERIOD

Alex Depolt a secondyear in textile engineering said that he values how the history of the city can be seen at the park PERIOD

I enjoy the beauty of the park and also how it has integrated itself into Raleigh Depolt said PERIOD The park has so much such as the old high school and other buildings and has maintained its history. the firm and the city of Raleigh are currently twothirds of the way through a yearlong planning period of design modifications to the park PERIOD Greenway paths have also been proposed in the design to connect the State Farmers Market to the park as well PERIOD

While making modifications an important focus the team has is to make sure the park honors its history and also represents the Triangle area and North Carolina as a whole PERIOD With  buildings spread across the landscape it has not been determined whether all of them will be kept PERIOD Ideas bounced around have included modifying some to covered basketball courts public spaces and museums PERIOD

The nonprofit Dix Park Conservancy has served as philanthropic partners to help get the project off the ground and has reached out to the community through discussion forums to find out the communitys ideas for the park PERIOD Two community meetings have been held thus far in which the design team presented their vision and responded to feedback from the community PERIOD

The park should be designed by everyone said Pearce PERIOD We are continuing to work on building public awareness to the project and have hosted events such as movie night and an adult Easter egg hunt to help people to engage more and support the park. the park is also hosting events such as Get Fit at Dix and A Burden Too Great to Bear Dorothea Dix Hospital and the Civil War to get the community involved in the parks history and to continue to build awareness about the park PERIOD

Phase one of the parks construction is projected to begin in spring of  PERIOD For more information about events and how to get involved in the parks planning can be found on the Dorothea Dix Park website PERIOD
