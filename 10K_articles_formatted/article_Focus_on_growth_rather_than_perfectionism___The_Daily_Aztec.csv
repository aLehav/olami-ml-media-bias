Author journalist and opinion columnist Anna Quindlen said the thing that is really hard and really amazing is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself. ive been a hardcore perfectionist ever since I can remember PERIOD I can boldly proclaim from a mountaintop that the outrageous struggle I have with striving to be perfect in literally everything I put my mind to do is exhausting to say the very least PERIOD Being a student leader writer creator the oldest of my siblings and a woman  a woman of color to be frank  chasing perfection in everything I do may be the biggest struggle I face going about my daily life PERIOD

With every word I speak or write every note I play on my keyboard or guitar and practically every project I am apart of there comes an inner obligatory need for me to be flawless PERIOD If what I do doesnt meet my standard of perfection in addition to being disappointed in myself I am beyond uncomfortable with the entire project PERIOD

It wasnt until I got to college that I came to terms with the reality that in my quest and attempts to be perfect in everything I do I wasnt really living PERIOD I continually hindered myself from embracing my very own process of growth by striving for perfectionism PERIOD

Perfectionists like myself spend so much time in an endless pursuit for everything to be perfect PERIOD We end up missing out on what life is really about being present in each moment and experiencing life where we are as we are PERIOD Many people who strive for perfection in their daily lives  wanting to plan it out stepbystep and have it go exactly how they believe it should  end up missing out on some of lifes best surprises and most meaningful moments PERIOD

I too am guilty of this PERIOD

There are times when we try so hard to reach a degree of perfection that is nearly impossible PERIOD However I am learning that perfection cannot be attained PERIOD Agendas change conflicts emerge and it is all inevitable PERIOD

When we begin to understand that perfection isnt actually something we can reach and maintain forever we can finally let go of the neverending quest for perfection with our body our career and our relationships PERIOD Once we indulge in the idea of letting go of perfection life is smoother less stressful and much more enjoyable especially for hardcore perfectionists like me PERIOD

We must also realize that perfection isnt authentic either PERIOD Besides feeling excessive levels of stress pressure and anxiety when perfection is my goal my passion for the things I love to do can get lost in the midst of my strongest attempts to be flawless PERIOD I cant really think of a time where I have given myself the chance to truly be patient with myself in whatever task is at hand while simultaneously attempting to attain perfection PERIOD I thought when Id reached perfection Id find satisfaction in my efforts PERIOD However since the pursuit of perfection is an endless chase the satisfaction never came PERIOD

Only when I had the courage to work toward breaking my perfectionist mindset was I fully able to bring my true self to the world PERIOD This was the first moment I began to find the inner satisfaction I was craving all along PERIOD This process isnt easy or comfortable for me but surely it is incredibly freeing PERIOD

When weve demanded perfection from ourselves for years it can be scary to let go of our customs and let the world see us authentically PERIOD However this is where your true beauty resides not in perfection but in bringing all of who you are to the world PERIOD

Nothing is ever meant to be perfect in life PERIOD If that were the case there would be no such thing as growth and evolution PERIOD Therefore allow yourself to show up in the world as you are PERIOD Allow yourself to make mistakes PERIOD Allow yourself to learn PERIOD Whether you perform badly on a test get into a quarrel with a relative express feelings to a close friend and have it all come out wrong or experiment with a new hobby knowing it is likely one that you will never master embrace this journey PERIOD Mistakes like these turn into lessons that allow us to incorporate feedback and work towards being better people PERIOD

Perfection isnt something you can achieve because it doesnt actually exist PERIOD As I am on this route to shattering my own perfectionist mindset I encourage you to do the same if you share this same struggle PERIOD Rest in the truth that the imperfect flawed vulnerable talented and unique you is enough PERIOD Trading perfectionism for being patient with yourself and in your growth is the first step to becoming you PERIOD
