Newlyweds met through dating app decide to exchange vows in front of Rainbow Guards float

As multiple student organizations prepared for the annual homecoming parade one group set out to transform their float into a particularly memorable scene a wedding venue PERIOD

On Nov PERIOD  Cole Fenwick a former student and Cody Kuhn a sociology sophomore tied the knot in front of Rainbow Guards float in Lot T just before the parade PERIOD

Around  a.m. Zack Gentry a literary studies junior who isordained by the Universal Life Church wed Fenwick and Kuhn PERIOD Only the couples close friends attended the ceremony PERIOD

Fenwick and Kuhn met a year ago on a popular dating app called OkCupid PERIOD They discovered soon after that they both went to UTD and began dating PERIOD

After a year of seeing each other the couple decided to get married PERIOD Originally they planned to go to the courthouse but Adam Richards the president of Rainbow Guard suggested they get married on the homecoming cart PERIOD

It was actually just a happy coincidence PERIOD We decided last week that we wanted to get married and we were just going to go to the courthouse and do it Kuhn said PERIOD But I am also involved with Rainbow Guard and Adam our President said Our float is gay wedding themed so you should get married on it. it was a crisp bright morning when the ecstatic couple stood across from each other PERIOD Groomsmen stood off to the side and held a giant paper rose over their heads PERIOD

As Gentry performed the ceremony Fenwick and Kuhn couldnt help but giggle when their eyes met PERIOD The couple kissed after exchanging vows and the guests cheered PERIOD

Fenwick and Kuhn said they are excited to be married but that telling their parents will be difficult PERIOD

I think were both going to feel a little push back from our parents Kuhn said PERIOD My mom knows and is supportive but my dad is going to flip PERIOD Hes never liked Cole and he is going to say were too young making a mistake dont know what were doing. similarly Fenwick said that he is anxious to tell his family and doesnt want to see his mom cry PERIOD His brother has also never met his partner but Fenwick said he anticipates that he will be supportive PERIOD

Fenwick still remembers the day that gay marriage was legalized PERIOD He recalls crying when he heard the news PERIOD While he said this is a major step in the right direction Fenwick still wants more work to be done in the gay community PERIOD

Same sex marriage is a good starting point but our work is far from over Fenwick said PERIOD Homelessness job loss harassment and suicide are still huge problems in the LGBT community and need to be addressed even more now that same sex marriage is legalized. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
