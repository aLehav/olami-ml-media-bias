City Council member Lorelei Sims rescinded her objection allowing the Historic Preservation Ordinance to pass PERIOD



The area of the ordinance that had disagreement was whether the resident of the homes must approve for the home to become a historical landmark PERIOD Sims objected because she feared that under the language the owner could stop the process by just simply not doing anything PERIOD

The city attorney reworked the language of the clause however PERIOD Sims said the new language was more confusing so she called the mayor and told him that she would withdraw her objection allowing the original ordinance to go through PERIOD

Sims said she talked to residents and other council members and after seeing committee members working on it for three years although it wasnt perfect it was  percent good and that was better than nothing. in other matters Mayor Dan Cougill took time to thank the the homecoming committee and all residents and students for a successful homecoming parade with no major incidents PERIOD

We had three bands we hope to keep adding more and more bands and get it to what it once was Cougill said PERIOD

He said that Eastern President Lou Hencken had called two of the three bands and they had said that they were very appreciative and planning on coming back. in other news the council approved received bids for two different projects rejecting one and accepting the other PERIOD

The lowest bid for the sandblasting and painting of the waste water treatment plant was  but was voted down by the council at the suggestion of Curt Buescher the director of public works PERIOD

He said that the city had to just replace the rough on the waste water treatment plant and because of these and other unexpected costs it was best to hold off the work until next spring PERIOD

Were just being conservative right now he said PERIOD

The city did approve a . bid from Brown traffic products Inc PERIOD from Davenport Iowa to replace the remaining street lights in Charleston with Light Emitting Diode lights PERIOD

Cougill said the lights which the city already has at the intersection of ninth street and Lincoln Avenue are much brighter and are costsaving due to lower maintenance PERIOD
