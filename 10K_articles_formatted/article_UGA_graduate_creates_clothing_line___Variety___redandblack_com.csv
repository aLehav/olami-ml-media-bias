Recent University of Georgia graduate Kyle Green draws inspiration from his experiences as a student to excel in creating his own exclusively Americanmadeclothing company PERIOD

The idea for the company Young Hearted Apparel materialized when he began working at a law firm in the fall PERIOD When he noticed he was spending money on costly products from other countries Green decided to design a clothing company PERIOD Growing up in an expressively artistic family his passion for art and fashion finally found an outlet PERIOD

This idea also fell right inline with some advice one of my cousins gave me earlier that summer PERIOD She reiterated that our family is artistic oriented and if I felt the need to create art I should do so. at the time I scoffed at the idea but months later Young Hearted Apparel was conceptualized Green said PERIOD

Young Hearted Apparels flair and attraction lies in the playful attitude expressed in its products PERIOD The dilemma of graduating from college yet not feeling like a full inspired the mantra mission and name of the company PERIOD Although the company sells a variety of shirts sweatshirts hoodies and even pet wear Greens real mission is in revolutionizing socks PERIOD The struggle between finding socks that were dressy but dull and plain and those that were playful but cheaplymade motivated him to differentiate the socks Young Hearted Apparel would produce from similar companies PERIOD

I was hard pressed to find a playful sock of high quality PERIOD I figured I would set out to fill this void PERIOD This is why you have the Saturday Morning sock influenced by Saved by the Bell and cartoons that aired on Saturdays or The Hunt sock influenced by my collection of National Geographic. after the creation of The Hunt design the ideas started to flow like a waterfall and they havent stopped since Green said PERIOD

The company uses only highgrade materials that are American made for all of its products and packaging PERIOD Additionally it is partnered with one of the largest Drifit manufacturers in North America responsible for the manufacturing of the companys lightweight running shirts PERIOD

My favorite part of the company and the most unique aspect outside of the packaging is the fact that the official MLB sock manufacturer makes our socks PERIOD This partnership allows me to fill the void I previously mentioned giving the wearer a highend sock with playful graphics Green said PERIOD

However many challenges are involved in running exclusively Americanmade companies PERIOD Production costs in America are higher than in other countries typically used for production not only increasing the price of merchandise but making it difficult for business owners to negotiate with retailers who are also dealing with cheaper competition outside the United States PERIOD

Producing it outside of America was one thing I wouldnt bend on PERIOD The U.S PERIOD apparel manufacturing industry has seen such a loss and with the economy and outsourcing being a major talking point in the last election there was no way I was going to follow in the footsteps of other fashion companies with regard to this issue. not to mention one of the main reasons I created this company was to make everything within our country using domestic materials Green said PERIOD

Greens goals for his upandcoming company begin with running a successful Kickstarter campaign in the next week PERIOD The funds raised from this campaign will aid the company in producing the remainder of its sock designs as well as transitioning all apparel to organic cotton PERIOD Likewise he has hopes of introducing 1980s Flash Dance inspired leg warmers to the companys array of colorful lighthearted footwear PERIOD

Yet behind this plethora of inspiration Greens experiences as a UGA student greatly aided in the development of his company PERIOD The partying atmosphere stimulated his desire to have fun which Green found plenty of at UGA PERIOD When faced with life decisions Green considers what will bring him happiness PERIOD The experiences of his childhood as well as those at UGA prove to Green that he will never grow out of his Young Hearted mindset or outlook on life PERIOD

This is not to say that the professors did not have an influence on me because they did PERIOD They are the ones who prepared me and gave me the tools and confidence to enter the professional world but it is the student body and friendships I formed that spurred the mindset for the conceptualization of Young Hearted Apparel Green said PERIOD
