From smashed fruit to Chicagostyle jazz the show resembled just that PERIOD

Exit Sixteen the senior dance concert was held in the Bob Hope Theatre in Meadows School of the Arts on April  PERIOD The twohour concert began at  p.m PERIOD

The concert was  but was free for students with an SMU student ID according to a representative working at the Meadows ticket office Friday night PERIOD

The show included nine pieces with a short intermission PERIOD The pieces were entirely choreographed by the SMU senior dancers with the oversight of their teacher Christopher Dolder PERIOD All senior dance majors at SMU are required to take this class as their final capstone PERIOD

The concert began with a dramatic piece called Creep and ended with a creative fruitsmashing piece called The Flowers in the Front Yard are Dying. the nine pieces consisted of contemporary tap pointe and jazz dance styles PERIOD

Each piece had a different story and meaning to it PERIOD

I really enjoyed the show PERIOD It made me think in ways I have never thought before said SMU student Will OConnor PERIOD

The lighting props and costumes were all organized and chosen by the students as part of their capstone class PERIOD Each student in the senior dance class was responsible for a part of the show PERIOD

Dolder the artistic director and faculty mentor sat near the front entrance at a table where tshirts for the event were being sold PERIOD

Gracie Singer a junior dance minor who attended the show was excited to see her friends perform in one of their final performances as seniors at SMU PERIOD

The SMU senior dance class worked the entire semester alongside their teacher to end the year with a successful senior dance concert PERIOD
