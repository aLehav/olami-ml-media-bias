The UConnwomenscross country team travels to Boston today as they bid for a spot at the NCAA National Championship PERIOD Led by outgoing senior standout Mia Nahom the Huskies look to improve on their last showing at the NCAA Regional Championship which saw them finishing ninth PERIOD

For regionals the strategy is the same well just have to find each other and move up. nahom said PERIOD

High off their finish ahead of Providence at the Big East Championship two weeks ago UConn will have to fend off stiff competition from No PERIOD  Syracuse coming into regionals as the top team in the Northeast PERIOD In what would be a first in program history a confident coach Lindsay Crevoiserat has no doubts in the teams chances of clinching a berth to the National Championship as one of the two automatic qualifiers PERIOD

The common factor in the field among Providence Syracuse and us is that were all top  teams weve beaten both teams before so its going to come down to which team has the best day said Crevoiserat PERIOD This is a big field so once we get up front we just need to find Syracuse and Providence and just huntsince were better when we can see our competition she said PERIOD

The Huskies have had a commendable season following a strong start at their first meet the Marist Invitational in September which saw the team taking the top spot out of seven PERIOD UConn also secured a win at the Ken OBrien Minuteman Invitational and had top five finishes at the CoasttoCoast Battle in Beantown and the recently concluded Big East Championship PERIOD

Following her conference honorsearning performance in Carmel Ind. freshman Chloe Thomas has gotten a confidence boost ahead of Regionals PERIOD Im really looking forward to Regionals this Friday PERIOD Its a great opportunity for myself and the team to showcase the training and work weve been putting in together since August she said PERIOD Before Big Easts Coach Lindsay and I decided on a strategy that worked really well for me so having that strategy in my back pocket gives me a lot of confidence for our upcoming race she said PERIOD

UConn goes into the Regional Championship ranked third behind Syracuse and Providencewho are ranked No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  respectively PERIOD The top five is completed by former champions Harvard and Yale who are ranked No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  respectively PERIOD
