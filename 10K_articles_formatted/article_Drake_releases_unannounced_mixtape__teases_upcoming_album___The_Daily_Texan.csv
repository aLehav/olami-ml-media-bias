5983,2023-07-11,"with his fourth album Views from The  coming down the pipeline Drake has a great year ahead of him PERIOD On top of the album he went and pulled a Beyonc releasing an unannounced mixtape titled If Youre Reading This Its Too Late on iTunes PERIOD The move caused his almost  million Twitter followers to clamor in excitement PERIOD Is this just another piece for Drakes catalogue or does it have replay value

Drake who has been teasing new content for months has not said what exactly If Youre Reading This Its Too Late is PERIOD Is this a mixtape as all of Drakes social media teasing has suggested Is it an album with conceptual weight to justify its cost Is this some sort of hybrid of the two meant to fight back against Cash Money Records and Birdman to free Drake from his contracts So far no one seems
to know PERIOD

One thing is obvious right off the bat This isnt the Drake were used to hearing PERIOD Drake was never a raw artist this might be the closest hes ever come to that status PERIOD The production is minimal compared to what I consider to be Drakes best work PERIOD

The most upbeat song of the mixtape is Legend PERIOD This is classic Drake at his best with familiar beats and rhymes that work well together PERIOD Drake hits the ground running declaring If I die Im a legend. after this somewhat reflective track everything
becomes much darker PERIOD

The best track on the mixtape You  The  is an open letter from Drake to his mother PERIOD He thanks her for raising him properly and touts her resiliency PERIOD The last song 6PM In New York lifts the albums gloomy vibe PERIOD Drake proves his skill with confident approach and complex rhymes PERIOD

This mixtape does have its bad moments however PERIOD On the second track Drake raps Bout to call your ass an Uber I got somewhere to be. drake you can do better than that PERIOD Jungle didnt work well either given Drakes usually
topnotch singing PERIOD

I enjoyed listening to If Youre Reading This Its Too Late but I dont think Ill ever listen to it again PERIOD Its not that it was bad it just doesnt seem to have any replay value PERIOD Drake wrote this for some selfcontemplation and an opportunity for the listener to reflect as well but its not something I would go back to PERIOD

The truth is I just want the album PERIOD This just feels like a prelude PERIOD After listening to this mixtape Im looking forward to what Drake will release in the coming months PERIOD
