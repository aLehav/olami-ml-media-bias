This past Tuesday Florida State University had to indefinitely suspend all fraternity and sorority activities throughout campus in response to the death of a student during a pledging term PERIOD John Thrasher FSUs president commented on the decision stating that Greek life activities will remain suspended for as long as it takes for the students to adopt a new culture in regards to fraternities and sororities PERIOD Although this case is the most recent one it is not the only tragedy as hazingrelated incidents have become all too common PERIOD Because of this universities should take a different approach in regulating fraternities PERIOD



Last February Penn State University ceased Greek life parties that provided alcohol after the death of a 19yearold student PERIOD At Louisiana State University the death of a fraternity pledge caused the school to halt Greek life activities for an entire week PERIOD Even here at NYU our chapters of Phi Gamma Delta FIJI and Pi Kappa Alpha PIKE have been suspended for five years due to hazing allegations PERIOD



However the simple shutdown of a fraternity may not be enough to stop the dangers that come with participating in Greek life PERIOD It is unlikely that FSUs Greek life will cease to be active PERIOD When a fraternity or sorority is shut down by the administration at any college members rarely stop holding parties or initiating new members  they simply go underground PERIOD When this happens underground frat parties and initiation events become far more dangerous because without regulations and a risk of punishment hazing can go unchecked PERIOD This is because there is little universitysanctioned incentive to contact the proper authorities or emergency services should a dangerous situation arise PERIOD The benefits of properly regulating Greek life with common sense policy far outweigh the risks of paving the way for it to go unrestrained PERIOD



While we agree that Greek organizations accused of misconduct should be punished and regulated cutting ties with them completely is the wrong approach PERIOD The FSU administration stated that they would allow the organizations to continue activities after the school develops new regulations and practices but this should have been the first step PERIOD Universities should ensure clear communication between Greek life and the administration PERIOD Furthermore a scheduled checkin system with all oncampus frats and sororities would also greatly benefit the safety standards in Greek life PERIOD Closing down a fraternity or suspending its activities as the immediate consequence would not fundamentally fix the problems that lead to tragedies  the frats will mostly be driven to operate by themselves PERIOD That being the case an active Greek life that is not officially sanctioned and monitored by the university can turn out to be more dangerous for student life PERIOD
