By  Brian ThomasOctober  

NIU mens soccer picked up a win Sunday as it took down MAC opponent Florida Atlantic  PERIOD

It was a big win for the Huskies   MAC as it was senior day as well PERIOD

Brad Horton Johnny Tyma Kenny Kranz Finn Jor Tim King Francis Otira and Pat Sloan were the seven seniors to be recognized by NIU PERIOD

Obviously its a big day for us Horton said PERIOD I think it really meant a lot to all of the seniors to win the game and we were glad to get the win. eric Luzzi NIU head mens soccer coach said he was happy the seniors were able to get a win on their special day but he was not as pleased with the performance of his squad PERIOD

To be honest its more relief than happiness Luzzi said PERIOD Today the performance was very very subpar for our standards PERIOD So the fact that we got the result in spite of the performanceIm happy for the seniors but its more relief to be honest because the game should have gone much differently. nIU sophomore James Stevenson scored the lone goal for NIU in the fortieth minute just before the end of the first half PERIOD It was assisted by freshman Jayson LeSeth on a free kick PERIOD

The goal gives Stevenson five on the year and three in the Huskies last two games PERIOD

Thats what he does hes a goal scorer PERIOD Hes a striker Luzzi said PERIOD And even when he doesnt have a perfect day hes going to have a chance to score goals because thats what he does. the Huskies had a good chance to add another goal on a penalty kick in the fifty-third minute but Owls goalkeeper Jeremy Crumpton blocked Hortons shot PERIOD

The defense was strong in the game and was a key to NIUs victory PERIOD

Huskies goalkeeper Jordan Godsey earned his eighth shutout of the season and had three saves in the match PERIOD

The Huskies earned their second straight win against a MAC opponent PERIOD

Its massive Luzzi said PERIOD If were  after today were in trouble PERIOD  puts us right back in the hunt PERIOD I expect that we will keep moving forward and we will get ready for Bowling Green which will be another challenging game on Saturday. advertisement
