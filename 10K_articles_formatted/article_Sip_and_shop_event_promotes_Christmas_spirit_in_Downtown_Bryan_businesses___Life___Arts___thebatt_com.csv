Events coordinator Hannah Hernandez helped organize this years festive occasion as a part of the Downtown Bryan Associations mission to bring people into the historic downtown sector PERIOD

Around BryanCollege Station its the only one of its kind Hernandez said PERIOD There are not really any other sip and shops like this where you get to go inside of all different businesses and see everything decorated for Christmastime so its very unique for our little area. participating businesses such as Birds Nest Gifts and Antiques run by owner Robin Kenney will open their doors for this event and provide wine samples and homemade wassail to visitors as they wander the stores PERIOD

Theyre having a good time and its interesting to introduce the wassail Kenney said PERIOD We have kind of a fun fruitytype wassail and they like it and they want to share the recipe PERIOD Its like shopping was years ago where you came to downtown and you wandered from store to store and I like that. to add to the festive atmosphere all of the streets were lit up with Christmas lights at last Fridays Lights On event signalling the beginning of the Christmas season in Downtown Bryan just in time for Small Business Saturday PERIOD

I truly think its just so fun to walk around downtown especially when its cold and you get to see all the lights around you Hernandez said PERIOD It just works out perfectly that its on Small Business Saturday and its right after Thanksgiving so everyones kicking off their Christmas shopping so we hope that this event will spur people to come out and shop small business for their Christmas presents. the Kolache Capital one of the  businesses hosting Wine and Wassail is a traditional Czech bakery situated in Downtown Bryan run by owner Millicent Tausch PERIOD Tausch said Downtown Bryan has a hometown feel especially during Christmas PERIOD

Its very merry very jolly and everybodys participating Tausch said PERIOD People enjoy coming in and tasting wine and eating baked goods and then going to the next place and experience what they have so its a neat event PERIOD You get to know your customers and you get to know all the other merchants and it feels like a big family. in addition to Wine and Wassail the Downtown Bryan Association is hosting other holiday events such as the December First Friday Lighted Christmas Parade and showings of classic Christmas movies in the historic Queen Theatre PERIOD

I just think that sharing what we have going on is super fun Hernandez said PERIOD I dont know if theres any better way to promote the Christmas spirit than being in a really small downtown thats all decorated for Christmas with Christmas lights everywhere and getting to talk to the owners of these stores and see their hearts behind why they decorated their store like this specifically for Christmas. tickets can be purchased online for  prior to the event PERIOD On the day of tickets can be purchased during checkin at the Palace Theater for  PERIOD All patrons must be  years old or older PERIOD
