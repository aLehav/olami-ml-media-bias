A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version



Interview conducted by Caroline Traylor





I graduated from UTSA in December  just a few months before starting my current job PERIOD I was lucky enough to be involved in some great student organizations PERIOD I was Executive Senator of the SGA involved in the Public Administration Student Organization MOVE UTSA and FTK Dance Marathon for a little while there PERIOD I definitely had the opportunity to be a part of some of the best student organizations on campus and Im sure there are some that Im forgetting PERIOD



Well three months after graduating I got my current job as Chief of Staff to City Councilman Ron Nirenberg who represents UTSA PERIOD Hes such a big supporter of the university its cool to get to work on behalf of my alma mater in a professional environment PERIOD Local politics are interesting because in Texas theyre supposed to be nonpartisan PERIOD So we try to get things done without thinking about partisan hangups which is very different from other levels of government PERIOD And most of the things we work on are the basics of peoples lives PERIOD Streets sidewalks public transit police and fire PERIOD Its a cool level of politics to work on because we have an impact on what regular people see day to day PERIOD



I had several mentors in my time at UTSA but the one that really stands out is Dr PERIOD Ann Eisenberg PERIOD As the Associate Dean of the Honors College she pushed me towards some really important experiences in my life PERIOD In particular she helped me to apply for the Archer Fellowship program something Id recommend for any student involved in politics and policy PERIOD Dr PERIOD Eisenberg has such incredible knowledge of UTSA and truly had a desire to make sure that my student experience was unique and suited for me PERIOD I cant begin to thank her PERIOD



UTSA gave me an incredible network locally PERIOD I still work with former professors and people I met in classes every day PERIOD Mayor Ivy Taylor was one of my professors PERIOD Thats one of the things that I think makes UTSA and San Antonio unique PERIOD San Antonio is such a small town in some ways but when you form a tightknit network you can get a lot done PERIOD So thats one of the ways I think UTSA prepared me for the challenges I am facing in my career and otherwise PERIOD It gave me a great network PERIOD



I was born and raised in San Antonio PERIOD Ive been involved in local politics because I love this city and there are so many big challenges I want to help fix PERIOD We have low rates of social mobility and low rates of civic engagement PERIOD But San Antonio is made up of fundamentally decent hardworking people and I think we are a city with so much potential PERIOD I want to make a difference in my city PERIOD I dont know what that looks likefrom the public private or nonprofit sectorbut I think no matter where I go Ill always come back to my home city and aspire to help lift it up PERIOD Other than that I kind of want to open up a restaurant karaoke bar some day PERIOD



My best advice would be to throw yourself into whatever youre doing PERIOD What I mean by that is do whatever youre doing to the fullest extent that you can do it PERIOD You never know what benefit youre going to get out of an experience so no matter what it is that you like to do do it full out PERIOD You will only get out of something what you put into it so invest your time PERIOD Invest your heart PERIOD Invest your whole self in whatever it is that youre doing and it will serve you better over the long term PERIOD
