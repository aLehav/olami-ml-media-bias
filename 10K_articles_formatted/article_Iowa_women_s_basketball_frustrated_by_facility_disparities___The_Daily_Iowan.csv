SAN ANTONIO  Ahead of the NCAA Division I Womens Basketball Tournament the NCAA received backlash by womens basketball players and coaches for disparities between weight rooms constructed for the mens teams and the womens teams PERIOD

In Indianapolis where the mens basketball tournament is based each team received a weight room that featured a flurry of dumbbells squat racks and other workout equipment PERIOD

The womens teams which are in San Antonio received a rack of dumbbells up to  pounds and yoga mats PERIOD

There were also noticeable discrepancies in the quality of food and the merchandise compared to the mens tournament PERIOD

After womens basketball players spoke out about the difference in weight rooms the NCAA acknowledged the lackluster weights and pledged to upgrade the equipment PERIOD

We have intentionally organized basketball under one umbrella at the NCAA to ensure consistency and collaboration said Dan Gavitt the NCAA senior vice president of basketball in a release PERIOD When we fall short on those expectations its on me PERIOD I apologize to the womens basketball studentathletes coaches and the womens basketball committee for dropping the ball on the weight rooms in San Antonio. as of Saturday morning the womens basketball teams weight rooms were upgraded with additional dumbbells racks and cardio equipment PERIOD

As an athlete that has experienced the weight room firsthand junior center Monika Czinano appreciates the womens players who have spoken out about the disparities PERIOD

Im just really really proud of the women athletes Ive seen Czinano said PERIOD And the coaches and just women in general who have been stepping forward to talk about it Im just hoping that the more and more recognition that gets brought to it the more the nation will see that stuff like that really isnt OK. despite the lackluster facilities the Hawkeyes have been staying in shape PERIOD Czinano mentioned the teams strength and conditioning coach Lindsay Alexander has been good at getting creative in workouts for the team PERIOD

For Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder it was more of the same PERIOD

Some of those things that you see between the mens and the womens tournaments its like Here we go again Bluder said PERIOD It gets frustrating PERIOD It gets very frustrating PERIOD

As women leaders we have to make sure that all teams are treated the same and treated well in these situations PERIOD And a lot of people are using their voices and again as female leaders thats what were encouraging PERIOD We want our women to use their platforms and speak out for when things are not right because for too long too many people didnt speak out when something was wrong. bluder isnt optimistic the brief attention will create significant change for womens basketball PERIOD But its a start PERIOD

I guess Ive been around the game long enough to know it takes more than a little bit of media attention for  to  hours to make change Bluder said PERIOD I hope it makes a difference and it needs to its a generation of women right now that are determined to make a change. fifthseeded Iowa kicks off the NCAA Tournament Sunday morning at  a.m PERIOD against No PERIOD  seed Central Michigan at the Alamodome in San Antonio PERIOD The game will air on ESPN PERIOD
