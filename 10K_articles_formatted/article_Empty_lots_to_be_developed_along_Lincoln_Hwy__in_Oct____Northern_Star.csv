Two empty lots on West Lincoln Highway are set to see some development after being vacant for some time PERIOD

There will be development in addition to a ground breaking on the lot within the next two weeks to a month said Rob Walters owner of the lot and the general manager of Insight Real Estate Development PERIOD The plans for the lot include a twobuilding shopping center and retail space PERIOD

No leases or contracts have been signed to date but Walters said Starbucks and Panda Express have expressed interest in opening stores on the lots which are next to Copy Service  W PERIOD Lincoln Highway PERIOD

Walters said he is not exactly sure how long the lots have been vacant but he said they had been yacant for some time before he and his company purchased them PERIOD

The grass on the empty lot is at least shinhigh on the average person PERIOD

To prevent the lot from becoming an eyesore to the passersby on Lincoln Highway Walters hired a maintenance crew to take care of the lot PERIOD
