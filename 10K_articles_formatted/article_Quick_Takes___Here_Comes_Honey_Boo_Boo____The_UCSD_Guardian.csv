The TLC reality TV show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo is a semicomedic documentary about the family of child beauty contestant Alana Thompson nicknamed Honey Boo Boo who became famous in  when she appeared on the reality series Toddlers and Tiaras. this program unfairly makes a spectacle out of life in rural America by highlighting unhealthy living and dysfunctionality PERIOD

The makers of the show constantly try to demean the characters through unfair cinematic techniques PERIOD The producers devote over half of runtime in the third episode to the Thompsons greasy cooking habits PERIOD Extreme closeup shots of dirty dishes and sizzling butter on a pan get a full five minutes of coverage PERIOD Though the point of this was ostensibly to explore Alanas dietary habits it was actually a cheap attempt to take the mundane and make it a circus of the bizarre PERIOD

The show frequently glosses over Alanas discipline PERIOD The narrator only mentions in passing that she practices her modeling routine for three hours a day and instead the show spends nearly  minutes on Alanas bellysqueezing antics PERIOD

Though Alanas family members are not ashamed of themselves the makers of this program portray them like they should be PERIOD To improve their shows ratings the producers attempt to portray the Thompsons in a grotesque and skewed way PERIOD

Reality Show is Just Entertainment

The unanticipated success of TLCs new reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has come under fire for unfairly lampooning the familys relative poverty and lifestyle PERIOD This criticism however is misplaced PERIOD

Honey Boo Boo is hardly the first reality television show to depict polarizing child behavior  the  Kids and Counting series has also elicited everything in the spectrum from scorn to acclaim PERIOD Huffington Post article notes that the family receives upwards of  for each episode enough for the family to forge a more comfortable life PERIOD

Although the characters may appear vacuous it is important to recognize their qualities PERIOD In fact comedian Rosie ODonnell declared her genuine admiration for Thompsons presence and intellect in an interview with People Magazine PERIOD Despite the sometimesobjectionable lifestyle choices the exceptional strength of the familys affection for one another is a model for others PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD is hardly a homogeneous nation  television programming should reflect its variance from quintessential suburbia by balancing representations of wealth and privilege with the thrifty and culturally dissimilar lives of families such as the Thompsons PERIOD

Fame Will Destroy Little Girls Life

Lindsay Lohan the Olsen twins and Amanda Bynes were once bright child stars PERIOD Now as they find themselves entering adulthood those adorable memories we had of them are being replaced with ones of anorexia drug abuse and mental instability PERIOD Alana Thompson is unknowingly on this path PERIOD If the public her family and the TV network dont wake up her life may very well spiral into disaster PERIOD

Captivating or not Thompson is carelessly being deployed as a child soldier in the entertainment industry PERIOD Child psychologists and doctors alike emphasize the importance of creating authentic friendships as a kid PERIOD Thompson like many child stars before her is being deprived from forming these crucial relationships PERIOD Former child star Christopher Knight of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch attested to this remarking that there exist people who only pretend to be child stars friends solely because of their stardom PERIOD

Thompson will have plenty of time to chase money and flaunt her looks later in life PERIOD Her mother should be telling her to play outside not to shake her butt PERIOD The celebrity bubble developing around Thompson is not nurturing a star but rather starving a child who may never get the chance to achieve her full potential and grow into a normal adult PERIOD
