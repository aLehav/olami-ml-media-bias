New students see all the dining locations on Southeasterns campus during orientation including Cayman Caf Taco Bell Popeyes Chickfila etc PERIOD But they likely will have no idea where to get frozen custard or farmfresh produce until their senior year PERIOD Auxiliary Services partnered with the Office of Multicultural and International Student Affairs to create a map detailing the locations of restaurants general stores and markets within a mile of campus PERIOD

While the map is certainly of use to the general student population it is targeted towards students without transportation especially international students PERIOD

The reason we created the map is that some of the students staying on campus without transportation expressed that theyve had difficulty finding convenient food and dining options particularly when the on campus dining facilities are closed said Brendan Daigle coordinator for MISA PERIOD We are hoping that by providing this map we are educating students on the wide variety of restaurants and food stores that are close to campus thereby alleviating this issue. pJs Coffee Kirin Sushi Jovannis Food Market and Trey Yuen are among the  restaurants and food options featured in the map PERIOD All of the locations are less than a mile from the university the furthest being Johnnys Pizza . miles and the closest being a threeway tie between Campus Convenience Rendes and Smoothie King less than . miles PERIOD Most of the locations are located within Downtown Hammond which begins half a mile from the southern edge of campus PERIOD

According to the Director of Marketing and Strategic Initiatives for Auxiliary Services Robin Rodrigue there are plans for some of these locations to accept Cub Cash PERIOD However a list of locations has not yet been finalized though Auxiliary Services plans on promoting the new service during Traditions August  PERIOD Look for more information regarding the use of Lions Lagniappe in Hammond stores and restaurants in the upcoming issues of The Lions Roar PERIOD

Editors Note  Aug PERIOD   This story has been corrected to reflect that Lions Lagniappe not Cub Cash will be accepted as payment by stores and restaurants around campus PERIOD
