A scene from Firewatch a video game with a plot about hiking PERIOD FlickrK putt

Its the middle of the night and youre alone in the woods PERIOD The trees which seemed full of life during the day sit dead and the mountains which looked so beckoning hours earlier are now grim reminders of the fact that youre trapped PERIOD This is the world of Firewatch one of the most compelling hiking simulators Ive ever experienced PERIOD

The 80s were a weird time and no one knows that better than protagonist and avid hiker Henry PERIOD The opening explains that Henry fell in love with Julia only for her to develop early onset Alzheimers PERIOD The opening text actually does something unique by making the player click responses like it gets worse to progress through it which feels horrible as though the player is becoming complicit in the diseases rampage PERIOD There are also a couple of choices that while meaningless still make the player invested in Henrys story PERIOD

The traumatic ordeal eventually results in Julia being taken away by her parents and Henry subsequently takes a job at Shoshone national park as a fire watcher PERIOD The only other sign of life is Delilah a fellow lookout who communicates orders and talks with Henry about his life through a small yellow walkietalkie PERIOD

The writing in this game is superb and it had better be since Delilah is the only other human being for miles PERIOD You get the sense that both of these characters are running from something in their past and their chemistry is fantastic PERIOD

Even days after completing the game Delilah sticks out to me as one of the best female characters that have ever been written in gaming PERIOD She displays an absolute rainbow of emotions as the game progresses from funny and sarcastic to angry and even a little paranoid depicting each one in a believable and engaging way PERIOD Delilah is just a great character from her voice acting to her writing and she really carries this game at times PERIOD

That brings us to the meat of the game which is hiking around the national park PERIOD There are caves to explore hills to climb and vistas to gawk at but over time Henry and Delilah begin to discover something a little more sinister is going on PERIOD The pacing of the game is brilliant as it ramps up the paranoia factor slowly but steadily until both the player and the protagonist are both looking over their shoulder and questioning reality PERIOD

The main downside to this game is that theres just not a lot to do in the park PERIOD Delilah will call you and give you an objective halfway across the entire map and then the only thing to do is trek over there and wait for more dialogue PERIOD The park is so big though and invisible walls so prominent that youll often find yourself fumbling with the map and backtracking because you made a wrong turn and went a mile down the wrong trail PERIOD

However the writing makes the whole journey worth it PERIOD I dont think Ive ever played a game that made me laugh recoil and shed a tear all in the span of a few hours but Firewatch accomplishes just that PERIOD Once you start unraveling the mystery youre compelled to keep playing just to find out how it ends a testament to the games writing PERIOD

Once you actually get to that ending however most players will probably feel its a disappointment PERIOD No spoilers but the big reveal is severely underwhelming compared to what I was imaging in my head and the game ends with very little closure for Delilah and Henry PERIOD A couple of side characters are suddenly thrust to the forefront but I never cared as much for random people I never met as I did for the two main characters PERIOD

Firewatch is part of an increasingly large genre of games that has mediocre gameplay but excels at writing and storytelling PERIOD Although I was frequently bored in the early chapters of the game when the mystery hasnt been introduced its worth it to experience the kind of paranoia that a game can deliver under the right circumstances PERIOD

Although the ending is disappointing I dont regret the journey I took with Firewatch for a second PERIOD Its a great example of what games can show us about our own psyche and how you react to what can only be described as oppressive isolation and loneliness will probably reveal a lot about yourself as well PERIOD
