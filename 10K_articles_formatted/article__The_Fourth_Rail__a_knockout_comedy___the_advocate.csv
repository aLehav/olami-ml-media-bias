I attended every performance of The Fourth Rail this past Friday yet I wish I could see it again Mal Cherifi and Shaquille Stewart did a fantastic job taking their concept of who am I looking at and turning it into production that had me laughing crying and anxious for more PERIOD

The play began with lights flickering as we go through a tunnel the barreling sounds of a train car and the jerk and sway of the passengers PERIOD The lights sound and acting came together perfectly to immediately put us on a metro car with strangers PERIOD Jonathan Miot is late for work and no one holds the door for him despite his screams as the train rolls away PERIOD

Though the cast has a mere nine members we meet well over  strangers throughout the show PERIOD Certainly the most enjoyable aspect of the show was watching each actor make lightening quick transitions from one character to the next PERIOD Christian Herrera made the first of those transitions as he went from being a confused Spanishspeaking old man directly into a foolish coworker on his way to an important meeting PERIOD His stark contrast between characters reinforced the plays theme who am I looking at. conor Scanlan gives a heartfelt performance as he rescues his daughters friend from a terrible fate PERIOD He stumbles upon her and she divulges that she has been sleeping on metros here and there for the past several weeks because she was kicked out of her house for getting pregnant PERIOD Scanlan is not acting the adult in this emotional scene but rather he becomes the character PERIOD Audience members rave Conor was phenomenal accomplished sophisticated tender and sweet. the costuming here was also brilliantly done PERIOD The tan jacket with the suede elbow patches immediately informed the audience who Scanlan was and what he was all about PERIOD

Cherifi and Stewart made an excellent decision placing the shows funniest scene of all directly after the most emotional one PERIOD And again the audience gets to see the actors make amazing transitions PERIOD Scanlan sits with his fire engine red turndial cord phone attempting to get service PERIOD Humorous enough but then the stranger beside him informs him that she is equally frustrated with her phone and from her backpack pulls out a twopiece gold phone from the 1920s PERIOD Kelsey Jenkins is to be commended as props master PERIOD

Rory Beckett and Taylor Payne steal the show in  Inches. two drunk teenage BFFLs discuss alcohol boys parties sex shopping and more PERIOD Their comedic timing is flawless PERIOD They feed off one anothers energy building up to Becketts tirade about a kissing betrayal and storming away ending their status as BFFLs. the scene is stolen with James Nelsons perfectly timed question to break the silence following Becketts dramatic exit What the fucks a BFFL

Awa Secka then joins Nelson as they head off for a typical date PERIOD However we quickly learn Nelson is actually Paulina the drag queen PERIOD Nelson is hilarious as he attempts to remain incognito from his very insistent fan Christina Shields and hide his secret from his illinformed date PERIOD Cherifi and Stewart needed to step in and give the scene a bit more push PERIOD The concept was good but was lacking energy and purpose of the two female characters PERIOD

Awa Unshaved examines personal bubbles PERIOD What is appropriate for the public eye and what is not PERIOD It was funny and well done however I would have liked to see it go more indepth PERIOD

Rory Beckett and James Nelson are perfect in Safe Sex as the old lady and teenage partygoer respectively PERIOD They both embody their characters fully PERIOD Their spontaneous connection on the metro with Becketts surprise ending left the audience roaring PERIOD

Jonathan Miot is brilliant in Forever Alone. his misery and outrage is something the entire audience can connect with PERIOD He spies couple after couple being happy and in love until he eventually cant take it and screams out What thefuck

The play is brilliant hilarious emotional and thoughtprovoking PERIOD I cannot wait to see what comes of it when it is workshopped towards the end of April PERIOD Congratulations to this fantastic cast and crew
