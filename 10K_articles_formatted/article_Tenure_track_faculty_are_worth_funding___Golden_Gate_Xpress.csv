1468,2023-11-04,"in a bid to pad metrics that justify their sixfigure salaries SF State administrators have repurposed funds meant to improve the wellbeing of the campus community to instead increase class offerings on a shortterm basis in an effort to boost graduation rates PERIOD

The state legislature granted CSU  milion of ongoing funds last year to increase the number of tenuretrack faculty at the systems
 campuses PERIOD Lawmakers viewed this goal as so vital they dedicated  of the funds allocated to CSUs Graduation Initiative  to hiring  new tenuretrack professors five of which were supposed go to SF State PERIOD But administrators in the provosts office had other plans PERIOD

Its important to understand that tenuretrack faculty contribute to the academic community in ways lecturers who are generally parttime cant PERIOD While SF State has highly skilled and expert lecturers they are less involved in their departments and the campus community than instructors PERIOD The presence of fulltime tenuretrack faculty on campus provide students with additional support continuity and mentorship as they go through their college careers and beyond PERIOD These professors take on a variety of responsibilities not incumbent upon lecturers PERIOD They
participate in curriculum development student advising and research in their fields PERIOD They are also required to maintain involvement in committees and shared governance of the University PERIOD

Provost Jennifer Summit said SF State is within the law in using the  CSU apportioned to the school to hire five new tenuretrack faculty on instead enhancing class offerings but the legislative language contradicts her claim PERIOD

The legislative budget intent could not be more clear this money shall be used for this purpose and this purpose only California Faculty Association Field Representative Maureen Loughran said PERIOD If theyre using it for anything else then theyre breaking the law PERIOD Plain and simple. tenuretrack density throughout the CSU system has been declining as professors retire or move on before reaching tenure which led the CFA towork with the state legislature budget committee to rejuvenate the campus populations of these vital communitymembers PERIOD

Summit says the University plans to hire the five tenure track professors by the time theyre required to report back to the legislature in Nov PERIOD  but the increase of class offerings is taking priority over the moneys intended purpose PERIOD

Someone close to the legislature told Xpress there is no scenario in which SF State can apply these funds to any function that wont increase tenuretrack faculty density PERIOD

Summit thinks the legislature wont require the University to show its work so long as they make the hires before the deadline PERIOD

She also claims that hiring cycles wont allow SF State to begin searching but the budget language actually suggests universities give serious consideration to offering these positions to lecturers already teaching here PERIOD

I think were uniquely noncompliant at SF State CFA SF State Chapter President James Martel PERIOD I know Chico used the money to do five
lecturer conversions and because we have the lecturers here already if we had done that we could have had that money today and had these people start in September. the Chancellor distributed the money last October and Sonoma State announced it would be doubling its tenuretrack searches from eight
to  in light of the additional funding PERIOD Other schools like Sacramento State San Jose State and CSU Dominguez Hills combined to post nearly
 tenuretrack job ads PERIOD

Even though SF State has a higher tenuretrack density compared to other CSU campuses adding more classes will not help it reach its goal of
getting student to graduate more quickly PERIOD

Instead let us use the money as it was intended to hire tenuretrack faculty who are more invested in the advancement of programs research and
curriculum so students have the skills needed to succeed in their careers PERIOD
