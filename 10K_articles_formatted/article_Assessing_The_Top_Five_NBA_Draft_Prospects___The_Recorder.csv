After Virginia defeated Texas Tech in the NCAA National Championship now comes the time for the worlds best basketball prospects to enter their names into the NBA Draft PERIOD Here are my top  prospects for the  NBA Draft PERIOD

All stats via sportsreference.com

Williamson had expectations higher than any amateur basketball player since LeBron James going into his freshman season at Duke PERIOD The  Duke season ended with Williamson posting pergame averages of . points . rebounds and . assists while shooting an absurd  percent from the field PERIOD While his jumper is still a workinprogress these numbers won him the John R PERIOD Wooden Award which is awarded to the nations best male player as a freshman PERIOD Not only did Williamson live up to his expectations but has left passing on him in the draft seem like a fireable offense for an NBA General Manager PERIOD

While Morant did not play in a powerfive conference he scorched the Ohio Valley Conference in his sophomore season and averaged . points  assists and . rebounds per game which resulted in him receiving FirstTeam All American honors PERIOD With a developing yet capable jumpshot elite athleticism and high basketball IQ are enough for many to consider him a topthree lock in this years draft PERIOD

Culvers sophomore season was an incredible success both on the court and on draft boards PERIOD Posting averages of . pPG . rPG and . aPG while leading his team to a National Championship appearance and a Big  Championship made scouts believe in his ability to lead a winning team as the best player on both sides of the floor PERIOD Culver boasted a defensive rating of . in  and carried the majority of his teams offense shooting PERIOD Along with statistics and success Culver possesses fluid athleticism and clean shot mechanics which will allow him to transition to the NBA smoothly PERIOD

In a league that values defensive versatility and threepoint shooting as much as anything else Hunter has all of the tools to be a terrific NBA player PERIOD With NBAready measurements of sixfeeteightinches and  pounds Hunter has proven his ability to defend any position one through four with his strength and footspeed PERIOD His numbers may not pop off of the page but his performance in the National Championship included a careerhigh  points PERIOD His star talent also led to multiple clutch shots to keep Virginia alive PERIOD And his defending of Culver in the final minutes of regulation and overtime sealed his topfive prospect status PERIOD

Barrett was the number one ranked recruit ahead of Williamson going into the season PERIOD Barrett had times where his alpha mentality seemed to cost Duke games while also displaying an extreme lack of ambidextrousness PERIOD But he by no means played himself down the prospect ranks PERIOD Barrett still averaged . pPG . rPG and . aPG PERIOD It would surprise no one if Barretts name was called as high as second on draft night but the looming fear is that he may perform more like Andrew Wiggins than Kobe Bryant PERIOD
