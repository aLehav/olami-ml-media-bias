JUSTIN WASHINGTON Evergreen research editorDecember  

WSU researchers received a grant from the M.J PERIOD Murdock Charitable Trust that will fund Eastlick Hall renovations including a new aquatic research facility and the installation of aquatic phenomics system APS technology PERIOD

The facility submitted a grant proposal to the trustin November  to the trust which is a nonprofit organization located in the Pacific Northwest PERIOD Eleven different researchers were on the proposal and it was approved in June  said Erica Crespi principal investigator for the grant and associate professor of biology for the College of Arts and Sciences PERIOD

Researchers also submitted a grant proposal to the National Science Foundation in August so the facility can fund undergraduate summer internships and independent research Crespi said PERIOD

Research within the facility will cover any aquatic animal like invertebrates marine invertebrates and freshwater invertebrates PERIOD It will include research ranging from evolution physiology and ecology Crespi said PERIOD

This is a very unique facility she said PERIOD Theres a lot of facilities like these for zebrafish and then we have specific facilities for trout and salmon PERIOD But the nice thing about this place is that its flexible enough to do research on any aquatic animal. one current research project conducted in the facility is discovering how increasing salts in freshwater systems affects amphibians  this is Crespis main focus PERIOD

The increase in salt is due to runoff from deicing salts used on roads PERIOD Sea level rise and other industrial wastes create salts which make the aquatic environment stressful for amphibians PERIOD The study will investigate how differences in salinity affect amphibian growth she said PERIOD

One of the biggest purposes of the facility is understanding how climate change and its related impacts alter an aquatic animals ability to perform basic behaviors in its environment said Allison Coffin coprincipal investigator on the grant and neuroscientist in the College of Veterinary Medicine at WSU Vancouver PERIOD

Coffin is currently leading a study in collaboration with the U.S PERIOD Fish and Wildlife Service that will focus on rearing healthier Chinook salmon PERIOD The research will aim to understand how hatchery conditions for Chinook salmon along the Columbia River Gorge impact their ability to orient and swim properly PERIOD

While the facility is based in Pullman some of the equipment  is relatively portable she said PERIOD

During her research Coffin intends on borrowing equipment from the facility PERIOD

Salmon are finicky PERIOD They really like lots of cold water with a ton of oxygen and good water flow she said PERIOD And so we think its going to be easier to temporarily transport a piece of equipment to the Vancouver campus for a few weeks. the facility plans to advertise to other institutions in the Pacific Northwest like the University of Idaho to allow them the opportunity to use the facilitys equipment which would increase usership Crespi said PERIOD

The facility also plans to create a website and have labs available as well PERIOD Labs have already been conducted in the facility with students in comparative physiology and animal development classes she said PERIOD
