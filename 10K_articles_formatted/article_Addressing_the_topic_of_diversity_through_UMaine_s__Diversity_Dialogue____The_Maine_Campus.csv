This past Tuesday Feb PERIOD  The University of Maine hosted a Diversity Dialogue PERIOD This program was an opportunity to openly discuss topics surrounding diversity between the general public UMaine students and staff and guests from the Tree Street Youths program from the LewistonAuburn area PERIOD This event was hosted by the College of Education and Human Development PERIOD

Tree Street Youths is a program that was founded in  and began as a homework help program PERIOD It was designed to help up to  youths at a time with specifically tailored learning opportunities as stated on their webpage PERIOD It works in partnership with the Refugee Assistance Program local AmeriCorps staff and a host of community volunteers PERIOD

The mission of Tree Street Youth is to support the youth of LewistonAuburn through programs rooted in academics the arts and athletics in a safe space that encourages healthy physical social emotional and academic development while building unity across lines of difference. the program has currently served over  students PERIOD The majority of students that attended from Tree Street youths were refugees or asylum seekers from African countries PERIOD

On Nov PERIOD   nine UMaine students and I visited Park Avenue Elementary School and Tree Street Youth John Maddus an associate professor of Education said about the event he helped organize PERIOD We were very much impressed with both places PERIOD That visit gave rise to the idea of a group of staff and students from Tree Street Youth coming to UMaine during February school vacation week which they did for the first time in February  PERIOD The visit on Feb PERIOD   was the fifth annual visit for Tree Street Youth to UMaine. the dialogue saw about  participants and was designed as a round room discussion PERIOD A question was posed and was left for any individual to respond with their thoughts and feelings PERIOD Questions ranged from What do you think of the UMaine campus to How do you feel during this political climate and What does being in the United States mean for or to you It allowed the group to see how individuals whose backgrounds varied dramatically from person to person would respond PERIOD The space created for this discussion was also a safe closed space as attendees were asked to keep the personal information shared during the discussion within the bounds of the group PERIOD

There is an imminent fear of immigrants here in Maine because some of them are from the countries that have been banned by the President and we have a lot of people from here at the University of Maine who truly care and are compassionate about these families here in Maine Silvestre Guzman the director of the Office of Multicultural Student Life said PERIOD They want to learn more about how to help which definitely helped draw people to the dialogue. students and staff alike were very relieved to have the opportunity to speak in this setting especially with the young students of Tree Street Youth PERIOD This event was one of the later in the Black History Month lineup which ends this Tuesday PERIOD Other upcoming events similar to this event include the Wilson Center International Panel Discussion which will take place on March  the graduate Student Discussion on March  and Diversity Week which will be taking place from March  to March  PERIOD All of these events are based on the idea of diversity and similar topics PERIOD
