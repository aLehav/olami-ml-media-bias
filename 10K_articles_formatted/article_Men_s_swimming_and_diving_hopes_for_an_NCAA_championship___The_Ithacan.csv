6793,2023-07-26,"the Ithaca College mens swimming and diving team raised the curtain on its  campaign with three consecutive victories against SUNY Fredonia SUNY Brockport and SUNY Buffalo on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Last year the Blue and Gold compiled a  record in the regular season and earned the bronze medal in the Empire  Conference Championships PERIOD

The Blue and Gold finished the  season with a fourmeet win streak which became a fivemeet win streak when they won their first meet of the season PERIOD The streak ended when the Bombers lost their second meet on Oct PERIOD  to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .. PERIOD

Jake Lichter  who swam breastroke and freestyle for the Blue and Gold from  to  is entering his first season as the South Hill squads assistant coach PERIOD He said the young swimmers are one of the teams anchors this season PERIOD

We have a lot of really young swimmers who are already starting to contribute right off of the bat just in our first meet Lichter said PERIOD We are looking forward to seeing what they can do over the course of this season and the course of their next two seasons. head coach Kevin Markwardt did not respond to multiple requests for comment PERIOD

There are only eight upperclassmen listed on the roster of  swimmers and divers PERIOD

Eight of the underclassmen Andrew Mikhailichenko Nate Bartalo Daniel Meyers Stanley Zaneski Justin Moczynski Liam Maginnis John Mosier and Kevin Shin have finished in the top three in events thus far this year PERIOD

Lichter said the leadership of the upperclassmen despite their small number is integral to the team PERIOD He also said there is a healthy mesh of leadership styles among the upperclassmen with some men being more vocal while others lead by example PERIOD

One of the seven juniors Kellen Scanlan said the different leadership styles of the upperclassman fit the different personalities on the team PERIOD

All of our leaders could be talkers but then we have too many people talking Scanlan said PERIOD I think we have different levels of what people need PERIOD There are those people who migrate to those are would be very vocal  or theres those who maybe back off from that and then look for someone who is working hard just focusing on getting the work and doing it right. there are only  swimmers on this years roster compared to  swimmers last season and  swimmers on the  roster PERIOD

Its a little challenging to make sure that we are filling out a solid lineup when we just have our smaller numbers on the swimming side he said PERIOD On our diving side we actually have more divers than weve had in the last five years PERIOD We combat that with having a little bit more divers. moczynski earned two silvers in the  and 3meter dives for the Bombers against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute PERIOD

However Lichter said there are still some issues with depth PERIOD

We got the topend speed to compete with everybody in our conference he said PERIOD Its just when it comes to our second and third person its becoming a little more challenging to fill in those gaps. lichter said the sophomores and juniors from last season have now taken over the higher spots in the lineups for certain events that were held by last years four seniors thus opening up holes in certain events for second and third stringers PERIOD Last seasons freshman class was quite large so he said trying to find which swimmers and divers can fit into those gaps will be an obstacle this season PERIOD

Also there are a few freshman who do not have a defined event to swim in just yet Lichter said PERIOD

We need to figure out where we are going to put these guys moving forward he said PERIOD Because if we dont figure out what we are going to do with them then were going to be training them for the wrong stuff and not get them as prepared as we want them to. sophomore freestyle swimmer Nate Bartolo said the team is focusing tirelessly on improving everyones endurance PERIOD

This season we are working especially hard on sprinting so we have added an extra morning practice on Tuesday mornings he said PERIOD

Regardless of the fact that the team is quite young and still developing Scanlan said he expects to see positive progress throughout the season PERIOD

I think that is something we saw last year with the freshman he said PERIOD We had a big freshman class once the wheels started going then we started picking it up PERIOD But I think this year we started where we left off PERIOD I think we started with a great first week of practice and I think weve gotten progressively better. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
