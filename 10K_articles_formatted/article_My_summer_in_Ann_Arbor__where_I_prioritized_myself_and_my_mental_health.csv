One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

In the lobby of the School of Kinesiology building my friend and I were reminiscing about our high school days PERIOD We reflected on how college had changed the both of us PERIOD At some point I jokingly brought up one of my college essay drafts in which I described myself as a chill and laidback person PERIOD I had expected a playful remark of some sort or just a nod of acknowledgement PERIOD To my surprise she responded that the Daisey she knew in high school was incredibly uptight obsessed with academics and getting into a good college PERIOD

Weeks later while drinking my frappuccino and brainstorming topics for a Michigan in Color piece I thought about this conversation once again PERIOD I was convinced that what she said wasnt true Im literally such a downtoearth person PERIOD How could she say that My sophomore year roommate studies all the time while I take fivehour naps were all thoughts running through my head PERIOD

However when I really thought about it I realized some truths Before this summer I was obsessed with being a high achiever PERIOD

In the past I always had a sinking feeling when someone answered questions correctly quicker than me PERIOD When I was rejected from a summer internship program I was jealous of others who were able to enjoy its stipends and fellowships PERIOD On top of taking difficult STEM classes every year since I started at the University I was an active member in at least five organizations and also did six hours of research each week PERIOD Yet I felt like I needed to do more as a premed student to set myself apart PERIOD All these complex and negative emotions were tied to the values instilled in me as a child PERIOD

In my memories I return to elementary school where I was constantly competing against another girl in class PERIOD Whenever we got our test scores back one of us would consistently score two percent higher than the other person PERIOD In our computer class we alternated as the fastest typer in our grades every year PERIOD Ultimately I came out on top when we graduated PERIOD The need to be the best was instilled and further perpetuated by my parents who wanted me to excel in comparison to my peers PERIOD My father took it upon himself to teach me the multiplication tables beyond what was required and signed me up for IXL a website dedicated to providing math problem sets PERIOD In middle school I was signed up for ICAE Indus Center for Academic Excellence another program with a focus on competition math PERIOD One car ride home from school my father told me that I needed to be the best to get into HYP Harvard Yale and Princeton or comparative schools mind you I was still in elementary school PERIOD

Therefore it wasnt odd that going to a prestigious college was stuck in my mind through middle and high school PERIOD And that meant aiming to be the best at what I did PERIOD I took the hardest classes alongside the brightest and hardest working peers at my school PERIOD I took a PreCalculus Honors summer course to skip into AP Calculus AB my sophomore year PERIOD When my friend added AP Computer Science into her schedule I did the same even when I lacked the basics PERIOD At some point I wasnt taking these classes because I enjoyed the subject but rather to show that I was better than the average student at my high school PERIOD On the inside I kept convincing myself that if I wasnt doing well at academics and extracurriculars it was all my fault PERIOD I gave up easily and avoided asking for help whenever I ran into obstacles because I believed that was all I was capable of PERIOD I normalized stress and anxiety to the point that I thought everyone felt the same nervousness as I did every day PERIOD

Going into college I held that same mindset PERIOD Despite not being in the Honors program I took one statistics and two organic chemistry honors classes PERIOD When I didnt perform well in those classes I would scour Reddit clearly I was in highpanic mode to see if medical schools would accept my GPA PERIOD During the Fall and Winter semesters I constantly felt overwhelmed with being on the premed track and the insatiable need to succeed over my peers PERIOD Even more so socially I constantly felt alone and had severe FOMO since I chose to dedicate most of my time to improving my chances at medical school PERIOD While my friends played volleyball or attended parties together I was always in the library studying for an exam PERIOD When I scrolled through their social media posts the next morning I often felt left behind and disconnected from my friend group PERIOD

I felt burnt out towards the end of sophomore year in college PERIOD I was close to seeking a therapist or really anyone who I could just talk to about feeling deeply unaccomplished in my academic and personal life PERIOD I refused to believe I had a case of the infamous Imposter Syndrome and I felt very embarrassed talking to my friends whose lives seemed so put together PERIOD I knew that I was breaking down PERIOD Hiding behind my bed at home and crying my eyes out for no reason a week before the start of Winter semester was a sign that I needed help PERIOD

Before summer began I consulted one of my friends about how I was feeling and he suggested that I try opening up to my friends more before going to therapy PERIOD One of my lab partners also talked about her goal of improving herself rather than obsessing over how she compares to her peers PERIOD After these conversations I realized that I could feel better about myself if I put more time into taking care of my mental health and changing my mindset PERIOD I ultimately chose to forgo the therapy option and I decided to spend the summer in Ann Arbor which culminated into a healing journey for me full of many firsts. my decision to forgo therapy was solely my own if you or someone else you know is struggling with mental health please see the bottom of this article for resources. right after classes ended I had a brief period of no obligations since my research position started a few weeks later PERIOD I finally had enough time to sit and reflect under the bright summer sun and put myself and my happiness first PERIOD Because I didnt need to worry about my grades and extracurriculars I reconnected with my old hobbies while exploring new ones PERIOD I started a GoodReads book challenge and binged Korean Dramas PERIOD I decided to join MiC so I could express myself more through writing PERIOD I met with old friends and even professors and GSIs from classes that I really enjoyed  coincidentally the majority were from writing classes PERIOD I also celebrated my birthday with my old friends and new ones I made during the summer PERIOD A week ago was the first time I used a Spin scooter on campus PERIOD The new experiences Ive had in the last two months have allowed me to let go and have fun something that is difficult during the busy and stressful schoolfilled semesters PERIOD

Treating myself and prioritizing my mental health has also improved my academic and social dilemmas PERIOD While I still feel antsy about FOMO especially with the summer Instagram posts I found ways to keep myself busy and make my own company fun PERIOD Instead of checking my phone constantly I now spend more of my time reading and working PERIOD I used to feel guilty about missing out but I learned that I can balance hanging out with friends and enjoying my own time PERIOD Before I only applied for opportunities that looked good for medical school applications but now I focus more on what I enjoy doing PERIOD My mindset has changed from I need to do this to boost my application to Im making a difference in peoples lives as well as my own. now I feel a sense of fulfillment instead of an obligation to check off todo items PERIOD Even though Im still pushing myself I think Im finally heading in the right direction PERIOD

Sometimes we need time to just slow down and reevaluate our goals and feelings PERIOD This year I felt a huge weight lifted off of me when I decided to take the month of May off PERIOD I had the opportunity to rediscover myself and my goals again PERIOD Finally Im joining activities that are important to me and I feel control over my own life PERIOD While I still struggle with finding balance in my life I think asking myself How are you and Do you need a break has helped a lot along with a couple of necessary cry sessions PERIOD I feel more in tune to myself and I am proud of myself even if healing requires taking a step back PERIOD
