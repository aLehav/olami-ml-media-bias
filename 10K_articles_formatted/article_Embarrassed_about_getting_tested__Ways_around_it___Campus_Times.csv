I walked into the suite party entering a world of shirtless girls flailing their halfcovered breasts around to the sounds of Keshas Tik Tok. to my right were guys making out with girls theyd hardly remember the next morning PERIOD

Coming my way was a pretty little brunette girl who in her attempts at welcoming me recklessly spilled half of her beer on my boots and offered me a kiss as a strange form of apology PERIOD Oh the beautiful sights of college I thought PERIOD Theres no experience like it PERIOD

Some of us come to this place called college and find our more daring and sexual sides while others choose not to explore that side of themselves at all PERIOD Some of us take sexual risks to evaporate the loneliness of not having a partner while others do so just to take a chance PERIOD

Many of these choices have eventually proven to be mistakes PERIOD The kind you wake up to the next morning and think How did I get here or Who is this random girl lying in my bed These are the mistakes many of us would consider to be the best PERIOD After all the best mistakes are said to be the ones you dont remember PERIOD But what happens when these mistakes have an aftermath What happens when you begin to develop a nasty sore on your genitals that wasnt there just a week ago

For some sexually active college students it takes moments like these for us to realize that we need to take a visit to University Health Service PERIOD As awkward as these visits may be taking such a little step by going to the doctors office could go a long way PERIOD

On those often dreaded visits to our physicians it is common that we walk out assuming we are diseasefree because we never receive an anonymous letter stating otherwise PERIOD Many times we presume that this is an indication that we have no STD worries PERIOD

Unfortunately this is not the case PERIOD

What we may be surprised to learn is that in most cases these physicians do not automatically perform tests that indicate whether someone is infected or not PERIOD Such services must be requested from the patient PERIOD It would be nice if this was done without having to go through the awkward process of asking your physician to test you for STDs but it just isnt that easy PERIOD

The first and most vital part to ensuring that we dont catch something nasty from our partner would be to use condoms PERIOD Unfortunately in situations where its all about a good time we forget about this option or chose not to take advantage of it PERIOD Once this option is disregarded and the damage has been done our next choice would be to get tested.Asking our physicians to test us for STDs is a huge hurdle that many find tough to get over PERIOD Lets be honest it can be embarrassing and just plain uncomfortable PERIOD

Leaving a note at the front desk of the clinic telling your doctor to test the cup of urineyouve given him or asking the nurse to relay the message to the doctor are both effective ways to avoid the embarrassment PERIOD

Many people choose not to use their primary physician to test them for diseases but instead go to outside clinics that will do it for a cheap fee PERIOD This can make things a little less uncomfortable because once the tests are done you never have to see those people at the clinic again PERIOD Places like Planned Parenthood usually test their patients without being asked to do so so this could be another great way to get around such discomfort PERIOD

Going there will help you avoid having to discuss STDs with your primary doctor who you have to see at least once a year PERIOD

Whatever your method dont let your fear of asking to get tested keep you from being in tune with your sexual health PERIOD
