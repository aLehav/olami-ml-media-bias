Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





A worker at the popular Mad Mushroom Pizza shop has tested positive for the coronavirus the company said in a tweet Sunday PERIOD

The Mad Mushroom employee who claimed to test positive for COVID19 falsified the image of the test result according to owner Dave Sommers PERIOD

The employee created a false document to show a positive test Sommers said Monday afternoon PERIOD

Tippecanoe County Health Department officials had been unable to connect a positive test result connected with the individuals name Sommers said PERIOD

Health Department Administrator Khala Hochstedler said the health department usually receives information on positive cases from the Indiana State Health Department  hours in advance of the official release so it often learns about positive cases before employers PERIOD She said it typically informs restaurants of their employees having positive results not the other way around PERIOD

Details are then usually verified within an hour of contacting employers according to Hochstedler PERIOD

Weve been working with Mad Mushroom since yesterday on the plan Hochstedler said PERIOD Ive been unable to verify a result so theyre allowed to reopen  Theyre cleared to reopen by the health department.This is the first time Ive heard anything like that in our countyor in general. the individual no longer works at Mad Mushroom PERIOD

That employee chose to leave our employ at that time PERIOD  that was supposed to be their last shift with us anyways Sommers said PERIOD But it would have been by my choice at that point. sommers said he will still have a professional sanitizing team thoroughly clean the restaurant but it will reopen on Tuesday PERIOD
