9576,2004-05-25,"in the wake of Vice President for Student Affairs Mary Sias late April departure to assume the presidency at Kentucky State University several Student Life administrators have reorganized job responsibilities to fill her shoes PERIOD

Although students wont see any immediate changes to services offered administrators hope the move will reap rewards in the long run PERIOD

I think the benefit to students ultimately will be a more integrated approach to activities and services said Phyllis Blanck who has been named assistant dean of students in addition to her current role as Student Union director PERIOD

In another reassignment former Associate Dean of Students Donna Rogers has been promoted to interim assistant vice president of student affairs and dean of students to succeed Darrelene Rachavong PERIOD Rachavong was promoted to assume Sias position on an interim basis PERIOD

In her new capacity Rogers is now responsible for academic dishonesty cases PERIOD Blanck will assist her in the handling of these cases PERIOD

The Student Life management team sees the restructuring as an outgrowth of the rapid development the division has undergone in conjunction with the evergrowing enrollment of the university PERIOD

The Student Union has really come into its own in the last couple of years Blanck said PERIOD Theres not a single area of student life that isnt growing and thats very rewarding. patty Atchley Mary Walters and Jay Miller the directors of student development activities and media respectively will now report to Blanck instead of Rogers PERIOD

Rogers said some of the administrative changes were planned before Sias departure but occurred sooner due to the announcement PERIOD

Its part of the natural growth of student life PERIOD I think the changes will really strengthen the Union and programming aspect of student life Rogers said PERIOD

To further foster growth and awareness of Student Life programs the division is making plans to expand its staff this fall to include a marketing position PERIOD

The new staff member will work with The UTD Mercury the Student Union Advisory and Activities Board SUAAB and other student organizations to encourage student participation PERIOD

For years no matter how many ways we get the word to students we hear them say Theres nothing to do on campus. this will be a way to get the message out in a more targeted way Rogers said PERIOD

In its most recent budget deliberations the student fees committee recommended funding for the fulltime professional position beginning Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Upon final approval of the budget the SU administration will advertise during the summer for candidates with backgrounds in both marketing and student life Blanck said PERIOD

We want an enthusiastic creative marketingtype person PERIOD Its not uncommon for unions to have a marketing position Rogers said PERIOD

The proposal for the position put forth by the SU administration began as a discussion to update the existing signage around campus PERIOD

Administrators hope a new marketing position will make better use of the existing modes of event publicity and possibly create new ones PERIOD

We hope they will come up with creative opportunities that either we havent thought of or havent had time to pursue Rogers said PERIOD

The marketing manager will focus solely on student life events within campus PERIOD Rogers said position will not to aid in recruiting or as an extension of the existing News  Information department of the university PERIOD
