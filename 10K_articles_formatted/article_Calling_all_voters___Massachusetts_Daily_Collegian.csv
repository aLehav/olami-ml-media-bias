Have you registered to vote In Amherst These seem to be the only two questions that have fallen on every pair of ears on campus PERIOD Not just once or twice but repeatedly I have been asked by tens of different faces whether or not I have registered to votein Amherst PERIOD As a matter of fact I am registered to vote although in my hometown and not in Amherst PERIOD Im expecting my absentee ballot to come in the mail any day now PERIOD However as I await the arrival of this very important document I cant help but think should I even vote

Before assumptions are made let me explain myself PERIOD Im not one of those people who questions whether or not I should vote because Im unsure if my vote will even count PERIOD I am fully aware that each vote matters PERIOD My hesitation comes from what I currently know about the potential candidateswhich is absolutely nothing PERIOD As an uninformed voter should I vote

As I sat down to write this blog I was completely unsure of where I stood on this issue PERIOD On the one hand I know that voting is one of the most critical responsibilities we have as citizens of this nation PERIOD However if I am unaware on where the candidates stand on important issues I could end up voting for a potential dictator or someone who will reverse all the progress America has made thus far PERIOD

So what exactly is the solution to this to vote or not to vote dilemma I asked around and got a mix of answers ranging from a definite yes or no to responses like how uninformed PERIOD While each individual is entitled to his or her opinion heres the resolution I eventually came to everyone eligible to vote should most definitely without a doubt vote PERIOD Voting is first and foremost a right and it is a right that people fought for years to earn PERIOD Not only did people fight to earn this right but people died over this cause PERIOD It is horrifying to think that something people once fought and died for is now being brushed aside and thought of as more of a chore than a privilege PERIOD

In regard to the issue of being an uninformed voter its simple dont be uniformed PERIOD There is no excuse for not taking  minutes out of your day to go onto your computer and look up some facts about the candidates PERIOD Whether you understand their entire histories or their stance on just one or two issues that you deem to be important anything is better than going into the polls completely clueless PERIOD If the Internet is too much work then find a friend who understands politics have them give you a fivesentence summary on each of the candidates and pick the one that you would rather identify with PERIOD The bottom line is if you are eligible to vote and are uninformed become informed PERIOD Do not waste this opportunity that people fought for you to have make the future better for yourself and those around you PERIOD Votein Amherst or in your hometown PERIOD
