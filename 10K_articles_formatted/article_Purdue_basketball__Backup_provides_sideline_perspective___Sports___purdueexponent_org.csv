Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



















Hes one of the few upperclassmen on the mens basketball team and despite not being a key contributor his voice matters PERIOD

Junior guard Stephen Toyra is a veteran leader who doesnt need playing time to give his voice credibility PERIOD The Lafayette native came to Purdue as a walkon in  giving all the effort a scholarship athlete would PERIOD But his work paid off as Toyra was recently rewarded a scholarship much to the delight of fellow junior guard Rapheal Davis PERIOD

Hes one of the hardestworking guys we have whether its on the court or off the court Davis said PERIOD Ive respected him since I first met him and he deserves his scholarship. toyra doesnt put up points like sophomore guard Kendall Stephens or grab rebounds like junior center A.J PERIOD Hammons and he probably wont play as much as even freshman guard P.J PERIOD Thompson PERIOD Toyra knows hes not the star PERIOD In fact he takes pride in playing a secondary role PERIOD

What Toyra does best is watching the game PERIOD He sits on the bench and pays keen attention to his teammates and their opponents PERIOD Often times he sees things his teammates in the game arent able to recognize PERIOD

A lot of times just like backup quarterbacks bench players can look at things the starter doesnt see Toyra said PERIOD Its the exact same thing in basketball where it might be a point guard or a shooting guard doesnt see how that second or third defender is playing a ball screen PERIOD If youre sitting on the bench you can kind of take all that in and really help. davis was also in a situation similar to Toyras early on in his career PERIOD He played  minutes a game but was able to learn a lot through his time spent watching from the sideline PERIOD He believes players like Toyra can improve their games merely by consuming the game from a different angle PERIOD

I feel like its just like watching film or something Davis said PERIOD Being out there watching and supporting your teammates helps you become a better teammate PERIOD Then when you get thrown into the fire you can jump in and be ready to go. toyra who enjoys counseling his teammates during timeouts and TV commercial breaks says the  mens squad will be much better off because theyre more willing to listen a trait that wasnt as apparent in the team during his first two seasons PERIOD

I wouldnt say it hasnt been there but to the degree that it is this year dwarfs the years in the past Toyra said PERIOD I think it makes it fun because everybody can kind of gather things from everybody elses experiences PERIOD It provides encouragement because everyone is on the same page. he continued saying that this years team will be better off because they listen to guys like himself I think the biggest thing this year is to have players who are looking for advice from guys who are on the bench or from guys who are more experienced. log In
