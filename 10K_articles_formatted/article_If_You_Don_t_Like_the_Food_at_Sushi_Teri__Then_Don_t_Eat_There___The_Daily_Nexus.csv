This is in response to Jon Morins letter Daily Nexus Sushi Teri Stinks Worse Than Any Raw Fish in the World Feb PERIOD   PERIOD Im sorry that you didnt like the food you ordered last week and Im sorry the bag broke which Im sure must have put you in a bad mood PERIOD But dont you think it would be just a tad bit more productive to have called or written to the manager of the restaurant instead of lambasting it for the whole campus to see

It is a little saddening that you would put out such negative PR for a restaurant so new to Isla Vista PERIOD I know for a fact that there are plenty of people who enjoy the food served at Sushi Teri  they have three more locations in Santa Barbara and one in Carpinteria PERIOD I personally have started to recognize people who come in day after day  I just began working there part time mostly because I have been a fan of the food for over a year PERIOD Yesterday I talked to a friend of mine who is abroad in England this year and when I told her I was working there she was very excited that theres now a Sushi Teri within walking distance of where she will be living next year PERIOD We think the food is great PERIOD

A business depends on the satisfaction of its customers if the food is as bad as you claim it wont survive anyway PERIOD But if you so violently discourage others from trying it it will fail sightunseen PERIOD So when you order or buy something anywhere that isnt what you were expecting do the business a favor and tell them PERIOD Help them help you PERIOD
