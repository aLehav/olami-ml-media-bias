9580,2023-04-17,"student Government passed a resolution calling on UTD to divest funds from five weaponmanufacturing companies on April  as a push against militarism and for corporate responsibility PERIOD

S.R PERIOD  or Divestment for Militarism recommends that UTD divest its shares in the University of Texas Investment Management Company or UTIMCO which manages UTDs investments and endowment funds PERIOD The five companies of interest are Raytheon Technologies Lockheed Martin Boeing Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics which provide arms for various countries including the U.S. Saudi Arabia and Israel PERIOD

According to reports from UTIMCOs Permanent University Fund Schedule of Investment UTIMCO invests over . million in companies whose contributions have been used to fund violence against civilians in countries such as the U.S. Mexico Palestine and Yemen PERIOD The resolution calls on UTD to guarantee transparency in future investments and develop a Socially Responsible Investment framework to set a plan for ethical investing PERIOD Copies of S.R PERIOD  are en route to the Texas Board of Regents and the president of UTD PERIOD The resolution was authored by Nidaa Lafi a global business and IMP senator and neuroscience senator Khaled Shihabi who are also a part of the advocacy group Students for Justice in Palestine PERIOD

We view this resolution as step one in a much longer fight to have our university fully divest from the militarism industry more largely Lafi said PERIOD The goal is to get it to the UTIMCO level. lafi said the resolution started as an initiative from SJP and has since received cosponsorship from  student organizations including Deeds Not Words  the largest political organization on campus  the League of Latin American Students Pride  UTD several Greek life groups and the Muslim Student Association to name a few PERIOD A student petition in support of the resolution has gathered over  signatures PERIOD

Historically divestment has been a very powerful tool for political change Lafi said PERIOD We think of apartheid in South Africa and how student organizers across the country in the 80s called on their campus to divest from corporations complicit in or directly facilitating apartheid or engaging in business with them  The reason we targeted these corporations are because of their direct relationship with facilitating war death apartheid and genocide around the world. sJP presented a similar but less structured proposal at an SG senate meeting last spring but it did not make the agenda PERIOD In response Lafi and Shihabi created the Divestment Committee a union of students and organizations committed to strengthening divestment initiatives PERIOD

This campaign was much better than last years Isabella Spartz SG senator resolution cosponsor and finance and economics junior said PERIOD We had a couple of people from the Divestment Committee help but not write the resolution itself PERIOD It was much more clear and in detail compared to last years and we had a lot more people have eyes over it. similar initiatives have been pursued and passed through student governments across the U.S. including at the University of Ohio Columbia University and the University of Houston PERIOD Alex Kerry the UH student who organized his campuses Divest from Death campaign was one of nearly a hundred students that showed up to the April  senate meeting PERIOD

I want to point out two things Kerry said PERIOD UH Divest built a tangible front for collective liberation PERIOD As Palestinian Black Latinx Jewish Asian and more students committed to building a better world UH brought us together in a solidarity that transcends race class and place and affirms that our freedoms are intertwined PERIOD Second Divest created a safe space for marginalized communities on campus  UT Dallas and its organizations have put a strong and powerful campaign which has brought together organizations representing thousands of students. comets had an opportunity to speak either in favor of or against the resolution before SG voted on it PERIOD The majority of students in attendance echoed statements of support with Kerry or told stories of escaping military violence PERIOD

Near the end of the speaking segment a few community members brought up concerns about how the divestment initiative could affect students that support Israel or identify as Jewish PERIOD

Its important that every single student is protected from Palestinian students to Jewish students a Richardson resident said PERIOD I encourage you to take a moment to think about how Jewish students will be impacted and how theyll be ostracized. in response SG made one amendment to the resolution in closed session to further solidify the aim of the resolution which is not a statement against any particular group of people but a statement against militarism in all its forms. the amendment further explained that SG condemns any action taken against any group of people in the name of this resolution PERIOD

I would encourage students to read the resolution in full if they havent already as it seems like any misconceptions can be cleared up by that alone Lafi said PERIOD I want to make it clear that we are opposed to militarism PERIOD This is a resolution against war PERIOD And I think thats something we can all get behind. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
