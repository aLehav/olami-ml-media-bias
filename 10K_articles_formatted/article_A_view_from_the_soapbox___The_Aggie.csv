To anyone who has ever doubted the rationality and humanity of the American political system I give your suspicions credence Prop  PERIOD On Nov PERIOD  California law began enforcing discriminatory marriage practices a second class of citizens was selected for institutionalized prejudice by a slim margin of the electorate PERIOD

Ongoing protests crackle with righteous indignation and indomitable energy against Prop 8s de facto encroachment of the state government into matters of love PERIOD LGBT groups declared last Saturday and Sunday nationwide days of protest and tens of thousands spoke out in San Francisco San Diego Los Angeles Boston Chicago Philadelphia united in the common purpose of restoring equality and providing our gay brothers and sisters with the fundamental right of marriage which we heteros take for granted PERIOD Considering both canons of democracy and morality there is no debate Prop  must be stricken from the state constitution PERIOD

For the gravity Prop  carries the legal verbiage it entails is succinct PERIOD The addition of a single sentence to the California constitution deprives an entire demographic of legal tolerance and deprives us all of a functional democracy Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California. this artless sentence crept onto the ballot as a lastditch holdout for homophobes PERIOD It has successfully overturned a California Supreme Court ruling that tore up Prop  a replica gay marriage ban passed in  PERIOD Although Prop  cut and pasted 22s wording it smeared them onto the constitution thus stripping the judiciary of the ability to overturn it PERIOD Theoretically at least PERIOD

Our constitution must be moderated by all legal bodies to ensure fairness and equality and to represent minority interests PERIOD Balances are foundational to procedural democracy  its the role of the judiciary and of course voters to ensure that the majority not oppress smaller groups by numerical superiority PERIOD Prop  is a cheap shot PERIOD Its just a dipstick reading of are there still less gays than Protestants which enables intolerant agendas to rob minorities of their status as equal American citizens PERIOD

If this is allowed to stand majorities could open the floodgates of regressive petty hatred and vote away black voting rights vote away womens property rights vote away legal protections of communists vote away child custody for vegetarians vote away citizenship of Ron Paul supporters PERIOD Courts ruled marriage to be an inalienable right for all citizens not an inalienable right until we hear otherwise. marriage is as fundamental now as it was in  and as such should be protected PERIOD Concerned groups petitioned the judiciary to remove Prop  from the ballot but courts declined without comment PERIOD Remind them of their jobs PERIOD

Seventytwo percent of Californian voters turned out to vote on Prop  and a . percent majority swayed the vote to yes. a yes to the abuse of democracy PERIOD A yes to perpetuating closedmindedness and social division PERIOD A yes to the validation of puritanical conceit PERIOD A yes to the continued mistreatment of people just people who want the opportunity to find love and companionship in an unsettled lonely world PERIOD

How would the tolerance of love bring hurt to anyone Arguments for a ban on gay marriage are wholesale nonsecular and absurd PERIOD First is the notion that Christian moral scientists cracked the universal code of ethics and saw that gayness will result in fire brimstone festering boils AIGs collapse etc PERIOD I ask of them Where have gone the values of a compassionate Christ Grow up and realize that homosexuality is love and to obsess over the sexual behavior of others may not have been your Gods intention PERIOD Many others are uncertain or uncommitted PERIOD

To them I ask Would you settle for anything less than equal treatment Look past the ephemeral and realize the common humanity we all share PERIOD Arent we past ready for the next step in the journey toward human community See truth PERIOD
