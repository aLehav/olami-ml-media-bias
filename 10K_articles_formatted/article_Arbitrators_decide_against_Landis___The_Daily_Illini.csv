Floyd Landis reacts as he crosses the finish line to win the seventeenth stage of the ninety-third Tour de France in the French Alps on July   PERIOD Landis was found guilty on Thursday of doping during the cycling race PERIOD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ALESSANDRO TROVATI

By EDDIE PELLS  The Associated Press September  

PARIS  The verdict said guilty. like so much else in the confusing contentious Floyd Landis doping case though none of the answers are really that simple PERIOD

Landis lost his expensive and explosive case Thursday when two of three arbitrators upheld the results of a test that showed the  Tour de France champion used synthetic testosterone to fuel his spectacular comeback victory PERIOD

The decision means Landis who repeatedly has denied using performanceenhancing drugs must forfeit his Tour title and is subject to a twoyear ban retroactive to Jan PERIOD   PERIOD

Not that it changes his opinion of who the rightful winner was PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

I am innocent he said and we proved I am innocent. the majority of the panel disagreed PERIOD

According to documents obtained by The Associated Press lead arbitrators Patrice Brunet and Richard McLaren voted to uphold the positive test with Christopher Campbell dissenting PERIOD

In its 84page decision the majority found the initial screening test to measure Landis testosterone levels  the testosteronetoepitestosterone test  was not done according to World AntiDoping Agency rules PERIOD

But the more precise and expensive carbonisotope ratio analysis IRMS performed after a positive TE test is recorded was accurate the arbitrators said meaning an antidoping rule violation is established. as has been held in several cases even where the TE ratio has been held to be unreliable  the IRMS analysis may still be applied the majority wrote PERIOD It has also been held that the IRMS analysis may stand alone as the basis of a positive test PERIOD

Todays ruling is a victory for all clean athletes and everyone who values fair and honest competition U.S PERIOD AntiDoping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said PERIOD

Now Landis is left with one final way to possibly salvage his title  an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport PERIOD

If Landis doesnt appeal  or appeals and loses  hell be the first person in the 105year history of the race to lose the title because of a doping offense PERIOD

Given the vigor with which he pursued the case and the more than  million he raised to do it this goes down as a devastating loss for the 31yearold cyclist from Murietta Calif PERIOD

He has steadfastly insisted that cheating goes against everything he stands for PERIOD He said he was merely a pawn in the antidoping systems allconsuming effort to find cheaters and keep money flowing to its labs and agencies PERIOD

This ruling is a blow to athletes and cyclists everywhere Landis said PERIOD For the Panel to find in favor of USADA when with respect to so many issues USADA did not manage to prove even the most basic parts of their case shows that this system is fundamentally flawed. he is still weighing his legal options according to a statement released by his legal team PERIOD

This is a miscarriage of justice said Maurice Suh the lead attorney for Landis PERIOD

He is at the mercy of people much bigger than him said Landis mother Arlene speaking to WGALTV in Lancaster Pa PERIOD

The decision comes more than a year after Landis stunning comeback in Stage  of the  Tour one that many people said couldnt be done without some kind of outside help PERIOD

Pat McQuaid leader of cyclings ruling body said rules dictate that Landis can be stripped of his Tour de France title immediately PERIOD That makes Oscar Pereiro who finished second last year the official winner PERIOD

Its not a great surprise considering how events have evolved McQuaid said PERIOD He got a highly qualified legal team who tried to baffle everybody with science and public relations PERIOD And in the end the facts stood up. landis insisted on a public hearing not only to prove his innocence but to provide an unflinching look at USADA and the rules it enforces and also establish a pattern of incompetence at the French lab where his urine was tested PERIOD

The decision comes a full  months after Landis final sprint down the ChampsElysees which was bustling with businessmen and shoppers Thursday not bicyclists and spectators PERIOD

We waited too long Tour de France race director Christian Prudhomme said PERIOD But it is an ending as we expected PERIOD Its over and we never had any doubts.",Arbitrators decide against Landis - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
