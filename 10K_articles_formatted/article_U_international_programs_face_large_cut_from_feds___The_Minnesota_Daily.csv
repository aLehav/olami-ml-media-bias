5062,2023-11-04,"officials say a proposed  percent cut to Title VI grants would hurt four University programs PERIOD

by  Jill JensenPublished  May  

Mohamed Dirie grew up speaking Somali but he was not able to read or write it until the University of Minnesota started an intermediatelevel language course in fall  PERIOD
It made me believe that the Somali language was important Dirie said PERIOD
With the growing Somali population in Minnesota Dirie said its critical that the University continues to offer the language classes which are completely funded by a federal grant through Title VI of the Higher Education Act PERIOD But this funding could be in jeopardy if Congress passes cuts to them next year PERIOD
Facing pressure to balance the federal budget the U.S PERIOD House Appropriations Committee recommended slashing  percent of Title VI funding which gives fouryear grants to four international programs at the University the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition the Institute for Global Studies the European Studies Consortium and the Center for International Business Education and Research PERIOD
After the House approved its  budget plan in principle April  Rep PERIOD Paul Ryan RWis. the chairman of the House Budget Committee said budget cuts across the board were essential PERIOD
The spending spree is over Ryan said PERIOD We cannot keep spending money we dont have. but program directors at the University are crossing their fingers the cut doesnt come because of the impact they see these international programs have on the University the state and the region PERIOD
Evelyn Davidheiser the director of the Institute for Global Studies said if funds are cut the Institute would probably have to stop developing curriculum teaching some languages at the advanced levels and contributing resources to libraries and to courses in less commonly taught languages PERIOD
She estimates Title VI grants account for  percent of her budget PERIOD
Although the Institute and the European Studies Consortium both have a fouryear grant through August  Davidheiser said funding for the two could be dramatically less next year because the cut would reduce the size of current grants PERIOD
She said without that funding the University would likely withdraw its support as well PERIOD
The impact of the Institute and the Consortium may seem subtle she said but their programs affect more than the  University students who enroll in the less commonly taught language courses  everything but Spanish French and German  every year PERIOD They also provide more than  each year to undergraduate and graduate students as fellowships PERIOD
The Institute for Global Studies has been able to start courses in languages like Swahili and Somali which Davidheiser said would probably not exist without the outside funding provided by Title VI PERIOD
I think the real hit would be support for these language programs Davidheiser said PERIOD
Cuts to these programs would affect more than just University endeavors PERIOD The total impact of the Institute and Consortium is hard to gauge said Laura Seifert coordinator of the Consortium PERIOD
Davidheiser said there is a multiplier effect. for example the Institute hosts outreach programs for K12 teachers who bring that knowledge back to their students PERIOD
Other programs would see cuts to similar activities PERIOD
The Center for International Business Education and Research began in  to help U.S PERIOD businesses compete on a global scale PERIOD
Managing director Abby Pinto said a significant cut would reduce the ability to fund scholarships for University students as well as to develop and run study abroad programs PERIOD It would also limit outreach to businesses and K12 and higher education schools in the region PERIOD
We really rely on and build partnerships within the University and with organizations outside the University to deliver our programming Pinto said so we are able to have much bigger impact from our dollars because we can leverage those partnerships. for the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition director Elaine Tarone said the proposed cut would negatively affect twothirds of its programs PERIOD
CARLA focuses on improving the quality of teaching languages she said by supporting language immersion projects which deliver regular curriculum in a certain language and are popping up like mushrooms in Minnesota PERIOD
In addition to paying for the staff that assesses and trains language teachers Tarone said they also maintain a free searchable database on where when and who teaches less common languages which she said the federal government uses PERIOD
CARLA supports areas where the University doesnt have enough students or resources and in areas that are critical to our nations survival in this coming century Tarone said PERIOD Thats the beauty of this program  We need people with high levels of linguistic and cultural competence. its unclear how likely it is for the cuts to pass but program directors expect to know the outcome in the next couple weeks PERIOD
