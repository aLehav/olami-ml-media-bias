Senior Katie Rainsberger competes in the Womens  meter run during the Husky Classic on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD Rainsbergerran a time of  minutes and . seconds in the womens steeplechase at the NCAA Outdoor Championships and is seeded fourthheading into the finals on Saturday June  PERIOD

The first two years of senior Katie Rainsbergers college career was spent running for Oregon PERIOD

Now once again running in Eugene Oregon Rainsberger was looking to leave her mark in the city where it all began only this time she was running at the NCAA Outdoor Championships and was sporting Washington across her chest PERIOD

Running in the  meter steeplechase semifinal Rainsberger definitely left her mark PERIOD With the top five runners in each heat qualifying for the finals Rainsberger left little doubt that she wouldnt be running the steeplechase again Saturday PERIOD

Rainsberger ran a time of  minutes and . seconds and finished second in her heat automatically qualifying for the finals on Saturday June twelfth at  p.m PERIOD Overall the senior finished with the fourth fastest time on the day PERIOD

Rainsbergers time was also a new PR and with her already holding the  meter steeplechase record at Washington the Colorado Springs Colorado native has simply been in a league all by herself when it comes to Washington steeplechase athletes PERIOD

Another Washington distance runner who was looking to have herself a day was Haley Herberg running in the  meter final PERIOD

Throughout the majority of the race Herberg was within striking distance of the leader hanging out in fifth place and then at times she would make a move up to third place and then fall back to fifth or sixth PERIOD

With about seven laps to go however the runners began to separate with two runners clearly creating a gap between them and the field making it no longer a race for first but a race for third for Herberg PERIOD

In the end the senior was unable to have that final burst and finished in fifth with a time of  minutes and . seconds PERIOD Herberg was only . seconds behind the third place finisher PERIOD

Herbergs time was a PR and also earned the Washington womens team their first four points at the  NCAA Outdoor Championships PERIOD

Washington will be sending out more athletes tomorrow with the first athlete competing being Ida Eikeng and Lyndsey Lopes as the heptathlon gets underway at  p.m PERIOD with the  meter hurdles PERIOD

Junior Madison Heisterman finished in seventh in her heat and nineteenth overall at the  meter with a time of  minutes and . seconds PERIOD

Senior Darhian Mills finished at the bottom of the  meter hurdles running a time of  minute and . seconds PERIOD
