OCC students clean up the beaches at Newport Pier on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

An Orange Coast College theatre instructor gave out extra credit as an incentive for her students to clean up the beaches at the thirty-eighth annual California Coastal Cleanup Day on Sept PERIOD  at any of the designated cleanup spots PERIOD

Cynthia Corley a theatre instructor gave out extra credit for her students to join in on Coastal Cleanup Day and clean beaches as an effort to promote the event PERIOD

My inbox this morning had lots of pictures of smiling students holding bags of trash at the beach Corley said PERIOD Even when you get your rubber boots stuck in the mud so badly they get sucked right off your feet its weirdly satisfying icky fun

At first I was just cleaning for the extra credit a student from Corleys class Ashkan NooriEsfandiari said I could have ended early but I ended up with a full bag of trash. along with Corley Theatre Department Chair Tom Bruno also joined in on the action on Saturday to clean up the coast PERIOD

I participate in order to help our environment and the health of our planet and the creatures we share it with Bruno said PERIOD

Both Corley and Bruno had taken part in cleaning up the coast and had been using their class as one of many platforms to promote these activities PERIOD In years past the Theatre Department has promoted the event more heavily and a group of students met me out there in the Back Bay Bruno said PERIOD

They think OCC could do more to promote the day PERIOD Maybe we could make it a part of social media awareness and promote it on the website and in the CoasttoCoast newsletter for next year or get some of the clubs to go Corley said PERIOD

Its a good idea for the school to promote activities like these NooriEsfandiari said PERIOD
