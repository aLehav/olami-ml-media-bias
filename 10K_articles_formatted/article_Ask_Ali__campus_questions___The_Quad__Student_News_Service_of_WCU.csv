9839,2023-11-05,"west Chester University is a campus that provides an innumerable amount of things for its students PERIOD There are lots of places to eat tons of options for residence and a seemingly unlimited amount of organizations ranging from sports to academic clubs PERIOD

Aside from that we are also very fortunate as West Chester students to have a wonderful array of resources at our fingertips PERIOD Not everyone knows exactly how much we have access to here on our campus PERIOD

At the Association for Womens Empowerment meeting on Monday Oct PERIOD  the group was asked what questions they as women had about our school PERIOD

Of the questions received almost all of them had to do with the resources that are offered to us by our school PERIOD It is important that those questions are answered so that we all know what we have accessible to us and how to go about utilizing those sources PERIOD

Q  Who can I talk to if an incident involving sexual harassment occurs Are there options to speak out about it anonymously

If you or someone that you know has experienced sexual assault there are several on and off campus sources that are waiting to help PERIOD If one chooses to report it anonymously they can do so by visiting the Counseling Center on campus PERIOD Sexual assaults can also be reported to the Student Health Center however they are only anonymous if the reporter is over the age of  PERIOD

Offcampus resources include the Crime Victims Center of Chester County which is located at  W PERIOD Market St. and is open from 9am5pm on weekdays as well as The Domestic Violence Center of Chester County which can be found at  Lincoln Hwy E PERIOD

If none of those options feel comfortable one may also seek out ones Resident Assistant a campus Title IX coordinator or a trusted professor who will be able to sit down and go over options PERIOD These people however may be mandated reporters therefore not being anonymous PERIOD

When one chooses to report a sexual assault it does not mean that they are automatically submitting themselves to any formal process PERIOD Reporting simply means that you are allowing yourself to be contacted by someone to go over all of your options which include counseling medical aid legal action etc. without anything being forced PERIOD

Q  Who can I talk to when I am feeling depressed

Whenever anyone feels concerned about the state of their mental health depression included it is a good idea to visit the Counseling Center oncampus PERIOD Without a previouslyscheduled appointment one can walk right in and be seen by any of the trained psychiatrists that the Center has ready on staff PERIOD

Through the Counseling Center students can also get in contact with a counselor by filling out and submitting a survey online at wcu.caresforyou.org PERIOD After reviewing the survey a counselor will then respond with any followup recommendations PERIOD Students may continue communicating with the counselor anonymously or schedule a meeting facetoface PERIOD

If one is struggling with mental health Resident Assistants and trusted administrators oncampus are also willing to help but may not be confidential PERIOD

Q  Are there any volunteer opportunities oncampus regarding womens issues such as domestic violence sexual assault etc

There are plenty of organizations on and off campus that are always looking for volunteers to help PERIOD The Domestic Violence Center of Chester County is currently looking for people to help with a hotline service to talk to people in crisis PERIOD

Additionally offcampus the Planned Parenthood in town may be able to provide volunteer opportunities to those who want to help PERIOD

On campus there are organizations such as the Association for Womens Empowerment which meets weekly to discuss womens issues and promote opportunities to get involved on campus with programs such as Its On Us which puts on a weeklong event to honor and support survivors of sexual assault PERIOD
