6207,2023-10-08,"i want to learn how to use my money better PERIOD What are some of your own strategies or philosophies Thanks  Anonymous

I never thought a day would come when someone asks me for financial advice PERIOD Let me tell you straight up I have no idea why waiters ask to toss your salad PERIOD Perhaps its a ranchy and raunchy pickup line PERIOD I also hope that anything I say will not be used to save a sinking ship on the cusp of capital crisis  unless surprise its a batterypowered submarine PERIOD What Im trying to say is that Taurus and Virgo do not appear in my chart and my Capricorn is only represented in the generational signs PERIOD

Theoretically if you want to save money then dont spend it PERIOD Unfortunately that is just about one of the most impossible feats of the universe as simple luxuries such as coffee  yes coffee is a luxury and you are not entitled to caffeination fueled by labor exploitation  with its creme creme au balsamic vinegar espresso are sinkholes for the green PERIOD And unless youre planting an oak tree you dont want to do the daily devils deed in the pit of sin Find out what you dont need in your life and cut it out PERIOD It is very telling if youre not just dependent on liquid beans but you also begin to glorify the sounds of the steamy exhaust from the coffee press and how the coffee shop is your life PERIOD An occasional cup of caffeine is fine but you can survive without it PERIOD

Conversely money as an institution is made to be spent and exercised PERIOD And under the neoliberal model it also is something to be hoarded so it never circulates back into the economy thus destroying any semblance of trickledown economics and creating a polarizing disparity between the upper and working classes PERIOD Im sure youre aware of this from your classes and are either hyper aware snapping your fingers or choosing to ignore this reality and rolling your eyes in apathy PERIOD Well whoever you are you shouldnt be afraid to spend money whether thats on your apartment rent groceries Netflix or a book  one that you actually want to read PERIOD Be confident in whatever you invest it in and know that paying bills while groanworthy enables you to have shelter and groceries to eat PERIOD Dont forget that having money gives you the privilege to do these things that others might not so appreciate and own it PERIOD
