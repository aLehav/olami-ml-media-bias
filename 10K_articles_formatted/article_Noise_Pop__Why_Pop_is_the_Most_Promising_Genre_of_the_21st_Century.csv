5316,2012-10-08,"the contemporary music scene is the worlds truest democracy PERIOD Together we created Justin Bieber  lets not forget that his debut was a YouTube video uploaded by his mother and the denizens of the internet preteen girls and skeptics alike catapulted him into international stardom PERIOD

This type of crowdsourced AR is extremely empowering PERIOD The question is will we use this for good or for evil
To the dismay ofhipsters everywhere pop audiences are showing a taste for all things alternative PERIOD Neon Trees currently has a song on the Billboard Pop Charts PERIOD So does fun. alex Clare and PSY PERIOD And perhaps more tellingly pop stars are responding to this appetite PERIOD Think Britney Spears dubstepsprinkled album. todays pop stars have to be weary of their newly worldly and opinionated listeners PERIOD The greatest cautionary tale is Lady Gagas sophomore album PERIOD Oblivious to  or disdainful of the growth of Electronic Dance Music EDM in the early aughts Gaga released an album that essentially stylized glam rock PERIOD Everyone bought Born This Way for  cents and promptly forgot about it PERIOD
The inattentive listener will claim that the publics desire for dance music and good times spurs the mediocrity of a lot of pop music but the relationship between pop and dance is hardly a new phenomenon PERIOD People have been dancing to pop since back when that meant waltzing to Schubert predictably lots of his contemporaries hated on him PERIOD
It boils down to the fact that listeners have genrespecific aesthetic expectations punk rock calls for authenticity funk calls for bass lines PERIOD But pop maybe due to the sheer expansiveness of the genre is harder to pinpoint.Cecil Frena of Born Gold provides some interesting perspective on the process of creating pop music Making pop music requires this particular kind of confidence that is fascinating to me  it takes an almost irresponsible selfassurance for a selfaware person to be able to vocalize ba da ba or stick to a conventional song structure or whatever. pop stars begin their careers with little credibility but lots of cultural capital PERIOD They cant expect to be coddled like Pitchforks handpicked treasures PERIOD They cant afford pretension PERIOD Their songs have to be big infectious catchy PERIOD This ba da ba attitude leads to the Black Eyed Peas lobotomized Boom Boom Pow but also drives the unpretentious genius of Stevie Wonders Livin For The City. pop artists can be smart and introspective but they always must have their audience in mind an added challenge that real musicians dont have to worry about PERIOD There are plenty of talented pop stars today that are doing just this PERIOD Robyn has specialized in heartbreak electropop channeling romantic disappointments onto the dance floor with hits like Call Your Girlfriend or Dancing On My Own. adeles sincerity turned the meditative  into a bestseller and Beyonces lovestruck  is full of eargasms PERIOD
John Seabrook of theNew Yorkerasks in a piece about Rihannas songwriting team How did mainstream rock once the source of the catchiest hooks in popular music become robotic unimaginative and predictable while pop always the soul of artifice came to seem creative experimental and alive
Pop triumphed precisely because it is the soul of artifice PERIOD Its unassuming selfaware full of promises eager to please  our music democracys most honest politician PERIOD
