Fencing has always run in the family for Notre Dame graduate student Amanda Sirico PERIOD

My parents met during RecSports fencing at the University of Texas at El Paso Sirico said PERIOD My dad actually recruited my mom to the fencing team PERIOD My younger siblings both fence and Ive been fencing basically since I could walk. the longstanding fencing tradition in Siricos family made itself evident throughout her Notre Dame career and in her final season with the Irish she was named The Observers Notre Dame Female Athlete of the Year PERIOD

Notre Dames prestigious fencing program was a big reason for Siricos college choice as the Irish have claimed six national championships since the mens and womens titles were combined in  PERIOD

I was looking at Ohio State and Notre Dame but I ended up only applying to Notre Dame because I loved the campus so much Sirico said PERIOD It became my first choice pretty quickly. although her last season with Notre Dame was a tough one as Sirico a threetime topthree finisher at the NCAA Tournaments battled several injuries including surgeries on both her arms in the past year to accumulate a  record with the epee one of the three swords used in collegiate fencing PERIOD Sirico put up several strong performances but her experience and leadership of this young team was invaluable for the Irish who finished No PERIOD  in the shortened season PERIOD

Although the COVID19 pandemic prevented Notre Dame from seeking a third national title in four years Sirico despite her injuries qualified for the NCAAs for a fourth straight season PERIOD Despite having competed with Team USA Sirico said she prefers the intensity of the collegiate atmosphere PERIOD

NCAA fencing is so crazy and its really hard because you fight all year and then it comes down to just two days of competing PERIOD Its really intense and theres not much room for failure PERIOD  Youre an individual on a team so youre fencing for yourself and for your team. this year fencing for her team took on a new meaning with the injuries that plagued her fourth and final campaign with the Irish PERIOD As a captain Sirico dealt with the challenges of leading a very young but talented team PERIOD

Being a leader you think its going to be so fun and youre in charge and then you realize Oh Im in charge she said PERIOD Its hard to get them to learn what youve learned by experience PERIOD A lot of them hadnt experienced failure PERIOD Being a leader is fun but hard PERIOD Its a lot of responsibility. with national titles in  and  Notre Dame certainly hadnt experienced a lot of failure and while they managed to stay among the elite teams in the  they had to battle for their spot PERIOD Sirico went  at the Elite Invitational in November leading the womens squad to a  score PERIOD She went  in tough wins over Cornell and Penn proving to be invaluable to her team even when she wasnt operating at  health PERIOD

The Irish women went just  at both the St PERIOD Johns and Philadelphia Invitationals PERIOD The margin for error was thinner than usual but Sirico stepped up frequently late in the season PERIOD The Irish absolutely dominated ACC play sweeping the DeCicco Northwestern and Duke Duals PERIOD The DeCicco Duals are Notre Dames home meet and although injuries prevented Sirico from competing this year fencing on campus has always been enjoyable for the Irish captain PERIOD

Its a ton of fun PERIOD I feel like we sell the fencing team well PERIOD We get to engage with the student body and get to show them our sport especially because its a more niche sport PERIOD Not only is the commute nice the community is really nice Sirico said of the environment surrounding their home tournament PERIOD

Despite being unable to compete in the  DeCicco Duals Sirico has a good history with the tournament as she won the clinching point for Notre Dame in a  victory over Northwestern in her sophomore year PERIOD Thankfully for Sirico she would get another chance to compete on campus as Notre Dame hosted the ACC Championships PERIOD As the Irish bulldozed their way to a title Sirico didnt compete for individual honors but she stepped in for a matchup against Duke gutting out a big win for the Irish to contribute to their team title PERIOD

She then was able to compete individually at the Midwest Regional Championships PERIOD Since going  at the Elite Invitational Sirico had only competed in two bouts and with an  record on the year rust would have been understandable even expected out of Notre Dames captain PERIOD However she put together an admirable performance going  to finish fourth and receive an atlarge bid to the NCAAs which were cancelled PERIOD

That put an impressive cap on a stellar career for Sirico who finished third third and second in three NCAA Tournament appearances and she appeared to be primed to rally and challenge for another top finish at the NCAAs this season PERIOD

After Notre Dames string of two straight national titles was broken in the spring of  Sirico had the Irish firmly back in the conversation with several underclassmen having breakthrough performances PERIOD One fellow epeeist Miriam Grady who fell short to Sirico in last seasons Midwest Regionals won the ACC Championships and Midwest Regionals in  posting a  wins  more than her freshman season PERIOD As a team Notre Dame qualified the maximum  fencers for the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

These past two years Ive dealt with a lot of injuries so I ended up having to take this year off from the national team Sirico said But it was really cool to focus on this team and the NCAAs PERIOD Its sad we didnt get to compete for championships but it was a great season. sirico will be heading to the Wake Forest University School of Business where she will work towards attaining her Masters in Science PERIOD
