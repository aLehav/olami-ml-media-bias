Joe Wieskamp is back to his usual way of getting buckets and it could not have come at a better time for Iowa PERIOD

Behind Wieskamps 16point 7rebound 5steal performance the Hawkeyes toppled No PERIOD  Michigan in CarverHawkeye on Feb PERIOD  for its first signature win of the season  PERIOD

In Iowas previous two games  losses to Minnesota and Michigan State  Wieskamp managed to score only  points on 2of8 shooting PERIOD

Iowa needed Wieskamp to bounce back with a solid game if it wanted to score its first home win over a top10 team since  and thats exactly what the Hawkeyes got PERIOD

Personally I needed this a lot Wieskamp said PERIOD I wouldnt say my confidence was going down but anytime you have two nights where you dont score the ball very well PERIOD Myself Ive always been a big scorer so thats very unlike me. to make the freshmans outing even more impressive it came against one of the countrys best defenses PERIOD

Michigan entered the game giving up only . points per game good for first in the Big Ten and second in the country PERIOD

But on Feb PERIOD  Wieskamp had the Maize and Blue puzzle solved PERIOD

Im so proud of him forward Luka Garza said PERIOD To have two games where hes not scoring as much and come back out here thats when hes showing signs of maturity PERIOD That kids amazing and I was just really happy for him and I knew it would happen  Hes built for these moments. wieskamps scoring started about midway through the first half PERIOD He ripped off a steal at half court and took it back for an easy layup in transition before hitting another easy bucket for Iowas next points PERIOD He made it  in a row with a dunk shortly after PERIOD

After two Nicholas Baer free throws Wieskamp finished with a massive and1 in the midst of a  run for the Hawkeyes in a stretch of  PERIOD

Its still early but we might be watching the JWieskamp21 Game. the freshman has been  in the first half for IowaHoops PERIOD pic.twitter.comZ7w0QgP0GN

He finished the half with  points  more than his previous two games combined  before raising that mark to  by the games end and it was apparent how much it meant to him PERIOD

I struggled a little bit the past few games offensively I didnt get really anything going Wieskamp said PERIOD For myself to get that little run you could see I was showing a little bit of emotion PERIOD I think thats just because everything was all built up the frustration and it just felt good to let it out. wieskamp struggled in Iowas previous matchups with top10 opponents PERIOD

He scored  on 2of5 shooting in the Hawkeyes first loss to thenNo PERIOD  Michigan State on Dec PERIOD  then dropped just  against the No PERIOD  Spartans on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Against No PERIOD  Michigan though it was a different story PERIOD

I told him after the last game I said You got to recognize when you walk on the floor you got to view yourself as one of the best players out there I wouldnt trade you for anybody  Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery said PERIOD You make a mistake run back guard your man PERIOD Im not going to yank you  Develop that swag that you need to be one of the premier players in this league and ultimately in the country PERIOD Thats what he is. email emailprotected
