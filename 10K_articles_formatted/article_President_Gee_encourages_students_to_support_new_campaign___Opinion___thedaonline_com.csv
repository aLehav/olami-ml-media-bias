When you hear the word brand you might think of Apple PERIOD Or Google PERIOD Or the Nike swoosh PERIOD You may even think of one of the most recognizable logos in college sports  the spectacular Flying WV. but a brand is more than a logo tagline or marketing campaign PERIOD

It is who we are and what we represent PERIOD It is a promise by which we live PERIOD

This month West Virginia University is launching a new branding initiative and creative campaign Mountaineers Go First. before returning to this University in  I already knew what awaited me PERIOD West Virginia University had long been established as West Virginias flagship landgrant research institution nestled within a mountainous wonderland of warm friendly faces PERIOD But never mistake that kindness for weakness PERIOD Mountaineers wield a rugged determination  whether inside the labs and classrooms for academic discovery or on the playing fields for sports supremacy PERIOD

As a community our brand represents the total experience of who we are the essence of our institution and the personality we convey PERIOD

As individuals we also bear our own distinctive personal brands PERIOD When you think of me you think of bowties argyle socks selfies fancy eyeglasses and quirkiness PERIOD That is my personal brand PERIOD It has followed me for much of my life PERIOD

This is why brands are important PERIOD It is about staying true to yourself and your own unique characteristics PERIOD

With this new branding effort we want to capitalize on our strengths and build upon that identity PERIOD With many wonderful discoveries and activities taking place at West Virginia University it is time to be a little less humble and a lot more confident  without being arrogant PERIOD It is time to show the world what it means to be a Mountaineer PERIOD

Therefore to bring our brand to life we have launched the creative campaign Mountaineers Go First. you may not know this but part of our identity is shaped by firsts PERIOD Several decades ago before ecofriendly was cool we built the Personal Rapid Transit system or PRT PERIOD It is the first and only electricpowered transportation system of its kind in the world PERIOD

In  alumnus Rouzbeh YassiniFard helped develop the first highspeed communications modems we use today PERIOD In  WVU center Georgeann Wells was the first female basketball player to dunk in an NCAA game PERIOD

And more recently West Virginia University was the first to be an academic partner with the FBI on a Biometrics Center for Excellence PERIOD

Our history is filled with firsts  and we have a world of firsts yet to uncover PERIOD

As we redefine our institution in the marketplace think about your own personal brand PERIOD Then think about the significance you have on the brand of West Virginia University PERIOD

Each of us is an example of what it means to be a Mountaineer PERIOD We personify our Universitys brand every day PERIOD Be bold PERIOD Be confident PERIOD Be innovative PERIOD And let us never forget When everyone else goes back Mountaineers Go First PERIOD

Lets go PERIOD
