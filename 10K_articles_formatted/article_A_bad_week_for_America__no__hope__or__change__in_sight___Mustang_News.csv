This past week has been historic for all the right and wrong reasons PERIOD  A  billion economic bailout has been passed but appears to be a bandaid on a gushing carotid artery the markets set records for how far they could plunge in a day the vice presidential nominees went toe to toe and Arnold asked the Feds for a loan to cover state expenses PERIOD

Is the sky falling  No really is it falling  I cant really tell because Im in my self sustaining bunker PERIOD

Its the economy stupid

I just saved a bunch of money PERIOD by screwing over the American people. this should be the slogan for the recent economic bailout PERIOD  It is a flawed deal and we are regretting it already PERIOD

Many have asked how we got to where we are PERIOD  Frankly I am getting tired of hearing who is to blame for the current mess PERIOD  I dont care if it was the Republicans pushing for less regulation or Clinton passing reforms PERIOD  The bottom line is that our compassion got the better of us in the welfare state we now live in PERIOD  Fanny and Freddie made bad loans PERIOD When the applicant cant pay for a loan it shouldnt be issued PERIOD But the mortgage companies knew the Feds would bail them out taking risk out of the equation PERIOD

As companies invested in the bad loans they spread the problem worse than a hooker on a three day bender PERIOD  And because these loans have been sold in millions of little pieces there is no way of tracking down where the separation is between good and bad loans PERIOD In turn the American people have been left holding the bag of steaming diapers PERIOD I just hope we just dont have to bend over and ask please sir may I have another

Hope and change  empty rhetoric

This week Sen PERIOD McCain promised to take the gloves off when dealing with to Sen PERIOD Obama PERIOD I welcome this change its about time PERIOD

For too long Obamas extended campaign  the media  has hidden or omitted the truth about him PERIOD  What is that truth

For one one of Obamas economic advisers is Franklin Raines former CEO of Fannie Mae PERIOD  During his tenure at Fannie he collected millions from bonuses and early retirement PERIOD

Obama also has ties to William Ayres a terrorist PERIOD Ayers was involved in terrorist bombings of the New York City police headquarters the U.S PERIOD capitol building and the Pentagon in the early 1970s PERIOD When Obama was running for Illinois state senate Ayers donated money to Obamas campaign and hosted a event for him PERIOD

In a fundraiser in San Francisco in April Obama said They get bitter they cling to guns or religion in reference to the frustration of the political process by small town Americans PERIOD  Yet this is the same man who champions his support of the common man PERIOD

These are among the many issues that raise questions to me about Obamas hope and change rhetoric PERIOD Is Obama actually capable of what he claims  Or is he really just a good speaker who makes people feel good  I contend the latter is the case PERIOD  Obamas leadership is nonexistent PERIOD  During his time in the Illinois state senate he took no stances on the big issues PERIOD Rather than voting yes or no on an issue he voted present. how is this leadership

On Sarah Palin

Stephanie Englands guest column in the Mustang Daily on Oct PERIOD  continues to illustrate the genius in Palins nomination PERIOD She has energized the conservative base  something McCain failed to do in the primary season PERIOD   She is a downtoearth sensible person and someone almost anyone can relate to PERIOD She is actually in the middle class something neither Obama Biden or McCain can claim PERIOD

Englands column purported to analyze the vice presidential debates but went wrong in the analysis PERIOD

Does it matter that Palin is casual  Not really PERIOD Frankly if anything it is refreshing PERIOD  You dont honestly believe that she would be as casual to world leaders as she is in a televised debate do you England you say you are tired of the closedminded theocratic elitist politicians but you fail to realize is that you are supporting two of them in your support of Obama PERIOD Neither Obama nor Biden work for consensus both are members of the Washington elite and Obama spent years in a radical theocratic church PERIOD

I frequently disagree with McCain and his policies PERIOD  However out of our options McCain is the most openminded choice we have PERIOD  In May I contended that I was a man without a party or a candidate with the nomination of John McCain PERIOD  I argued that unless something changed I would not vote for president PERIOD

Now many things have changed PERIOD  McCain grew a conservative backbone and chose a conservative running mate PERIOD If Obama wins Id rather douse myself in gasoline then see this shining beacon on a hill plowed under PERIOD

With that said it is good to be back writing for the Daily PERIOD  With everything that is happening Im was almost at a loss as to where to start things off this year PERIOD  There are many issues pressing that should to be presented before the election if only time permitted PERIOD  I hope to cover as many as possible PERIOD
