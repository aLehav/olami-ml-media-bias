If youre new to the world of NASCAR then you may have heard the name Kevin Harvick mentioned quite a bit throughout  PERIOD Even if you dont follow NASCAR you probably heard his name mentioned on Sports Center at least once PERIOD You may have even seen one of his commercials where a miniature version of the 44yearold convinces a shopper to purchase Mobil  motor oil PERIOD

Its been hard to avoid discussion of Kevin Harvick in  and there is a good reason for that PERIOD The driver of the  Busch Beer Ford Mustang for StewartHaas Racing is on a whole different level compared to the rest of the NASCAR Cup Series field PERIOD And were barely halfway through the season PERIOD

Harvicks results this season have been simply incredible PERIOD The 20year NASCAR veteran has won six times already eclipsing his win total from last year PERIOD His  top five finishes tie the same number from last year which he accumulated over the course of a full 36race season PERIOD With  top ten finishes on the year Harvick is on pace to at least tie or break his previous record of  set in  PERIOD The  laps that hes led is just above his season total from last year and he has led the NASCAR Cup Series points standings for  of the  races taking the lead on March eighth and never looking back PERIOD

But what truly sets Harvick apart from the rest of the competition this season is his average finish a metric that often is the determining factor in crowning the seasons champion PERIOD Through  races Harvicks average finish is a staggering . pERIOD His previous best was a . which he achieved in  PERIOD The next best average finish is a . held by Harvicks main competition for the Cup series title Denny Hamlin PERIOD And while Harvicks average finish may drop as the season concludes as the occasional finish outside the top10 can occur to anyone he is still en route to a new personal best PERIOD

With three races left in NASCARs regular season Harvick sits  points clear of secondplace Denny Hamlin PERIOD He is all but guaranteed to win the regular season championship and hes the unequivocal favorite to take the full season title PERIOD The only way he could blow this is a collapse in the upcoming NASCAR playoffs PERIOD

However there is a disturbing precedent for that PERIOD

Harvick has been in NASCARs top division for  years PERIOD He has won  races during NASCAR Cup Series which ties him with NASCAR Hall of Fame member Rusty Wallace for tenth alltime PERIOD Yet he only has a single championship to his credit PERIOD When it comes to NASCARs yearend trophy Harvick has struggled to claim the prize PERIOD His only title came in  and while he has come agonizingly close in the years since he still only has the one championship trophy to his name PERIOD

When I say agonizingly close I mean it PERIOD Harvick has finished top three in points in all but one year since joining StewartHaas Racing in  PERIOD After winning his first title he nearly won it again in  but would finish second to Kyle Busch PERIOD  saw him lead the points for most of the season only to blow it away during the final tenrace stretch thanks to a brutal series of engine failures PERIOD   and  all saw Harvick finish third in points after steller seasons PERIOD  was the most painful of all as he dominated the season with eight victories but would still come up short in the chase for the title PERIOD

The way that NASCARs points format works may be the culprit for Harvicks lack of championships PERIOD Under the current points system the championship is guaranteed to come down to the final race of the season PERIOD While that is great for entertainment it puts added pressure on the championshipcontending drivers PERIOD For Harvick this has been his achilles heel PERIOD When the pressure is turned up he has struggled to perform PERIOD Unless he manages to improve his racecraft under pressure a second championship may never arrive for him PERIOD

Kevin Harvick is easily the favorite to win the  NASCAR championship PERIOD His stats this season have placed him in another zip code compared to the rest of the field PERIOD Whether or not he actually gets that second championship is another matter entirely PERIOD But based on his performance so far this season dont be surprised if its Harvick raising the trophy at the end of the year PERIOD
