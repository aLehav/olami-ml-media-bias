Football is officially back and afterone of the more exciting offseasons the NFL has had in recent memory the upcoming season is already shaping up to be one for the books PERIOD The NFC has turned into even more of a powerhouse almost no teams appear to be waving the white flag on the year and after having a backup quarterback win the Eagles their first ever Superbowl seemingly anything is possible PERIOD

The summer of  for the NFL will be remembered years from now for recordbreaking contracts PERIOD The month of August saw a majority of these lucrative deals PERIOD Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers became the highest paid player of all time after signing a fouryear contract extension worth  million including a . million signing bonus PERIOD

Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald signed a sixyear extension worth  million after holding out making him the highest paid defensive player of all time for all of a day before Khalil Mack signed a  million extension with the Bears just hours after getting traded from the Raiders PERIOD

Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr PERIOD became the highest paid wide receiver of all time after signing a fiveyear contract extension worth  million with  million of it being guaranteed PERIOD

Kirk Cousins signed a three year deal with the Vikings worth  million which made him the highest paid player until Rodgers deal was signed in August PERIOD

Looking for the Browns to go winless once more Dont hold your breath as Clevelands moves this summer have them set up for serious contention in AFC North PERIOD Pairing Jarvis Landry with receiver Josh Gordon drafting Heisman winning quarterback Baker Mayfield and cornerback Denzel Ward replacing Isaiah Crowell with rookie Nick Chubb and San Francisco workhorse Carlos Hyde and bringing in Todd Haley for the offensive coordinator job are only a few of the great acquisitions the Browns have made over the offseason PERIOD The Browns might not be able to swipe the division title from the juggernaut that is the Pittsburgh Steelers but just about anything is an improvement from the Browns last few seasons PERIOD

A story that has run rampant for multiple seasons is that of the Patriots PERIOD Last year an article from Seth Wickersham was released claiming the relations between coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady are and have been severely strained along with other rumors circling about Rob Gronkowski considering retirement Belichick trying to keep Jimmy Garoppolo to replace Brady and Belichick not allowing Bradys TB12 trainer Alex Guerrero to travel with the team PERIOD It is clear that relations between the star coach and player have hit a rough patch but what could be most important to look out for past this is the play of the quarterback himself PERIOD Going into his nineteenth season and recently turning  it will be interesting to see if Brady can keep up the same level of play he has held throughout his long career PERIOD

The above barely scratches the surface of storylines around the NFL this year but the real story starts Thursday when the season officially kicks off as the Eagles face the Falcons in the first regular season game of the year PERIOD
