6797,2023-07-26,"consumers in the U.S PERIOD spent an estimated . billion on candy this Halloween season PERIOD But are we aware of what we are unwrapping with each funsize candy or namebrand chocolate Perhaps the scariest part of Halloween is what children go through to produce our favorite chocolate treats PERIOD

Understanding child slavery begins with the chocolate supply chain PERIOD Chocolate starts as a cocoa bean harvested by farmers around the world PERIOD According to the World Cocoa Foundation about  percent of cocoa comes from countries in West Africa PERIOD This is where bigname companies like Nestle begin their operations PERIOD

Though slavery is illegal in countries such as Ivory Coast it is common practice PERIOD The process often goes something like this A trafficker approaches a child and promises him work and a way to support his family PERIOD The child leaves with the trafficker by choice or by kidnapping and is smuggled to a cocoa farm PERIOD

Cocoa farmers who are paid little for what they produce depend on child slavery for lowcost labor PERIOD The U.S PERIOD Department of State estimates that more than  children are enslaved on cocoa farms PERIOD

Further poverty fuels the trafficking cycle PERIOD Children especially in rural areas are easily bribed because of their desperation for resources PERIOD Traffickers bribe parents of prospective child laborers on the same premises PERIOD Selling a child could be a last resort solution for a family who is already struggling to meet its most basic needs PERIOD

Human rights organizations journalists and multilateral organizations such as the International Labor Organization of the U.N PERIOD have been calling attention to the issue of child labor in the chocolate industry for more than a decade PERIOD In  Sen PERIOD Tom Harkin and Rep PERIOD Eliot Engel proposed legislation to increase accountability of U.S PERIOD chocolate companies PERIOD However the only result was a voluntary agreement the HarkinEngel Protocol that lacked teeth and still has not been signed by all major industry players PERIOD

The failure to pass legislation demonstrated the power of the lobbying groups of the chocolate industry PERIOD When confronted about the issue of forced child labor chocolate companies offer similar responses across the board They condemn it but say its not their sole responsibility to fix PERIOD What is true about their statements is that child slavery is a systematic problem PERIOD

Despite these complications certain brands have been able to achieve transparency in their supply chains PERIOD All chocolate with the Fair Trade label for example promises that it was made without forced labor of any kind PERIOD Nestle UK a company frequently called out for poor labor standards has recently achieved fair trade certification for its twopack Kit Kat bars PERIOD
Even wellinformed consumers may find it difficult to justify buying a more expensive chocolate bar with a Fair Trade label PERIOD However when we choose fair trade chocolate we are acknowledging the true cost of chocolate the human cost PERIOD As consumers we have the choice of rewarding companies for their lack of care for people in cocoaproducing countries or holding them accountable for their actions in hopes of reducing the prevalence of forced child labor around the world PERIOD
