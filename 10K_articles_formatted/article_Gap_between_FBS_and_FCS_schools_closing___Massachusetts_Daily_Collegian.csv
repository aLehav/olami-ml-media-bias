6003,2023-11-04,"a free and responsible press serving the UMass community since 

Up until the last few years Football Bowl Subdivision teams scheduled Football Championship Subdivision teams during their nonconference schedule in order to make the road to a bowl game that much easier PERIOD

Appalachian States  victory over Michigan on Sept PERIOD   certainly made the BCS stop if not pause that line of thinking PERIOD Also in case any teams thought that game was a fluke the upsets have only piled on since then PERIOD

Granted most FBSFCS matchups usually end up in favor of the FBS school the FCS went  against the FBS but for teams trying to compete for a bowl game the risk is starting to be a little too high PERIOD

This year the FCS already has six upsets against FBS schools PERIOD

In basketball the time for smaller schools to shine comes in March PERIOD In football however the postseason is essentially divided up by how many people can fit in your stadium PERIOD Thats why teams like James Madison treat games against teams like Virginia Tech as if its a championship game instead of simply being grateful for the experience and the sixfigure check PERIOD

Even though the game makes no difference to JMUs chances at making the postseason which starts in December the game in September is the only chance it gets at being a Cinderella. on the other hand the FBS schools  especially the ones trying to make a bowl game  look at these games as exhibitions and most of the time they are PERIOD

The school with more scholarships and depth overwhelms the smaller school by halftime which gives the bench a chance to get quality minutes in these games PERIOD

This year the FCS schools are much more difficult to beat PERIOD The most significant win for the FCS came when JMU defeated the thenNo PERIOD  Hokies and essentially knocked the school out of the Associated Press Top  PERIOD

Last week Massachusetts gave the Wolverines all they could handle with a 20point fourth quarter rally eventually falling short  PERIOD

FCS teams in the top  were already beginning to get blacklisted by FBS teams for this exact reason and this season FBS coaches across the country are vowing never to schedule an FCS team in order to avoid getting embarrassed at home PERIOD

The dirty little secret is the top six to eight teams at our level can play with anyone Dukes coach Mickey Matthews said to ESPN on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD We struggle to find guaranteed games because no one wants to play us. several things are happening in the landscape of college football that is making these upsets more frequent PERIOD

Aside from FBS teams overlooking their FCS matchups the smaller division teams themselves are beginning to produce better players PERIOD

Nineteen FCS players heard their names called during the  NFL Draft PERIOD The earliest selection came in the second round when the New York Jets selected offensive lineman Vladimir Ducasse from UMass PERIOD

That number should go up over the years as the FCS continues to improve PERIOD

Another factor is playing time PERIOD

Minutemen quarterback Kyle Havens probably wouldve had to redshirt last year transferring from a junior college had he chosen to play for an FBS school PERIOD In fact theres no guarantee he wouldve seen the field throughout the remainder of his college career PERIOD

Such is not the case with UMass where he started right away and is now arguably the best quarterback in the Colonial Athletic Association PERIOD

In fact the transfer rules in general encourage disgruntled players to play for an FCS school PERIOD The NCAA forces players transferring within the FBS to sit out one season but when transferring to an FCS school players are allowed to play immediately PERIOD

Former Michigan State running back Caulton Ray is a great example of someone who took advantage of the rule PERIOD After two seasons of very limited playing time redshirted as a freshman and had  carries as a redshirt freshman Ray transferred to Western Illinois where he made an impact immediately PERIOD

As a sophomore Ray has  yards rushing on  carries with three touchdowns PERIOD Had he transferred to anywhere in the FBS he would have to sit out another season and surely wouldnt be making the impact that he is now PERIOD

The bottom line is that the margin between the FBS and the FCS is much smaller than it used to be and that difference will only continue to shrink PERIOD Villanova is currently considering an invitation to join the Big East something that would normally be a nobrainer PERIOD

However considering the fact that the Wildcats are probably one of the bestkept secrets in all of college football  a team that dominates the FCS every year and is good enough to at least be in the middle of the pack in any BCS conference  a move to the Big East would likely ruin their mystique and they would be wise to stay where they are now PERIOD

The days where the size of a schools checkbook dictated the success of its program are long gone PERIOD As the FBS is finding out these so called secondrate programs have firstrate talent PERIOD

I feel that even some of these schools need stadiums renovations increase in sports played by by both genders invites and other factors some of these schools can and will move up to FBS ball PERIOD I think the Big East and other conferences need to separate their basketball only from their football schools because football is where the money is at PERIOD Football is Americas sport PERIOD
By  some of these and many other changes in college football as a whole I believe will happen PERIOD

Dan I didnt mean that the wins and losses dont count PERIOD I meant that it wont affect a teams chances of making the postseason the way an FBS team losing to an FCS team would PERIOD In the FCS all that really matters is beating the teams in your conference whereas an FBS school could lose out on a bowl game with a loss to anyone PERIOD

Dan									  									Sep   at  am

Even though the game makes no difference to JMUs chances at making the postseason

Adam the win actually does count toward the teams FCS win total PERIOD A win against an FBS opponent will always count PERIOD Its the FBS schools who can only count the win towards their bowleligible total if the FCS school has more than  scholarships PERIOD",Gap between FBS and FCS schools closing â€“ Massachusetts Daily Collegian,University of Massachusetts Amherst
