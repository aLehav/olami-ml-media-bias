FIU womens tennis closes out the week with wins over Houston and USF before dropping to Rice from March  to April  in Houston TX PERIOD Prior to the loss the Panthers win streak was  the longest since  PERIOD

In their first game against the Houston Cougars it was clear that the Panthers came with fire in their eyes PERIOD

Freshman Katerina Mandelikova and junior Salma Loudili pushed their win streak to eight at the No PERIOD  spot downing Maria Dzemeshkevich and Gabriela Cortes in a  barrage PERIOD

Shortly after sophomore Yasmine Kabbaj and freshman Oyinlomo Quadre clinched the doubles point for the Panthers knocking out Sonya Kovalenko and Elena Trencheva for their third straight win PERIOD

Houston down on its luck hoped to improve in singles play PERIOD

Loudili squashed that hope rather quickly kicking things off with a dominant   victory over Trencheva to give the junior standout her eleventh singles win a team high PERIOD

Kabbaj followed up with another crushing blow dispatching Dzemeshkevich in No PERIOD  singles   to give FIU a  edge PERIOD

Quadre would ultimately spell doom for the Cougars routing Sophie Schouten in straight sets   to keep the Panthers in the win column and send Houston tumbling  PERIOD

A similar fate fell to USF as FIU swatted them away in a  victory PERIOD The Bulls did manage to score a point in singles but that was quickly overshadowed by Quadre Mandelikova and freshman Ekaterina Khairutdinova winning three straight PERIOD

The Panthers fortune ended against No PERIOD  Rice Owls another undefeated team in conference play PERIOD

With Kabbaj and Quadre falling at No PERIOD  doubles  and Mandelikova and Loudili losing at the No PERIOD  spot  the team came into singles down but not out PERIOD

FIU quickly regained the lead off a pair of wins from graduate Kamila Umarova and Kabbaj but it was shortlived as the Owls would strike back to take the lead  after Loudili fell   PERIOD

Rices Maria Budin put the final nail in the coffin for the Panthers outlasting Mandelikova   to give the Owls the win  PERIOD

The baseball team came up short in their rematch against the Miami Hurricanes losing  on March   at Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field PERIOD

The game began an hour and fifteen minutes late due to a rain delay which impacted the first two innings as no team scored until the third when redshirt sophomore Brendan Roney stepped up to the plate and hammered in an emphatic solo home run to give the Panthers a  lead PERIOD

In the bottom of the third Miami junior CJ Kayfus scored the teams first run after a single from junior Zach Levenson PERIOD

The fourth inning was dominated by FIU on both offense and defense mostly due to the efforts of redshirt senior Alec Sanchez who hit a home run to give the team a  edge PERIOD

Miami senior Dario Gomez made a huge hit to left field that seemed like a home run PERIOD

Sanchez would sprint to the ball and make a jumping catch to prevent the score halting Miamis momentum PERIOD From that point the game remained at  until the seventh inning PERIOD

Junior Dante Girardi kicked off the seventh with a hit and a tough slide to second base PERIOD A Sanchez single would score Girardi extending the Panthers lead to  PERIOD

FIUs pitching allowed many walks through the game but it didnt affect them until the end PERIOD At the bottom of the seventh junior Jack Scanlon was Miamis first hitter of the inning and received a walk PERIOD

Kayfus would then return for the offense cracking a massive tworun home run to tie the game at  PERIOD

After two hitters were walked and a bunt from Roney FIU had runners at first and second bases PERIOD Girardi would hit a single allowing both redshirt junior Robert Sotolongo and freshman Roylan Quevedo to score PERIOD FIU reclaimed the lead  PERIOD

The Panthers held this lead until the bottom of the ninth inning when it was Miamis turn on offense PERIOD FIU would strike out the Hurricanes first two hitters looking to close out the game PERIOD

Sophomore Edgardo Villegas was walked with FIUs pitching doing so for the seventh time this game PERIOD Then Morales would hit a single allowing Villegas to advance to second base PERIOD

Levenson returned to the plate knowing he needed a hit to win the game PERIOD

With the weight of this game on his shoulders Levenson smashed in a threerun home run giving Miami the nailbiter win  PERIOD

The softball team concluded the week with a commanding threegame sweep of the UTSA Roadrunners from March  to April  at FIU Softball Stadium PERIOD

UTSA was held to just  hits across all three games while being outscored by the Panthers  in the series PERIOD

Game  was the closestfought contest with UTSA falling  behind stellar performances from juniors Sydney Birling and Carmen Perez PERIOD

Birling tossed her second complete game limiting UTSA to one run and four hits over seven innings PERIOD Perez hit an RBI double to give FIU a crucial  lead in the second PERIOD

The second game was over before it even began with FIU uncorking a vicious sevenrun second inning to bludgeon the Roadrunners  PERIOD

In the series finale the Roadrunners struck first scoring a run off a sacrifice fly at the top of the first inning PERIOD A great start but thats all it turned out to be PERIOD

FIU responded right after by rattling off four runs in the first PERIOD

Senior Frankie Izard started the offensive onslaught taking advantage of UTSA errors to tie the score at  PERIOD

Freshman Ella Whitney scored freshman Isabella Perez with a single and an RBI from senior Madison Lewis and a sacrifice fly by freshman Makayla Navarro gave FIU a  advantage that it would never lose PERIOD

The Panthers scored three more runs in the fourth and fifth inning to end with the win  PERIOD
