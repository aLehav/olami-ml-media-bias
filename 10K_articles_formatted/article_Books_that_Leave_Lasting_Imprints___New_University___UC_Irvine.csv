2642,2023-11-04,"i was in the sixth grade and my teacher had just decided that she wanted to read a book to our class PERIOD Her choice The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster ended up changing my life the way I looked at books and how words could be used PERIOD

The Phantom Tollbooth tells the story of Milo a little boy who didnt know what to do with himself  not just sometimes but always. he isnt interested in school and regarded the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all. then one day a package arrives for him addressed to Milo WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME and he opens it to find a tollbooth to be assembled at home for use by those who have never traveled in lands beyond. with nothing better to do Milo assembles the tollbooth and heads off PERIOD He meets a watchdog named Tock whose watch goes tickticktick and a Humbug PERIOD

The two become his companions through the Lands Beyond and Milo makes it his mission to rescue the banished Princess Rhyme and Princess Reason PERIOD

Eager for more after my teacher finished reading the first two chapters I bought the book later that afternoon and finished it that evening PERIOD I had always loved to read but this was one of the first times a books world was at once completely new and familiar PERIOD

The Lands Beyond was a place where sunsets are conducted like symphonies where sounds are collected like tangible items where one can get stuck on the island of Conclusions forever PERIOD Milos quest for the banished princesses of Rhyme and Reason becomes a quest for knowledge as he makes mistakes and learns from them PERIOD

Its all how you look at things one character advises Milo PERIOD And just like Milo I felt like my eyes had been opened to a world of unending possibilities PERIOD

As I read the book I felt like Milos journey to rescue the princesses somewhat reflected my own journey for knowledge as cliched as that sounds PERIOD He makes so many mistakes but who doesnt

I used to feel  and still do to some extent  like Milo like I could get to my destination much sooner if I didnt made so many mistakes PERIOD

When I expressed this feeling I was often given some variation of the cliche Its not the destination its the journey that counts. milo is told something similar but it meant more to me than any platitude ever did PERIOD

You often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons Princess Reason tells him PERIOD

I wondered what it meant to be wrong for the right reasons. who wants to be wrong Nobody wants to make mistakes and feel like a fool after all PERIOD

But Ive learned more from all my mistakes than I ever have by being right PERIOD Life isnt supposed to be completely figured out PERIOD We would have nowhere to go if we already knew everything PERIOD

Remember  that many places you would like to see are just off the map and many things you want to know are just out of sight or a little beyond your reach PERIOD But someday youll reach them all for what you learn today for no reason at all will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow. milos journey of discovery led me on my own PERIOD It may have been just a childrens book but it offered me a fresh look at literature PERIOD

Phrases like eat your words or jumping to conclusions took on a literal meaning in the Lands Beyond where guests are served the speeches they made and jumping to conclusions meant jumping to the island of Conclusions from which you can never jump away PERIOD

Justers treatment of words was unlike anything I had ever seen PERIOD He turned phrases I had heard for years into new ways of looking at the world one little boy Milo comes across appears levitated in the air because instead of growing up he grows down. he tells Milo that growing up means the way one sees the world changes constantly as ones height changes PERIOD But thats what growing up is all about the way you look at things changes constantly as you learn and grow PERIOD

In the end The Phantom Tollbooth is a book that contributed heavily to my love for words PERIOD The  letters of our alphabet offer us unending possibilities and the words we use have so many varied meanings PERIOD With them we have the power to make or break worlds to create and destroy PERIOD

So many things are possible just as long as you dont know theyre impossible PERIOD
