7158,2023-11-04,"despite high expectations for the season Rowan finished as the fifth seed in the NJAC and met an early exit in the conference tournament PERIOD

Throughout their turbulent  season the Rowan volleyball team was very much undefined PERIOD While the team had a ton of talent and looked dominant at times they could never put it all together PERIOD

After finishing the year  overall with a conference record of  Rowan earned the fifth seed in the New Jersey Athletic Conference Championship Tournament PERIOD However the Profsplayoff run would beshortlived asthey were swept by Ramapo College in the first round PERIOD

Id be lying if I said I wasnt disappointed head coach Deana Jespersen said PERIOD Im not necessarily disappointed that we lost some of the games we lost PERIOD Im disappointed that we didnt play with a drive or competitive nature all of the time. analyzing the brown and gold in  would be analyzing two completely different teams PERIOD

There werethe Profs that made very few mistakes and wore down their opponents PERIOD This was the teamthat beat three straight conference opponents in early October and was playing their best volleyball of the season PERIOD

On the flip side of the coin there was the inconsistent team which lacked focus made far too many mistakes and was often outmatched by their opponents PERIOD This was the squadthat ended their season on an 11game skid PERIOD

Rowan certainly put together stretches where it played outstanding volleyball but the consistency was never there every game was a roll of the dice PERIOD

I think our season never really came to fruition the way that we hoped it would Jespersen said PERIOD Coming into the season we really had high expectations but we had a lot of things that got in the way of our goals. one of the factors that contributed to the teams struggles was their lessthanidealpractice schedule PERIOD

In the past Rowan held afternoon practices in Esby gym PERIOD This season however the team was forced to practice at  a.m PERIOD in the Rec Center PERIOD

I feel like we were always tired and disorganized Jespersen said PERIOD Our days were just so disorganized and difficult because of morning practices PERIOD I think everyone is looking forward to getting back to a normal practice schedule next season. while the team as a whole struggled there were a handful of individuals who stood out this season and were recognized for their performances PERIOD

Two of Rowans outside hitters senior Danielle Havlicek and junior Erica OHagan were named to the NJAC AllConference second team while senior middle hitter Maggie Catherina received an honorable mention PERIOD

Havlicek led the team in kills with  and Catherina led in blocks with  PERIOD OHagan finished second on the team in kills  and digs  PERIOD

Another player who stood out this season was freshman middle hitter Jamie Shirtz PERIOD Although Shirtz did not receive any conference recognitions her effortdid not go unnoticed by her coach PERIOD

Jamie did a heck of a job coming on as the season went on Jespersen said PERIOD From start to finish she just got better and better PERIOD I dont think she has reached her full potential yet but as the season went on she became a force. as the Profs prepare for next year Jespersen wants her returning players use this season as motivation as they go through their respective college careers PERIOD Rowanis not far off from returning to the level ofcontender in their conference and the  season can be used as a valuable learning experience for next years team PERIOD

Im hoping that they learned to be confident and learned how to fight Jespersen said PERIOD Im also hoping that we never put ourselves in the position where we are playing without passion PERIOD Really the biggest thing that happened to them this season is that we didnt play with a desire and we werent good leaders PERIOD We need to push each other to be better and I hope that we do that next year. members of the volleyball team could not be reached for comment on the season PERIOD
