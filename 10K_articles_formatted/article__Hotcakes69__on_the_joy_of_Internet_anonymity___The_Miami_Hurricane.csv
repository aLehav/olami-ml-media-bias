Communication was once an art requiring much practice and experience to perfect PERIOD  Weve carelessly downgraded it to a common sideeffect involved in the pursuit of our motives and personal agendas PERIOD Thus are the times of highspeed Internet technology PERIOD
The old excuse that the dog ate my homework has been substituted with the server was down. what is it with this Internet infatuation And could it be remotely possible that all our new technological advancements arent necessarily for the best  Do we even know how to communicate like people anymore when not hidden behind the  bit graphics of our personal computers in the security and comfort of our own living rooms
It seems mans best friend the lap dog has been replaced by mans best friend  the laptop PERIOD  Our emotions only have to be as deep as little yellow smiley faces and we can lol even if when were not smiling PERIOD  Is this new frontier of business and personal communication really better than the traditional phone call or facetoface meeting  Is the intrinsic value of human interaction being completely eliminated by the sterile simplicity of highspeed Internet access
  It certainly feels a lot safer to spill your guts to a sympathetic stranger in a chat room someone who only knows you as hotcakes69 and who wont see you in class or at work tomorrow morning but think about what these innovations mean for society and the sentiment involved in interpersonal communication in its most traditional sense PERIOD What happens when the lines of communication become so homogenized that they begin to blur together  Will we accidentally slip into the nonchalant dialect so prevalent and acceptable in email correspondence
Increased reliance on Internet communication will ultimately lead to the decrease and consequent extinction of interpersonal skills as we once knew them to be PERIOD  I worked in an office this summer where my manager would actually email directions to us  from three desks down  Were becoming so attached to the shelter provided by this onesided communication that were forgetting how to communicate without it PERIOD  In email you can type and delete until you write the perfect response to a future employer  on the phone or in person that luxury doesnt exist PERIOD  There is no spell check for bad grammar in a  job interview PERIOD Not to mention that as youre reveling in the ability to find anyone anytime anywhere they can also find you PERIOD  Enough said PERIOD  Ill have my server contact your server PERIOD
