Sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park the cold November air biting at her blue headscarf Fadumo Osman is tired but in good spirits PERIOD

It has been a long week PERIOD Not  hours have passed since Donald Trump was elected President of the United States and Osman a CAS junior has spent the previous day consoling her fellow students and dealing with her own emotions PERIOD

It was really the first time where I couldnt tell someone that its going to be okay Osman says PERIOD I felt wrong saying it. despite this she tries to keep things in perspective and lend her shoulder to others who need it PERIOD As we talk she recognizes a student walking by PERIOD How are you doing dear Are you doing better The young woman nods and Osman smiles a little PERIOD Ill see you tonight. in a few hours Osman will speak at the Rise Above Hate rally hosted by the Muslim Students Association PERIOD More than anything else she wants the community to stand up for the most vulnerable among them PERIOD

As the political director for the College Democrats Osman has been instrumental in helping give a voice to marginalized students since she came to NYU  people like herself a black MuslimAmerican whose dad came to Canada as a refugee in  to flee political unrest in Somalia with her mother following a year later PERIOD When she was five her family immigrated to the Bay Area in California PERIOD

This wealth of experience probably has something to do with why she switched her academic focus from biomedical engineering which she saw as too specialized to computer science and social and cultural analysis after freshman year PERIOD She wanted to use her passion for technology to create tools that would help everyone PERIOD

The College Democrats and TechNYU a studentrun group for those geared towards coding and designing were among the first clubs she joined on campus attending meetings as a meek and softspoken freshman PERIOD Two years later she is on the executive board of the former bringing a unique perspective as the only woman of color in the groups leadership PERIOD

Early on she felt frustrated by the lack of action on campus by the College Democrats PERIOD She freely questioned whether or not they were active enough in the community reminding them that as liberals it was important to get out and fight for the rights of others PERIOD

I started realizing that organizing didnt just mean we all got together and talked for an hour over food Osman says PERIOD We support our brothers and sisters with whatever they are doing on campus or off campus. this is part of what drives her work  her understanding that inaction is unacceptable even if it means calling out close friends of hers PERIOD

Beyond this shes using her technology skills to organize PERIOD In the months leading up to the election she created a website to encourage Muslim women who may not have been politically active in the past to register to vote leading her to help found the American Muslim Women PAC PERIOD

I saw that the narrative was shifting from us just being victims and our friends sympathizing with us to us actually taking control and getting work done Osman says PERIOD



Thats not to mention her work with the New York State College Democrats and her time spent interning at Facebook PERIOD She has a keen sense of the ways she can take advantage of technology and data to advocate for others PERIOD Others struggle to hone this skill but Osman has displayed it so gracefully that others who work alongside her cant help but envision something larger PERIOD
I could see Fadumo as a technology executive challenging the paradigms of computing while championing diversity in her organization says Freia Lobo who has worked with Osman at TechNYU PERIOD She has strong beliefs and values and she channels those into execution. her penchant for execution is rooted in her curiosity for the individual more than anything she wants to know what makes you tick PERIOD Its a sense of awareness that the political sphere could use right now which Michael DeLuca the president of the College Democrats recognizes PERIOD
I see her creating new tools for youth political engagement pushing more women to get involved in STEM and spreading messages of love DeLuca says PERIOD He can even see her running for office one day PERIOD Well all be better off when our representatives are more like her. these are lofty goals but for now Osman is taking it one step at a time which means speaking her mind about the political challenges of today PERIOD Back at the Rise Above rally she stirs the crowd speaking about her sister a student at UCLA who had been harassed by Trump supporters the night of the election PERIOD A long week indeed PERIOD
She urges the hundreds listening attentively that just showing up isnt enough PERIOD The last time they had gathered like this was in support of the Black Student Union last year  a fight that in Osmans eyes tapered off too much PERIOD She wants to know who kept organizing after that rally and who is willing to keep up the fight now
Its a question that may make some uncomfortable and its not always easy for her to ask it but thats okay she says PERIOD For her complacency is not an option no matter how many people she has to call out PERIOD
Weve been doing the work Osman says to the crowd PERIOD Now its time for all of us to come together. read the rest of Influential  here. email Alex Bazeley at emailprotected PERIOD
