2807,2005-01-20,"the best films do better than entertain PERIOD They inspire PERIOD They enlighten PERIOD They expose the essential elements that we all share PERIOD Whether its human suffering the joys and pains of love or the epic struggle to combat ones personal demons good movies delve deep into the psyche PERIOD They draw from a rich and complicated personal experience PERIOD

So why is it that Hollywood has missed the mark so often so strongly in the past several months Why has it been so long since an authentically good film has been made Could it be that Hollywood has just run dry

They are certainly not out of stories PERIOD In recent months weve seen several films with incredibly rich and strong stories PERIOD Kinsey in particular had such a compelling back story that those of us in smaller markets pined for the local release of the film PERIOD But it sadly fell short of its potential PERIOD

Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events was another of these movies PERIOD Visually stunning the effect helped to lift up the spirit and embolden the mind but the writing fell short PERIOD From a wonderful childrens series came a mere nod towards greatness PERIOD

For every Schindlers List or Michael Collins that comes along hundreds of movies fall by the wayside PERIOD Movies with incredible stories but lackluster followthrough PERIOD Invariably they all fail in the same note PERIOD

For all of our love of explosions and gunfire the movies that have drawn us in the most have always been stories of personal conflict of overcoming internal conflict to rise above whatever external forces held them down PERIOD

Lets take Schindlers List for example PERIOD Its no secret that the real Oscar Schindler did not begin his business in an attempt to save Jews from Nazi concentration camps PERIOD He began his business in order to make money which is exactly how Liam Neeson played him PERIOD Over the course of a visually stunning movie Neeson gradually reveals the deepseated inner turmoil that eventually led to his conversion and redemption PERIOD It is that struggle that most defines the movie PERIOD

In A Beautiful Mind we have the same paradigm echoed in an interesting way PERIOD John Nash is first confronted with a need to be original a need to gain academic and intellectual supremacy over the mental rivals around him PERIOD His need becomes obsessive and dangerous but the eventual triumph and subsequent placement in a prestigious research facility is only the beginning PERIOD It echoes out instead to reveal a much deeper psychological conflict PERIOD It rings in us finds root in us as we watch horrified as it is revealed that Nashs own mind the mind that once triumphed over those around him turned against him long ago PERIOD

These are simple formulas when broken down PERIOD Character has a fundamental flaw that prevents her from accomplishing what must be accomplished PERIOD Through a difficult and often prolonged struggle she is able to overcome that flaw and thereby accomplish whatever was being held back PERIOD

We can go back and look at the greatest movies of all time and see this formula time and time again PERIOD The films that seem to fall outside always upon further study straighten up PERIOD Citizen Kane is a prime example PERIOD While Charles Foster Kane never truly overcomes his internal flaws by the time that we discover the meaning of Rosebud we also learn that he is aware of his own errors PERIOD

So if it seems to be so universal why hasnt Hollywood latched onto it Frankly its difficult to achieve PERIOD True character development requires a rare culmination of talent PERIOD The writer must be able to write dialogue that betrays inner emotion PERIOD The director must be able to develop scenes that heighten any sense of the struggle PERIOD Most importantly the actor must be able to identify with the specifics of that struggle yet be able to generalize it enough to appeal to the audience PERIOD

The good news is that some incredible films are being released to theatres in time for Oscar season PERIOD Both Million Dollar Baby and Hotel Rwanda look to be impressive contenders for our attention PERIOD Both have accomplished and seasoned actors ready to leave their mark PERIOD Both have critics foaming at the mouth PERIOD

One day Hollywood might get its act together PERIOD In the meantime its always good to give it a try to see what is out there and what will strike us PERIOD Even if it misses its mark its sure to be an entertaining adventure PERIOD
