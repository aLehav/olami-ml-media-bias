The University of Tennessee Police Department recently awarded the East Tennessee Childrens Hospital with a donation assisting in the renovation of the Hematology Clinic PERIOD The donation will directly go to the purchase of DVDs Playstation games and other electronic devices PERIOD

The idea came from Community Service Officer Michael Carr who wanted to give something back during the holiday season PERIOD Each officer reached into his or her own pockets to come up with the  donation and it was awarded to the Childrens Hospital last Wednesday PERIOD

Officer Meshia Thomas said the donation was something new for the UTPD and that they plan to continue to build their relationship with Childrens Hospital PERIOD

We are planning on future projects together since we are so close Thomas said PERIOD

The UTPDs future plans include other fundraising and personal visits originating from the belief that children enjoy meeting with uniformed police officers PERIOD

Childrens Hospital Public Relations Specialist Joanna Simeone said she could not have been happier with the results of the donation PERIOD

It was wonderful for the UTPD to give back to the hospital where some of the officers used to be patients themselves Simeone said PERIOD

Regarding the spending of the donation some would feel that books and literature would be a more responsible purchase but Simeone would disagree PERIOD

Books are wonderful but radiation and chemotherapy is a very long process that some children spend dreadful hours experiencing PERIOD The games and DVDs would make the experience better she said PERIOD

Not only will the money allow the hospital to purchase games for the children but it will also help jump start a Radiothon benefiting the Childrens Hospital PERIOD The sixth annual Star . radiothon to benefit the Childens Hospital will take place on Mar PERIOD  and Mar PERIOD  from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD

The purpose of the Radiothon is to raise money for the muchneeded specialized pediatric medical equipment that costs well over  PERIOD And the very first donation will be  PERIOD

The UTPD donation will be a great kickoff to get the ball rolling for the Radiothon PERIOD It will demonstrate to people that a program such as the UTPD can always put others ahead of themselves Simeone said PERIOD
