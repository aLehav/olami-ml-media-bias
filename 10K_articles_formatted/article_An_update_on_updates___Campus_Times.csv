3597,2023-11-04,"the Campus Times staff has worked hard on a responsive web redesign PERIOD Please bear with us as some older content may be temporarilily unavailable PERIOD To submit feedback or to report an issue email the Web Staff at onlinecampustimes.org PERIOD

If you kept track of the Campus Times Facebook page last semester you might not have noticed much PERIOD At all PERIOD Posts were infrequent and our only active form of social media presence slowed to a trickle PERIOD

Finally in December we decided to restore a social media position and began to post nearly every piece of our work to the page PERIOD Our goal is to maintain this PERIOD

After all we make our stories because theyre worth telling PERIOD So its worth ensuring each story has an audience to tell it to PERIOD

Naturally some stories especially controversial ones will garner more attention so we wont always be equally present in the community PERIOD But we certainly intend to raise our baseline presence PERIOD

Along with posting more stories on Facebook well begin posting updates on topics ranging from new projects to staff opportunities PERIOD And we plan to create staff bios that let you know who actually works on CT PERIOD Complete with photos of course PERIOD

Blurbs and videos detailing what we do on our Sunday production nights are also on the horizon  because for myself and many other staff the appeal of CT goes beyond just crafting the content PERIOD The biggest draw for me has been interacting with other members and learning everyones quirks PERIOD

Considering how open we are to new contributors its a shame our gatherings have tended to be so insular usually including only editors and columnists PERIOD And contributing and even staff writers often end up meeting only their own section editors if that PERIOD

To help remedy this we aim to run events around campus ranging from tabling to journalism workshops PERIOD And wed like to get back on the merch train PERIOD More details are on the way in those departments PERIOD

Because the more CT grows both internally and externally the more we can hone in on what matters at UR since well be more likely to hear about aspects of our community wanting change PERIOD Most of all building a larger network of people connected to us in some way will have a ripple effect on our influence and ability to impact PERIOD

More students reading CT means more students aware of important developments PERIOD It means more students having their viewpoints challenged PERIOD It means more students learning about experiences  clubs events media  that could have a lot to offer for them PERIOD

The average student has probably heard of us but our site analytics reveal how only a small sliver of those students read us even somewhat regularly PERIOD So if you start following us now youll already be joining a somewhat exclusive club PERIOD I welcome you to put that on your resume PERIOD

The future of CT offers boundless possibilities PERIOD We intend to release more content like our video of the faculty senate sitin that puts you right in the heart of a story PERIOD Our website should also see a muchdeserved boost  look out for interactive infographics and other new features PERIOD

Then again we could scrap it all and roll out GIFonly content PERIOD Youll just have to stay tuned PERIOD",An update on updates - Campus Times,University of Rochester
