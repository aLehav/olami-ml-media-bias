The Cowboys won their season opener  against UT Martin on Nov PERIOD  in GallagherIba Arena PERIOD It was guard Phil Fortes one hundredth career game as a Cowboy PERIOD

Oklahoma State clad in turquoise Nike N7 uniforms started the season off with a victory over UTMartin behind an unsurprising  points from senior guard Phil Forte in his one hundredth game as a Cowboy PERIOD

Its cool to say youve played in that many games here Forte said PERIOD Its just something small PERIOD Im just so excited for this year and this basketball team. the Cowboys won their season opener  PERIOD

After heading into the break leading  OSU  began to pull away after halftime getting the ball down low consistently and improving defensively PERIOD

We had to make a few adjustments in the second half some things that they were hurting us on OSU coach Travis Ford said PERIOD I wasnt real happy with the defense PERIOD  There were about three actions that they were doing that were hurting us a little bit PERIOD A lot of them dealt with ball screens but we corrected it. senior Jeff Newberry brought impressive defensive energy in the second half recording four blocks including a dominant rejection of 6foot8 Malik London and seven defensive rebounds PERIOD

Newberry is playing well I like his stat lines Ford said PERIOD Hes getting rebounds hes scoring a little bit and we consider him our best guard defender. the Cowboys were able to move the ball down low especially in the second half getting good production from newcomer Chris Olivier whose  points on 7of8 shooting led the offensive attack from the paint PERIOD

Coach coming into halftime just said Throw the ball down in the post the guys just got me going Olivier said PERIOD The guards did a good job Phil Jawun Evans Tyree Griffin were getting me the ball. overall the Cowboys were able to capitalize on the extensive depth their roster possesses recording  total rebounds  assists and three players in doubledigit scoring PERIOD

Our unselfishness  is going to be the key to our success this year as a team Forte said PERIOD We dont have those NBA superstars like a lot of these teams in the Big  so its just going to be a total team effort. a potentially serious negative from the game was Tavarius Shines apparent shoulder injury seven minutes into the game PERIOD A timetable has not been set for his return but the sophomore returned to the bench in the second half wearing a sling on his right arm PERIOD

Its a tough blow Ford said PERIOD Shine has been playing really well for us PERIOD  We need him back hes a very very important part of our basketball team but somebody has to step up while hes out. oSU will face ArkansasPine Bluff  p.m PERIOD Monday at GallagherIba Arena PERIOD
