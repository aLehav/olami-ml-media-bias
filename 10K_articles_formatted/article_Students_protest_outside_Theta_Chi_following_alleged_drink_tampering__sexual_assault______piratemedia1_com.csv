East Carolina University students and community members gathered outside the ECU Theta Chi fraternity house the night of Nov PERIOD  in protest following reports of an alleged drink tampering and sexual assault that occurred at the fraternity house on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

The protest began at  p.m PERIOD with approximately  students gathered on the sidewalk across from the fraternity house on West Fifth Street PERIOD Students continued to join until the protest reached about  people PERIOD Members of the Theta Chi fraternity gathered outside the side of the fraternity house to watch parts of the protest until returning inside PERIOD Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life John Mountz sat in a vehicle parked outside of Zeta Tau Alpha for a portion of the protest PERIOD The ECU Police Department and the Greenville Police Department GPD were also present monitoring the ongoing protest PERIOD

Kristen Hunter public information officer for GPD said in an email statement that GPD did not engage with the protesters or Theta Chi members but received multiple media inquiries regarding the ECU alert PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  GPD was notified of a possible sexual assault that was reported to have occurred during the timeframe noted in the ECU alert Hunter said PERIOD

Hunter said it is important to note GPD has not received any reports of drink tampering related to the aforementioned sexual assault case or any other cases currently being investigated by GPD detectives PERIOD

A protestor holds up one of their signs during the protest against Theta Chi fraternity PERIOD

A safe campus is women or men being able to go out at night time not having to worry about anything happening to them to be able to go to parties without having to worry that their drinks are going to be roofied not having to be worried that theyre going to be sexually assaulted Yardley said PERIOD

Sophomore business major and protester at the fraternity house Jayven Wyche said its unacceptable that his fellow female peers arent able to experience college and nightlife without having to worry about safety PERIOD Wyche said he worries about his girlfriend who attends ECU when she attends fraternity parties and other events because of instances of sexual assault as described in the current allegation PERIOD

Theta Chi has had similar allegations within the past year Wyche said yet he didnt hear of any disciplinary actions taken by the university or authorities following the events PERIOD

Wyche said he believes fraternities like Theta Chi are an example of white privilege as many dont receive repercussions for university violations and crimes like sexual assault PERIOD This time around Wyche said he hopes the protest will convince the university to act and that Theta Chi will be given the proper consequences PERIOD

It just gets me mad when I think like thats someones daughter what if it was my daughter you know what Im saying Wyche said PERIOD Like its just messed up. addie Drye freshman biology major said as a survivor of sexual assault herself she attended the protest to support the victims who have allegedly been sexually assaulted by members of Theta Chi in the past PERIOD Before attending ECU Drye said she had been warned by current students to not attend the fraternitys parties and no longer feels safe attending general fraternity events PERIOD

Fraternities generally receive a slap on the wrist when facing allegations like sexual assault Drye said and she wants to see effective action from the university to prevent organizations like fraternities from going unpunished when facing allegations like these PERIOD Drye said she personally feels as though ECU has not done enough in the past for victims and that they must hold fraternities accountable if they want their female students to feel safe on campus PERIOD

Protestors hold up signs and middle fingers towards the Theta Chi Fraternity house on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

At a certain point when is enough enough Something needs to be done about it and not just to Theta Chi but to everyone anyone and every report on campus something needs to be taken care of Drye said PERIOD

Senior public health major Esperes Mfwilwakanda said shes heard of many fraternities committing sexual assault throughout her time at ECU PERIOD

When she arrived as a freshman at the university Mfwilwakanda said she was told by other students to avoid Theta Chi and to watch over her drinks when attending different fraternity parties and events PERIOD

Suspension of the fraternity should be the minimum action taken by ECU Mfwilwakanda said though she believes the chapter should be completely removed from campus PERIOD She said she hopes the university pays attention to the protests message and holds responsible members accountable PERIOD

I just figured enough is enough PERIOD Its important for us to show our voice so that we can be heard Mfwilwakanda said PERIOD And hopefully we can become a change. log In
