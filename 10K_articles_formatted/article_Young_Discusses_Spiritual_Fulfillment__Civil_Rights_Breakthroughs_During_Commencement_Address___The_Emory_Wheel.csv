The only thing I could think of was that I got this paper but I dont know nothing Young said PERIOD Graduation left me with a huge question mark. as laughter replaced the silence from before Young launched into a story from his childhood PERIOD Young said that his family once stopped in North Carolina on a roadtrip from Washington D.C. to New Orleans PERIOD Frustrated by his parents decision to attend a church conference he chose to go on a run and said he was eventually subdued by a realization that he said felt greater than himself PERIOD

Whoever made heaven and earth wherever all of this beauty and creativity has come from we could not have left me out Young said PERIOD There is something there for me too. young also recalled that his greatest breakthroughs such as drafting the Civil Rights Act of  and Voting Rights Act of  came at a moment of perplexion PERIOD

We really didnt know what we were doing Young said PERIOD We had no idea how this country could change so much. keith Davis father of graduate Rhyan Davis 19C praised Youngs understanding of the spiritual self and how it connects to higher education PERIOD
