After a successful  college season and a summer soccer trip to Germany Karen Bardsley was looking forward to greater heights during the  season PERIOD However within minutes of the first game of the season things changed for the then 19yearold PERIOD

In September  Cal State Fullerton was playing a game against the University of Washington Huskies PERIOD Halfway through the second half Bardsley a goalkeeper went out to clear the ball PERIOD

I got to the ball a splitsecond before the University of Washington forward PERIOD She kicked my leg PERIOD I fell all over myself said Bardsley the  Big West Conference Freshman of Year PERIOD

She knew she was hurt PERIOD She had a broken leg PERIOD Season over PERIOD

She didnt even get a yellow card Bardsley said in a halfsarcastic halfserious tone PERIOD

After the injury Bardsley wore a cast for six months followed by a walking boot PERIOD The time away from soccer was difficult PERIOD

I got back from Germany as a member of the Englands National team on a high PERIOD It was pretty cool PERIOD Then all this shit happens PERIOD Now Im not going to play. it is scary when you are hurt teammate Lauren Welch said who has known Bardsley for two years PERIOD

Coming into her freshman year at CSUF in  Welch had heard about the accomplishments of her new teammate and was looking forward to playing alongside Bardsley PERIOD

I love her knowledge of the game Welch said PERIOD

When the injury hit Fullertons No PERIOD  goalkeeper Welch acknowledged feeling the young season was going to be a bad one for the Titans PERIOD

The season was mediocre for the Titans as they finished at  PERIOD This was after the team finished with a  record the year before PERIOD

This was the second time Bardsley had been sidelined in her young career the first being in high school after an injury to her right foot kept her out of action PERIOD It was not easy for Bardsley to deal with her injury PERIOD She began to envision life without soccer PERIOD

Kinesiology professor Kenneth Ravizza was there for Bardsley during her tough times PERIOD He helps athletes like Bardsley who have let their injuries get the best of them by helping them visualize themselves healed PERIOD

Soccer isnt everything said Ravizza who got Bardsley to stop thinking of herself as just a soccer player PERIOD The injury gave her a better perception of things. athletes returning from injury focus on how they used to play PERIOD They should focus on how much they have improved since their injury Ravizza said PERIOD

I tell athletes what doesnt kill you makes you stronger. to her credit Bardsley came back strong the following season and took home the Big West Conference  Goalkeeper of the Year award PERIOD She also helped lead the Titans to a share of the conference title along with Cal Poly Pomona PERIOD

The task was far from easy though PERIOD

The injury was very serious really bad Ravizza said PERIOD

Evermodest Bardsley downplays her strong  season PERIOD

Im only at  percent she said PERIOD

However her stats prove otherwise PERIOD She posted a record of  with a . goals against average in  PERIOD Most importantly the team played well with her guarding the net PERIOD After only winning three of their first  matches the Titans ended the season on a sevengame winning streak PERIOD

Ravizza said that Bardsley used the rehab time to her advantage and came back as a better player PERIOD

Teammate Erica Pryor who came in with Bardsley as a freshman calls her the best keeper she has ever seen. we are very confident when Karen is back at the net Pryor said PERIOD

She is quiet off the field but when the game begins Karen commands the field. bardsley was third in the league with five shutouts in  PERIOD

We all had confidence in her but even we forgot how amazing she was said Pryor after she saw Bardsley come back from injury and make unbelievable saves PERIOD

Bardsley acknowledges that personal ambition contributed to her strong comeback season that included being ranked No PERIOD  among all goalkeepers nationwide PERIOD

When Im not at my best Im not a very happy person she said PERIOD

Playing in a professional league in Europe or in the states still hovers around Bardsleys mind PERIOD

This summer she was on Englands Under21 Womens National Team that played in  Nordic Cup Tournament in Sweden PERIOD

However she acknowledges that soccer isnt everything now PERIOD The Art major has other interests in the like of art and graphic design PERIOD

Even so if the chance comes to play soccer at a professional level Bardsley said she will seize the opportunity PERIOD

Im keeping my options open PERIOD Its a bad idea to keep yourself strapped to one idea said Bardsley but if I can continue playing I will. sorry there are no recent results for popular commented articles PERIOD
