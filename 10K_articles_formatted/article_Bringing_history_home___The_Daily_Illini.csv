This house has a lot of character said Lindsay Sparrow sophomore in LAS and vice president of Kappa Kappa Gamma PERIOD Not a lot of sororities have lived in the same house for this many years. the Kappa Kappa Gamma house was completed in  and has since maintained nearly every original feature PERIOD

Theres been a few small changes throughout the house like wallpaper and basic modern additions but other than that the house really hasnt changed added Melissa Kolod sophomore in LAS PERIOD

Newly built houses have still tried to maintain their heritage as well PERIOD The Theta Xi house at  E PERIOD Armory Ave PERIOD in Champaign was just completed last year and maintains nearly the same exterior look as their old house including features such as the fraternity emblem mounted atop the front door that was above the old houses door as well PERIOD There is also a World War II memorial plaque inside the living room of the house honoring their brothers who gave their life to our country PERIOD Give them a hundred years and new houses like Theta Xis could find themselves on the NRHP as well PERIOD",Bringing history home - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
