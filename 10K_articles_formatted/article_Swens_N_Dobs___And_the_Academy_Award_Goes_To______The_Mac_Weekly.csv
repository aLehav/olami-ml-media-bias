Thanks for your blog post PERIOD I would like to say that a health insurance brokerage also works for the benefit of the particular coordinators of any group insurance PERIOD The health agent is given a directory of benefits wanted by anyone or a group coordinator PERIOD Exactly what a broker may is search for individuals or even coordinators that best go with those needs PERIOD Then he shows his suggestions and if all sides agree the broker formulates a contract between the two parties PERIOD
