A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Social media is a huge part of a college students life PERIOD It is how we stay connected to other people on campus and people from home PERIOD We like being updated on other peoples lives and we enjoy sharing our lives with others PERIOD

Did you just become an aunt Congratulations Update your status and let the world know PERIOD Did you just meet a celebrity Be sure to Tweet and share the news with your followers Facebook and Twitter are great for sharing good funny and sometimes bad news PERIOD

However there are three things that make my stomach churn when I see them on Facebook mushy statuses kissy pictures andpassiveaggressive comments PERIOD

Lets talk about the mushy statuses PERIOD If your boyfriend just took you on a date to see Lion King 3D feel free to Tweet about it because hes clearly worth bragging about PERIOD If your girlfriend just helped you with your flashcards for two hours update your status and tell the world how great she is PERIOD What nobody wants to see on Facebook is a status that says I love getting lost in your eyes Dexter PERIOD I didnt want to let go of you tonight PERIOD I cant wait to see you again in the morning These kind of thoughts are more appropriate for a diary PERIOD Not for all of your friends to see PERIOD

But even worse than the mushy statuses are the kissy pictures people post PERIOD Nobody really wants to log on and see a picture of you trying to choke your boyfriend with your tongue PERIOD I can never really decide which I think are worse The pictures of couples kissing that they took themselves or when they force someone else to take it for them PERIOD

I used to be fooled by the pictures of couples kissing that werent self portraits PERIOD I thought maybe one of their friends snapped the shot during an incredibly spontaneous and romantic moment PERIOD Sometime this IS the case and when it is the picture can turn out almost nauseatingly adorable PERIOD I learned this is generally not the case last year when I witnessed a girl hand her camera to her friend and say Here take pictures of us kissing because we need more cute pictures together on Facebook. whether you take the picture yourself or make your friends do it for you it seems a little strange to post it on Facebook PERIOD Are you insecure in your relationship and think you need to prove to all of your friends back home that your boyfriend loves you so much that he doesnt care who sees him kissing you Posting pictures like this wont make anyone forget about the huge public fight you had on the dance floor last weekend PERIOD

Take the pictures if you would like admire them on your camera frame them but please refrain from splashing them all over the web PERIOD If you really want to share your romance with the rest of the world maybe post a picture of the dozen red roses that your boyfriend just bought for you out of the blue or upload a TwitPic of the homemade dinner your girlfriend prepared for you PERIOD When those kinds of pictures pop up in your friends news feed they wont be as likely to cringe PERIOD Bottom line Dont stage cute pictures PERIOD Let them present themselves PERIOD

I would rather deal with all of my friends posting gushy statuses and makeout pictures than I would have them make passiveaggressive comments on Facebook PERIOD Im sorry but if a guy tells you that he doesnt like you like that please dont make your status read SERIOUSLY Creighton guys need to grow up. if you get into a fight with your girlfriend do you really think the situation is going to improve if you Tweet I thought we were over this PERIOD Im so tired of it PERIOD annoyed How is that going to make the situation better And if you seriously feel the need to make a status that says Just walk right by me like you dont even care that you broke my heart. well chances are that whomever you are talking about DOESNT care PERIOD Otherwise they probably wouldve stopped and talked to you PERIOD

I never have understood passiveaggressive comments on social media sites PERIOD Chances are that whomever you are talking about knows you are talking about him PERIOD Do you think he is going comment on your status and say Oh Im so sorry or I didnt mean it Take me back No PERIOD Chances are he is going to show it to his friends and laugh about it PERIOD Thats the harsh reality PERIOD So again maybe write in a journal or talk to a friend rather than sharing your angst with everyone you know PERIOD Or if you are going to share it with the world at least make it into a poorly written and catchy song first like Taylor Swift does PERIOD

Its not my place to tell you what you can and cannot do on Facebook PERIOD But do know that if you fall into any of the three categories discussed you cant really blame people for hiding your posts on their news feeds PERIOD
