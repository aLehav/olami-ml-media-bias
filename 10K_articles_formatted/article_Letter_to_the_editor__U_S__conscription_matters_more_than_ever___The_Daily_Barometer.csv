This letter is a response to an earlier column on conscription PERIOD

I would like to make the point that registering for the draft is vital to the protection of the United States PERIOD The argument given for ending conscription is that it robs young people of their rights PERIOD If Im not mistaken our rights were bought with the blood of our fellow Americans PERIOD Sacrifices including sacrificing some rights only while in the military must be made by young people to preserve our country and national ideals PERIOD

Since the beginning of our nation young people gave their lives for something greater than themselves PERIOD Ending conscription would severely hurt our capability to defend ourselves in the event of a major war PERIOD All citizens between the ages of  and  should be required to register for the draft as a civic duty PERIOD Our nation is a cultural union of many different peoples everyone should be equal under federal law and that includes draft related laws PERIOD Conscription doesnt rob young people of their rights PERIOD War robs young people of their lives PERIOD The price of freedom is a steep one and we all need to remember that PERIOD Nations pay for freedom with the blood of young people PERIOD Im not going to sugar coat that since you the reader and I are most likely eligible to be drafted PERIOD By registering we in a manner of speaking put our lives on the line for our nation PERIOD

This raises the stakes of a major war making one less likely to occur since so many young people would suffer in one PERIOD I assert that having conscription as a possibility reduces the risk of war breaking out while providing a valuable service of ensuring that our military has the resources it needs PERIOD
