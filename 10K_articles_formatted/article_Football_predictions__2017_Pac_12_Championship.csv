Its hard to beat a good team twice PERIOD Thats exactly the situation that USC finds itself in asit prepares to face Stanford in this Pac12 Championship game and thats good news for the Cardinal PERIOD We know Stanford has improved tremendously over the course of this season asit always does under Coach Shaw PERIOD This year that improvement has been even more drastic thanks to the introduction of The Gunslinger KJ Costello at starting quarterback PERIOD Stanford couldnt keep up with USC in the September shootout but with Costello under center the offense is completely different PERIOD Meanwhile Stanford has figured out how to stop the run at least a little bit whichit absolutely could not do in the first matchup with USC PERIOD Stanford forces the Trojans to put the game in the hands of Sam Darnold and he gives his team the halftime lead PERIOD But in the second half Love breaks a big run in his final Heisman statement and Costello wins the QB battle to announce his presence amongst the elite quarterbacks in college football heading into next year PERIOD Cardinal seal the game with their second interception of the night and fourth of the season against the future firstround draft pick Darnold PERIOD

Stanford is entering the game with the best player in the country PERIOD Whether he wins the Heisman Trophy or not junior running back Bryce Love will undoubtedly put on a show with the Pac12 Title on the line PERIOD However the last time the two teams met though Love may have rushed for  yards the Trojans were able to gain over300 yards on the ground as well as another300 in the air in their decisive  victory PERIOD According to OddShark USC is a current threepoint favorite PERIOD However the Cardinal have yet to lose a home game under Coach Shaw when treated as underdogs PERIOD With the game being located a mere20 minutes away from campus the Card will just add to the seasons  home record by shutting out the Trojans and proving why the North is ours PERIOD Per Stanford fashionthe Cardinal have dramatically improved as the year has progressed andthe Trojans will not be able to put them away as easily as they did in September PERIOD Harrison Phillips and Bobby Okereke will ensure that the defense stands strong against Sam Darnold and the Trojans PERIOD Though one of the best quarterbacks in the Pac12 Sam Darnold will turn the ball over multiple times and give K.J PERIOD Costello more playing time to prove why his great performance against Notre Dame was not just a fluke PERIOD In the end Stanford wins the battle  PERIOD



Sam Curry Stanford  USC 

Stanford is a completely different team than the one we saw in September on both sides of the ball PERIOD Obviously KJ Costello has given the offense a spark it didnt have before and hes done it against much better defenses than USCs but I think the biggest reason the Cardinal come out on top this time is their defense PERIOD This is a unit playing with a lot of confidence right now fresh off a performance in which they held the nations seventh best rushing offense to just  yards on the ground PERIOD Not bad considering Notre Dame ran for  yards against the Trojans PERIOD That being said I highly doubt we see Ronald Jones II and Stephen Carr breaking off big runs at all like they did in the first round of this matchup PERIOD Also his highness Sam Darnold does have a propensity to turn the ball over in big games while the Cardinal defense has a propensity to force turnovers in big games at least recently so do the math on that one PERIOD On the offensive side Bryce Love has shown few signs of slowing down whether hes injured or not and I dont see any reason Costello wont be able to lead the offense down the field as easily as he did last week PERIOD Lastly the Cardinal are a completely different team at home and while they wont get to play this one at Stanford Stadium theyll be right in their own backyard and a halffull Levis Stadium might provide a similar ambience PERIOD Either way much better than playing in the Coliseum PERIOD I think and hope this will be one of those classic games Stanford fans will talk about for years to come and the Cardinal pull away in the final seconds with a Jet Toner field goal PERIOD



Ariana Rollins Stanford  USC 

For me this game is going to come down to the defense PERIOD If Stanfords defense can hold USC to around  points the Cardinal can win this game PERIOD If were going off of the  rout from September this seems impossible but Stanford has changed so much as a team since then PERIOD Our defense has gotten much stronger especially when it comes to stopping the rush and Stephen Carr has been injured so is much less likely to do as much damage as before  though Ronald Jones II is still dangerous PERIOD Stanford is now averaging . points allowed per game compared to USCs . and ifit can keep this up then itll have a win PERIOD Sam Darnold throws picks when hes pressured Justin Reid can intercept pretty much anything  thats a great combo for Stanford PERIOD In addition KJ Costello is leading an entirely different offense than the one we saw in September with a cohesive offensive line and an actual pass attack PERIOD Plus Bryce Love is dangerous even with an injury PERIOD I see a close game but a Stanford win ifit can control possession PERIOD Can you say Bryceman



Jose Saldana Stanford  USC 

I have never liked whenever everyone picks the same team to win PERIOD I remember watching NFL FOX Sunday all pick my Dallas Cowboys to win and then they end up losing PERIOD If the game is close USC should have the upper hand PERIOD There are a few reasons The Trojans have Sam Darnold they have a good offensive line they have a good running attack and they are coming off a byeweek thanks Larry Scott PERIOD Darnold hasnt been as good as last years miracle campaign but he has a good arm and can pick the secondary apart given enough time PERIOD His ability to escape pressure was on display in the first matchup and could continue on Friday as Stanford lost Eric Cotton for this game PERIOD If the Cardinal defense is gassed during nohuddle situations then Darnold could close out the game PERIOD The dynamic duo at running back Ronald Jones II and Stephen Carr combined for  rushing yards and two touchdowns in the first game against these two teams PERIOD Stanford has had trouble stopping the run and it will be vulnerable as the Cardinal might be forced into nickel and dime versus USCs passing offense PERIOD

The Trojans are also coming off a byeweek and have had two weeks to prepare and two weeks to heal PERIOD Stanford on the other hand is playing on a short week which is difficult for any team PERIOD The  Pac12 Championship should be a cadre of offensive explosions where the more experienced passer could prove the difference PERIOD
