Charlie Ortega Guifarro  Thursday November  

Fifthseeded Notre Dame defeated the No PERIOD  seed Clemson  at home on Wednesday night to advance to the ACC Tournament quarterfinals PERIOD The Irish obtained a brace from senior forward Ian Aschieris and booked a trip to face No PERIOD  seed Louisville on Sunday PERIOD

The Irish got off to a quick start after scoring a mere  seconds into the game PERIOD Senior defender Sean Dedrick crossed the ball from the right flank into the box PERIOD His low cross was met by Aschieris who headed in a shot just inside the right post and past Clemson goalkeeper Jonny Sutherland to give the Irish a  lead PERIOD Irish head coach Chad Riley praised Aschieris for his effectiveness up front for the Irish PERIOD

This is his first real season PERIOD Hes had some injuries hes had some guys that were ahead of him PERIOD Ians going to score a lot of goals for us PERIOD With that said I think itll feel good for him to hit the back of the net because we know hes got it in him but I think he did great with his chances tonight Riley said PERIOD

The first twenty minutes were dominated by the Irish as they controlled the tempo and possession PERIOD In the 17thminute a defensive mistake by Clemson left the goal gaping PERIOD After controlling the ball Aschieris set up a shot to the lower right corner that was well saved by a recovering Sutherland PERIOD

Following that play Clemson switched from its original defensive formation of  and employed a more offensive  scheme PERIOD The difference was evident as Clemson held its footing for rest of the half maintaining possession and defending well against the Irish PERIOD

Nevertheless in the 42ndminute the Irish managed to get a good look at goal with freshman forward Jack Lynn taking a shot from the right side of the box PERIOD His shot was saved by Sutherland but the rebound fell into the center of the box PERIOD As both teams scrambled to get the ball Notre Dames senior midfielder Sean MacLeod managed to get a shot off but a goalline save from Clemson kept the Irish from doubling their lead PERIOD

The latter half of the game got off to a slow start as neither team was able to create any quality chances PERIOD The Tigers maintained their improved play and kept pushing men forward but Notre Dames defense kept Clemson from getting any good looks on goal PERIOD

In the 70thminute the Irish got a great chance at scoring their second goal after off a deflection Lynn had a chance from pointblank range PERIOD His shot hit Sutherland though and Notre Dame was unable to capitalize PERIOD

Two minutes later senior forward Thomas Ueland went down for the Irish PERIOD Team medics checked up on him prompting Riley to walk on to the field as well PERIOD

I was hoping it wasnt his head just had to see if we needed to substitute for him but he got the wind knocked out of him PERIOD You dont want really anyone to get injured at this time of the year but with him he just took a hard knock so I wanted to make sure he was doing okay Riley said PERIOD

Ueland would walk to the bench on his own and returned to the game moments later PERIOD

In the 75thminute Clemsons Quinn McNeill flicked the ball up and hit greatlooking shot from outside the box that went just inches away from junior goalkeeper Duncan Turnbulls left post PERIOD The Tigers kept knocking on the door as they tried to score the equalizer but the Irish kept making it difficult for Clemson to get any quality chances PERIOD

With just a few minutes left in regulation the Irish would score the dagger off a counterattack PERIOD Lynn would get the ball on the left side of the field and find a wide open Aschieris on the right flank PERIOD Clemsons defense had collapsed leaving Aschieris oneonone with Sutherland and one shot by Aschieris to the inside edge of the right post later the Irish booked their ticket to Louisville PERIOD

Riley praised Lynn for his performance and for maintaining his composure in the play that led to the second goal PERIOD

Jack did great PERIOD Hes been playing well all year hes causing every team he plays against  the defense is worried about him PERIOD He put in another good performance tonight and great composure on the pass to lead to Ians goal Riley said PERIOD

Lynn finished with two shots on target and one assist PERIOD Overall Notre Dame outshot Clemson  forced Sutherland to make six saves and only needed one save from Turnbull PERIOD Riley liked what he saw from his team and noted that the composure of the Irish was key to the teams good performance PERIOD

It was a mature performance is what I would call it PERIOD We got the goals I thought we were maybe unlucky not to get the second goal a little bit earlier which wouldve made the challenge for Clemson a little bit steeper PERIOD We knew Clemson was going to be a good team thats an NCAA team theyre a very good team so we knew it was going to be a tough game Riley said PERIOD

It was just a mature performance there was good composure we created a lot of quality chances and we were fortunate to put two away. the Irish will now head to fourthseeded Louisville on Sunday in an ACC quarterfinal matchup PERIOD Riley showed a lot of respect for the Cardinals and expects to see his team put up a fight PERIOD

Louisvilles got some good athleticism out wide theyre just solid well coached PERIOD Well be away from home weve had good success away from home so I think well see an exciting Irish performance down at Louisville on Sunday. share This Story
