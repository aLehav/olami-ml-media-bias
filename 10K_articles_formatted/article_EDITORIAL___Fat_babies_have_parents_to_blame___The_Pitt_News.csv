Its tricky sometimes to know whom to blame when considering the obesity epidemic PERIOD The Its tricky sometimes to know whom to blame when considering the obesity epidemic PERIOD The equation is made even more complex in light of a recent report which found that nearly  Americans  all children under the age of   are too obese to fit into the car seats that should protect them in case of a crash PERIOD

Is McDonalds to blame Should Pepsi and Nestle be reducing the calorie fat and salt contents of their products What about the supermarkets that stock these items  should Giant Eagle ban cookies and ice cream from its shelves

Some critics would say yes but this solution is too easy PERIOD Sure if it were more difficult to consume a weeks worth of calories in a single deepfried sidedishladen meal some people might be thinner PERIOD If access to junk food were restricted  if people were allowed to eat at Burger King only once a week or could have a bowl of ice cream only after they had gotten their daily veggies  people would probably lose weight PERIOD

Theres no legal way legislators could do this nor should they be looking for one PERIOD America isnt a paternalistic society our government is here to uphold the basic law of the land not protect us from ourselves PERIOD How then do we fix this problem of childhood obesity

Maybe its time yet again to look at this countrys parents PERIOD The government is not around to be a parent to citizens mothers and fathers are definitely around to be parents to their offspring PERIOD Mothers and fathers are allowed to restrict access to junk food PERIOD They are allowed to demand their children snack only on fresh fruits and veggies and to deny requests for ice cream for dinner PERIOD

Its their responsibility to do so nothing should be more important to the parent of a young child than that childs health PERIOD Without proper nutrition a childs development is severely hindered and teaching healthy eating habits has got to be a priority from day one PERIOD

So is it the supermarkets fault The fast food industrys

No PERIOD Its the parents fault PERIOD Parents with bad eating habits unfortunately are passing their apathy and ignorance down to their children PERIOD A vicious cycle is started Obese toddlers develop into obese teens obese teens to obese adults and all along the way they are afflicted with the physical and emotional difficulties of being overweight PERIOD These people pay a price for their weight but so does the rest of the country which has to shoulder the higher insurance premiums and other healthcare costs associated with obesity PERIOD

No doubt the car seat industry will begin producing wider car seats after learning of this study PERIOD If there is a demand  and there is  they will supply PERIOD Its just the way business goes and industry isnt to be blamed PERIOD

Parents are in the position to tell their children no to require that they eat a balanced diet and stay away from too much junk food  with such young children simply not keeping unhealthy foods in the house is a big first step PERIOD Its time for Americas parents to start doing their jobs PERIOD
