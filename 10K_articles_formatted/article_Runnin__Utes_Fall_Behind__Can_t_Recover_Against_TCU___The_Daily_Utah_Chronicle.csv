The University of Utah mens basketball team dropped a competitive game against the TCU Horned Frogs on Wednesday night PERIOD Utah is now  on the season  in Pac12 play PERIOD Branden Carlson and Both Gach were the leading scorers for Utah dropping in  points each PERIOD

Utah kept pace with TCU for most of the first half but a strong run by the Horned Frogs right before halftime pushed it to a ninepoint game  at the half PERIOD The Utes defense had a rough stretch and TCU scored in bunches to solidify their lead PERIOD

The Utes never quite recovered from that deficit PERIOD The lead for TCU hovered around  for pretty much the entire second half but Utah was never able to break through for the comeback PERIOD They eventually dropped the game  PERIOD

It was a tough shooting night for the Utes hitting only  of their  shot attempts PERIOD They were just  from three point range PERIOD No one seemed to find their rhythm against a tough TCU defensive effort PERIOD

Marco Anthony made his return to the lineup after sitting out a few weeks with an ankle injury PERIOD He came off the bench in his first game back with head coach Craig Smith opting to leave Gach in the starting lineup PERIOD Gach has been playing very well recently so clearly Smith felt like he couldnt make that change tonight PERIOD Anthony scored six points on  shooting to go with four rebounds PERIOD

Horned Frogs guard Mike Miles tied his career high in scoring with  points on the evening PERIOD Miles was the silencer for TCU every time the Utes would start to cut into the lead he would be the one scoring to build it back PERIOD Utah had a tough time against his speed and finishing ability PERIOD

The Utes will return home this weekend to play Manhattan at the Jon M PERIOD Huntsman Center PERIOD The game will tip off on Saturday Dec PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD MST PERIOD Utah has three more games on the nonconference schedule before moving into fulltime Pac12 play PERIOD
