1909,2023-11-04,"what does it mean to be an artist To some an artist has to paint a picture sing a song or bust a move PERIOD To others an artist has to have their name shouted by thousands of adoring fans or written in a playbill PERIOD While these conceptions are mainstream and often accurate I cannot help but challenge how unnecessarily rigid such associations are PERIOD

These definitions focus on what it meant to be an artist a year ago creating fine art sharing it in large group settings and participating in expansive promotional campaigns PERIOD However we do not live in the same world anymore in a matter of months the entire arts industry was turned upside down due to the pandemic and its safety protocols PERIOD We cannot collaborate in person PERIOD We cannot congregate in person PERIOD We cannot create in person PERIOD So if the world is a completely different place how can we even consider using an outdated interpretation of what an artist is

Right now artists should be challenging dated practices creating new opportunities and connecting in unconventional ways to ultimately improve their talents and keep their industries alive PERIOD I know this is easier said than done but hear me out PERIOD

Artists are inherently perseverant PERIOD When society pressures people to conform artists find a way to stay true to themselves and help others find their voices  like Lady Gaga and the Born This Way Foundation. when institutions silence or marginalize individuals because of their racial religious gender or sexual identity artists shout to be heard  such as Glee star Samantha Marie Ware speaking out about the mistreatment she faced on set PERIOD When it feels as if every original idea has been thought of artists always invent new genres PERIOD

The pandemic resulted in a period of time filled with an infinite amount of questions but uncertainty is the very environment artists flourish in PERIOD Equipped to adapt to the given situation explore artistic impulses and tackle any obstacle artists are taking control of their work more than ever to focus on what really matters how the art evokes an emotion challenges themselves or educates the public PERIOD

These past six months have shown that when the flashing lights and adoring fans disappear all that is left is the art Taylor Swift may not be touring the world but her new album Folklore allowed her to experiment with a new sound filmmakers may not be on set yet Homemade on Netflix is a way for them to discover what they are curious about through short films PERIOD The lack of public interaction does not mean artists or their art are worth any less PERIOD If anything an artists identity and art are more valuable than ever before PERIOD

So what does this mean for artists all over the world While this time may seem like some sort of punishment try to think of it as an opportunity PERIOD Right now is not a time to remain complacent but a moment to truly focus on who you are and where you want to go without any distractions PERIOD Listen to your voice PERIOD Pursue your passions PERIOD Find new ones PERIOD Instead of waiting for change be the change PERIOD Set a goal PERIOD Try your best PERIOD Didnt meet it Thats okay PERIOD

To be an artist you must make the most out of every situation by refining your skills defining your aspirations and redesigning what being an artist means to you and only you  ignore everyone else PERIOD Remember the artist you were and imagine the better artist you are destined to become PERIOD Rejuvenate PERIOD Innovate PERIOD Create PERIOD
