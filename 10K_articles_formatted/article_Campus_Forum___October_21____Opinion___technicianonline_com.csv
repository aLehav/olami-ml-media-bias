I am a sophomore here at NCSU and I read this paper as much as possible PERIOD Usually I skip past the stuff that doesnt interest me but I had to stop at the rape story on Friday PERIOD I didnt stop because it freaked me out or I was concerned about safety around campus at  am but because you the Technician put a picture of a suspect in the paper PERIOD

From what I understand of our law it is innocent until proven guilty and prohibits public slander PERIOD How can you as a student run newspaper bypass these laws for  I think that action makes you look bad as a student media organization PERIOD And then to have his full name without any sort of evidence to support your reasoning besides that he was seen in the area

Disgusting PERIOD

Reconsider placement of disturbing images

I was appalled at the display in the Brickyard today PERIOD I realize the University has an obligation to support freedom of speech but I was really upset by todays gruesome display PERIOD Also I dont think that in front of the Atrium was the best place to put the larger than life very unappetizing assortment of pictures and opinionated statements PERIOD

I think the University should take into consideration how offensive the displays are that are being allowed in the Brickyard PERIOD Hopefully tomorrow I can walk to class in the morning without having to dodge rockwall sized advertisements backing ultraconservative opinions PERIOD

Dont force students to see antiabortion display

I wanted to comment on the gruesome array of images on display in the Brickyard PERIOD I was appalled to walk out of my morning class and be greeted by the graphic antiabortion monument that has been constructed in the Brickyard PERIOD

It is an insult to this campus and an insensitive indecent slap in the face to the students PERIOD To have no counter opinion on display along side this blunt  is an essential admission by the campus that for whatever reason be it poverty unstable home education health of the mother andor child etc. abortion is in all cases a savage and bloody act PERIOD

Being a university with a diverse student body and an array of opinions this kind of display which is for me among others personally offensive and absolutely disgusting should not be so carelessly thrown up in the Brickyard PERIOD At the VERY least make it an exhibit invite other opinions to comment and allow those who CHOOSE to come and see it come and see it PERIOD DO NOT throw this obscene fixture into the Brickyard where it cannot be avoided force students to stumble upon it and then be so infuriatingly shaken by it that they feel they must avoid classes nearby in order to not see it PERIOD

This is not a peaceful statement of opinions  this is an insult to the entire campus and a verbal and graphic assault on its students PERIOD This display is akin to allowing a racehate group the liberty of posting violent slayings of the people they oppose in ten foot by  foot images no less

If the University is to allow this then where does it end Where is the protection of students and their interests N.C PERIOD State has no right to make its students feel so attacked especially without giving them the option to avoid these types of displays PERIOD I believe the University owes the student body and the public that traverses this campus the right to a peaceful education and an accepting environment both of which were effortlessly forgone in the permittance of this repulsive display PERIOD

Perdue is the right choice

I appreciate your thoughts in Mondays Technician regarding Perdue being more qualified then McCrory PERIOD I feel you touched on the main issues that an informed voter needs to know PERIOD I am an intern with the Perdue Campaign and I can assure that Lieutenant Governor Perdue is the only candidate running who is dedicated and qualified to lead this great state PERIOD She cares deeply about education understands the economy and wants to make North Carolina the best state in the nation. having an opportunity to actually meet her and spend time with her I can argue on her behalf as being truly personable caring and ready to take NC to a new level PERIOD Under her leadership as governor we will have a better state PERIOD

As you pointed out she is the most qualified and most importantly has proven herself as lieutenant governor PERIOD She helped save our military bases ended tobacco use in schools raised teacher salaries and has fought to win a higher minimum wage just to name a few PERIOD Perdue is the only candidate who deserves to be North Carolinas governor and will make an everlasting impact PERIOD As you mentioned voters especially college voters need to be informed on all candidates PERIOD However it is safe to say that Perdue is the right choice for governor PERIOD
