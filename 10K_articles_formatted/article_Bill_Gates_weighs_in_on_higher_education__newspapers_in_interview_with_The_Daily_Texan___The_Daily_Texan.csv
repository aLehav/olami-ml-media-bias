5972,2023-07-11,"bill Gates speaks to computer science students and various special guests at the ribbon cutting ceremony of The Bill  Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall PERIOD The building was made possible by generous grants from both the Gates and Dell Foundations PERIOD

Bill Gates chairman of Microsoft and cochairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation stopped by campus last week for the opening of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex which will be the new home of the computer science department PERIOD Gates granted The Daily Texan an email interview in which he weighed in on topics ranging from the value of higher education to the role of newspapers PERIOD

The Daily Texan Your focus has shifted from being a major player in Microsoft to being an active philanthropist especially concerning finding a cure for malaria PERIOD At what point did you decide to direct your attention to more humanitarian endeavors rather than continuing to push the limits of innovation and why

Bill GatesI am still chairman of Microsoft but I stepped down from working there full time in  to devote more of my time to the foundation.Innovation is an integral part of my work with the foundation and I believe the most difficult problems in the world can be solved by pushing the limits of innovation.Sometimes it means coming up with a whole new thing and sometimes it means making smarter use of the resources we already have and developing a new approach PERIOD Take vaccines for instance.They have saved millions of livesand fundamentally changed the world.Today there are millions of lives that can be saved just by better use of the vaccines we already have.And then there are other diseases  like malaria  that dont yet have a vaccine PERIOD Malaria vaccines are an area of intensive research but there is no effective vaccine that has been introduced into clinical practice.I am optimistic a malaria vaccine will be developed PERIOD And we are investing in research to help make that happen PERIOD

DT In Texas there has been debate at the state level over how much students actually learn in higher education and what the value of higher education really is PERIOD As someone who is financially successful without completing a higher education degree Editors note Gates dropped out of Harvardin  but received an honorary degree from the school in  yet someone who continues to fund tools for students to receive topnotch educations what is your position on the true value of getting a degree

BGThe data on the value of a college degree is pretty clear.Today  million U.S PERIOD jobs require highlevel skills PERIOD Yet only  million Americans currently qualify for these positions PERIOD By the year   percent of all jobs in the U.S PERIOD will require some form of postsecondary education.Over an adults career on average college graduates will earn almost  million more than high school graduates PERIOD In addition the unemployment rate for college graduates is about half that of those with a high school diploma.Although I didnt complete my degree I was very close.I didnt leave school because I was boredor because I didnt see the value in completing my education. i left because I believed we had a small window of opportunity to launch Microsoft.But since that time I have certainly taken a lot of college courses  either online or on DVD PERIOD Its one of my favorite things to do  so Id have to be described as an enthusiast when it comes to higher education PERIOD

DT What should universities be doing in order to better serve students in gaining realworld experience and skills what sort of higher education reform do you see as most critical to students now

BGWhile times have changed Americas postsecondary education system has not kept up with what our students and families need to succeed smarter affordable options that lead to highquality outcomes PERIOD Technology now makes it possible to bring worldclass expertise to all students  no matter what their circumstance or where they live PERIOD We support efforts that rethink the traditional classroom experience and leverage technology to structure instruction based on student achievement and reaching students where they are  while still providing teachers with the flexibility to be innovative and enhance the learning experience for all students PERIOD Otherimportant issues to address in higher education are affordability and completions rates.Im interested in exploring how financial aid can be used as an incentive not just for access to college but also for completion PERIOD

DT Many students may not feel they are techsavvy enough to work in the tech industry or that they arent familiar enough with the basics such as coding etc PERIOD What advice would you have for those students who have ample creativity but not necessarily the skill set for pushing the boundaries of what computers can do today

BG Many students may have interests that dont fit the traditional academic mold of sitting in a class and learning codingor they may not think of themselves as techy. that shouldnt limit their aspirations PERIOD Other students might be in remote locations or maybe they have families jobs or other responsibilities that dont make it practical to take on life as a fulltime student PERIOD But if a person truly is interested in new technology and new ways of learning there are so many ways to gain the necessary skills.There are great online resources like the Edupunks Guide which is an ebook that offers a comprehensive guide to learning online and helps people figure out their own path to an affordable credential.It has tutorials like how to write a personal learning plan how to teach yourself online how to build your personal learning network  ways to get college credit without taking a college course etc PERIOD

DT What do you think the role of newspapers is in an everdigitizing world As newspapers such as The Daily Texan continue to decline in print revenue and struggle to create a profitable business model how do you hope to see journalism catch up as other industries rapidly become more techoriented

BG Nearly every major industry has been transformed through technology and the news industry is no different PERIOD There will always be a need for people to get information and the way that we produce and consume that information will continue to evolve and change PERIOD Weve seen this with radio magazines television and of course newspapers.Newspapers have developed online content and social networks and some of the most successful papers are finding a way to be agile and thrive in this everchanging environment.I think it will be interesting to see how these changes continue to take shape in the months and years ahead PERIOD

DT What is your favorite TV show current book youre reading and favorite most underrated movie

BG Most of the TV I watch is either online or on DVDs  and I look at a lot.Im working on a couple of books right now.I just finished Poor Numbers by Morten Jervens which probably isnt a book a large number of people will read but I found it really fascinating.It explores how to look at wellbeing particularly in the developing world and report it. gDP isnt always a correct measure of how countries are really doing.But Ill admit that it may not be on everyones must read list. but if youre involved in global health and development like we are at the foundation its really an important book PERIOD
