National Basketball Association

Aside from exciting but short playoff runs in  and  the Washington Wizards franchise has struggled to elevate itself from the Eastern Conference basement in the last decade PERIOD However it looks like all that might change soon PERIOD  No PERIOD  overall draft pick John Wall had a stellar rookie year while healthy and should receive scoring help from veteran forwards Josh Howard andRashardLewis PERIOD Add in the continued improvement of shooting guard and forward Nick Young centerJaValeMcGee and forwardAndrayBlatche and the Wizards appear to have a bright future PERIOD DC sports enthusiasts will also be glad to hear that this season the franchise will be ditching its current color in favor of the red white and blue it wore up until  when the name was changed to the Wizards PERIOD The Wizards play in downtownD.C PERIOD at the Verizon Center where Georgetown mens basketball games are held PERIOD
