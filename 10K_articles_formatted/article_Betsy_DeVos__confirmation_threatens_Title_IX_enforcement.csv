Under President Donald Trumps administration the fate of Title IX and actions associated with it both nationally and at the University of Michigan are uncertain PERIOD

In  the U.S PERIOD Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights in conjunction with thenPresident Obamas administration released a Dear Colleague letter to universities emphasizing Title IXs prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities operated by recipients of Federal financial assistance. this guidance stipulated universities obligations to promptly respond to sexual misconduct claims on their campuses PERIOD

The University of Michigan is one of over  schools undergoing a formal investigation by the Department of Education of its handling of sexual misconduct cases PERIOD The investigation began nearly three years ago in February  PERIOD

The University has since come under fire for failing to release documents related to the investigation in a timely manner PERIOD A Freedom of Information Act request was filed against the University in  for the release of documents such as written complaints emails and other statements to further the investigation PERIOD The request was paid for in part by The Michigan Daily PERIOD

As of now the investigation is still underway according to University officials PERIOD However its continuation is questionable given the overhaul set to occur within the Department of Education in the coming weeks PERIOD

The vote to confirm Betsy DeVos Michigan native and education activist as secretary of education is expected to occur Tuesday according to CNN PERIOD DeVos is expected to be confirmed because of the projection that Vice President Mike Pence will cast the tiebreaker vote in a Senate otherwise facing a  split with all  members of the Democratic caucus and two Republicans opposing DeVos PERIOD

DeVos confirmation has been at the center of controversies surrounding the qualifications of Trumps Cabinet selections PERIOD DeVos sparked particular concern upon responding to questions regarding Title IX at her hearing in January PERIOD When asked if she would preserve the Title IX guidance her response was deemed ambiguous PERIOD

If confirmed I look forward to understanding the past actions and current situation better and to ensuring that the intent of the law is actually carried out in a way that recognizes both the victim  as well as those who are accused DeVos said PERIOD

Upon further prompting DeVos said it would be premature to affirm her commitment to the preservation of the guidance at that time PERIOD

As for the Universitys investigation in an interview with the Daily at the end of January University President Mark Schlissel said the University has been cooperating with the OCR but has not been apprised of the results of the investigation PERIOD

He said the University is looking forward to receiving the results so it can continue to foster a safe environment for students and support survivors of sexual misconduct PERIOD

Were very anxious to have the investigation resolved to get whatever advice or guidance the Office of Civil Rights wants to offer so that we can do as good a job as possible making our campus safe he said PERIOD Were committed to the concepts of Title IX  to have a workplace a study place an environment that is free of discrimination and adverse aspects so that everyone has an opportunity to learn  Im always committed to advice from OCR or other places about how we can do it better PERIOD But we havent heard anything PERIOD Were still waiting. schlissel pointed to a University campus climate survey administered on sexual misconduct in January  as proof of his commitment to the issue PERIOD He said the University is utilizing different methods to address and fix the problem PERIOD

Were approaching it through educational programs were approaching it by focusing our efforts where the survey told us the highest incidents of misconduct were he said PERIOD Were approaching it by combating the linkage with alcohol overuse which is involved in many episodes of sexual misconduct and we put out in July a year ago a revised set of policies for how we investigate and adjudicate accusations of misconduct. the updated sexual misconduct policy Schlissel referenced went into effect last July PERIOD Changes included an expanded more encompassing definition of sexual misconduct as well as adjustments to the definition of consent and the sanctioning process PERIOD

Though the University plans to keep its policy as is with the impending changes in the Department of Education the fate of the investigation is unknown PERIOD

In an email to the Daily University spokeswoman Dana Elger said the University is not going to speculate as things at the national level are still in flux though she reaffirmed the investigation is still underway PERIOD

Mark Rosenbaum a former University law professor has worked with the American Civil Liberties Union and is now the director of the Opportunity Under Law Project at Public Counsel a nationwide pro bono civil rights office PERIOD Rosenbaum said though the authority of Title IX is firmly established it is too soon to tell what will happen in regard to the investigations PERIOD

Title IX is Title IX is Title IX the law has been precisely what it is he said PERIOD Although the Obama administration was the most vigorous enforcer of Title IX of any administration where that goes from here I dont think we know. he said DeVos did not seem to exhibit familiarity with Title IX or express any commitment to its enforcement PERIOD He said he hopes and expects the Trump administrations commitment will be as resolute as that of the Obama administration PERIOD

Rosenbaum noted that by way of investigations and other related efforts the Department of Education publicized these issues and produced awareness at the student and campus level PERIOD

He said he thinks this contribution will be a driving force in addressing sexual misconduct regardless of what happens PERIOD

Not having the United States Department of Education out there is clearly not a good thing but I dont think you can reverse the momentum that the Obama administration created with respect to enforcement of Title IX he said PERIOD I think even if the Trump administration turns us back on Title IX I dont think its going to get buried under the sand. engineering freshman Lincoln Merrill publicity chair of the Universitys chapter of College Republicans claimed the Obama administration received flak for overstepping its bounds PERIOD

The law prohibits discrimination by sex or gender in an educational environment thats pretty much what it says he said PERIOD Theres an argument that the Obama administrations interpretation of it regarding sexual assault is a bit of stretch when it comes to the law itself PERIOD Thats not to say opponents of it do not care about sexual assault. merrill said though sexual assault is clearly a problem he believes the law is referring more to what is happening in classrooms and on the athletic field or discrimination in the sense of not allowing someone to take a class or play a sport PERIOD He said DeVos did not confirm a reversal of the Obama administrations interpretation of the law but said she would continue to look into it PERIOD

He said he felt sexual misconduct investigations conducted by the University should be expedited saying some sexual assault claims are not entirely true though this is very rare PERIOD Only  to  percent of sexual assault reports are found to be false according to researchby the National Sexual Violence Resource Center PERIOD He also said the legal system is a more appropriate efficient means for addressing sexual assault allegations PERIOD

I think if youre going to find out who is right and who is wrong you should really go through the police department the court and the legal process  not the University itself he said PERIOD I dont think that people who are working here for educational issues should have to spend all their time on these long investigations that law enforcement specializes in and is there to do. holly RiderMilkovich former director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center who oversaw the implementation of the new sexual misconduct policy said in a March interview that a primary reason the University expanded its policy  and along the same lines sexual misconduct investigations  was to be compliant with the Clery Act and Title IX both of which regulate sexual assault reporting and investigations at public universities PERIOD

Rackham student Nicole Bedera is one of several researchers working on a project that looks at how colleges have responded to guidance about how to interpret Title IX in the context of their campuses PERIOD

In an email to the Daily Bedera wrote she expects the Trump administration to respond differently to Title IX issues than the Obama administration did PERIOD

The Trump administration does not have the same commitment to addressing campus sexual assault that the Obama administration did she wrote PERIOD Multiple key players in the Trump administration including Betsy DeVos have spoken against the interpretation of Title IX currently used by the Department of Education PERIOD Title IX will likely remain on the books as written just as it did in the Obama administration but I suspect it wont be enforced the same way it has been in recent years in regards to sexual assault. she continued by stating she sees two potential scenarios PERIOD She thinks the new administration will create its own policies around Title IX or stop enforcing existing policies PERIOD

If the Department of Education stops enforcing existing policies there might be enough momentum on college campuses to maintain the changes made in the past two years and some campuses may even have a strong enough commitment to the fight to continue to innovate and support survivors  especially if student activists continue to put pressure on their schools she wrote PERIOD But the schools that are still failing survivors will have no reason to improve services. she added alternatively if the administration creates new policies survivors will likely not receive the same gains PERIOD

The administration has hinted that they dont see the value in many policies aimed at preventing violence against women and offering survivors resources for recovery including the Violence Against Womens Act and support for Planned Parenthood she wrote PERIOD I cant imagine the administration would be any more sympathetic to the struggle for safety on campus. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
