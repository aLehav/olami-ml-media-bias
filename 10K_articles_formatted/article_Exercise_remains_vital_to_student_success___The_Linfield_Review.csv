College is a stressful time in a students life PERIOD Theres always the next exam project essay and speech just around the corner never leaving enough time for proper preparation PERIOD

Thats why it is excessively important for college students to keep a regular schedule or routine down to help stay organized and on top of things PERIOD

Another way to make sure to never fall behind is to exercise PERIOD

The vast majority of Linfield students are athletes and even those who are not athletes work out in the weight room pool track or some other form of application PERIOD

Working out on a routine is important for young people becauseit not only keeps them in shape but keeps them healthy in the long run as well PERIOD

Having a routine creates security and foundation which a lot of students at the collegiate level need to succeed PERIOD

According to the American Intercontinental University inLos Angeles there are  reasons as to why college students should exercise on a regular basis PERIOD

Regular exercise stimulates brain development through aerobic exercise the brain creates more neurons meaning that individual will do better on cognitive testing PERIOD

Students who exercise will improve test scores but also improve their memories PERIOD

The AIU study also revealed that a regular workout slows down the shrinkage of the hippocampus in the brain PERIOD

The hippocampus controls the retention and the recall of memories PERIOD This structure in the brain starts to shrink in the early 20s and gets smaller when we get older causing memory loss PERIOD

One thing college students are guilty of is procrastination and losing focus easily PERIOD

Exercising routinely increases focus and concentration PERIOD Teachers noticed a visible difference in students who exercised before class PERIOD

Their ability to concentrate and participate in class was significantly higher than the students who did not exercise before class PERIOD

College is a wildride full of the ups and downs of academics making new friends new relationships and completely new experiences all together which is what college is all about PERIOD

But everyone has those days where they jut cant get rid of their perpetual rain cloud PERIOD

With regular exercise the sun should shine through that rain cloud in no time PERIOD

With consistent workouts not only should your overall health improve but it should eliminate stress and increase your mood PERIOD

Exercise does this because it pumps up the endorphins in the body which are basically the feel good neurotransmitters that tell someone that they are happy or sad PERIOD

Obviously there are numerous reasons as to why incorporating exercise into a daily routine is so essential PERIOD

The most important reason as to why an indi vidual should workout is because it is fun PERIOD

It just happens to have countless impacts that make life better and a little easier PERIOD
