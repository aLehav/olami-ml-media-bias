DETROIT  Despite losing the race for governor to Republican Rick Snyder Virg Bernero walked onto the stage at the MGM Grand here last night with the Rocky theme song blaring holding his and his wifes hands up in the air PERIOD

It was a fight my friends worth fighting and it was a good fight but it wasnt ours to win Bernero said just minutes after he got off the phone with Snyder PERIOD

Bernero the mayor of Lansing who ran on the Democratic ticket for governor had called Snyder to congratulate him on winning the race  one of many statewide races taken by Republicans PERIOD

In his concession speech at the Michigan Democratic Party Coordinated Campaign watch party Bernero spoke to many of the issues his campaign focused on including retaining a strong middle class freezing tuition and bridging partisan gaps PERIOD

We must not root for the failure of the other side Bernero said PERIOD We must root for the success of Michigan. throughout his campaign Bernero contrasted himself with his opponent by focusing on his experience in public office PERIOD With a political career that stretches back to high school Bernero told voters his skills would be necessary for revitalizing the state PERIOD

But unfortunately for Bernero voters decided to send Snyder the selfdescribed political outsider who made his name as a businessman to Lansing in January PERIOD

Berneros campaign platform was centered on rebooting Michigans economy with the slogan Make Michigan Work Again. during his campaign Bernero said if elected his focus would be on making Michigan the numberone place in the country to do business PERIOD His campaign promises included bringing jobs to Michigan and creating a businessfriendly tax structure in the state PERIOD

Snyder too ran his campaign on the platform of improving Michigans economic situation by creating more jobs and getting rid of the Michigan Business Tax in order to help businesses in the state  a move that Bernero has said he also supports PERIOD

Bernero also emphasized education as a way to spur economic development PERIOD He promised to increase funding to Michigan public universities prevent tuition increases and bring back the Michigan Promise Scholarship  a program in which  Michigan college students received  to  to go toward funding their education PERIOD The 100million scholarship program was cut from the states budget for the  fiscal year PERIOD

In his concession speech Bernero didnt say what his future political plans hold but in an Oct PERIOD  Michigan Daily article he said if he lost the race he would continue as mayor of Lansing PERIOD

LSA sophomores Amre Metwally and Asra Najam attended the watch party to support Democratic Secretary of State candidate Jocelyn Benson who lost the race to Republican Ruth Johnson PERIOD The pair said they campaigned for Benson for two months leading up to yesterdays election PERIOD Metwally said he had mixed feelings about the election results PERIOD

Part of me feels let down which is the natural reaction Metwally said PERIOD   Bernero and Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor Brenda Lawrence have done great things and theyll both come back. najam said Berneros concession speech reflected his bipartisan approach to uniting Michigan PERIOD

It was a very classy speech Najam said PERIOD Its clear hes not partisan PERIOD Hes on Michigans side. throughout the campaign multiple polls showed Snyder leading Bernero by a large margin PERIOD It was reported throughout the gubernatorial race that Snyder was favored to take the seat in large part because of his large personal financial resources PERIOD An Oct PERIOD  Detroit Free PressWXYZTV poll showed Bernero trailing Snyder by  points PERIOD Despite what the polls showed Bernero remained confident even yesterday morning that his campaign would pull through PERIOD

When casting his vote yesterday morning Bernero told reporters I was outspent four to one but were winning the ground game according to the Detroit Free Press PERIOD

In an effort to prevent this Democratic loss former President Bill Clinton appeared in Detroit on Oct PERIOD  to show his support for Bernero and to emphasize the importance of electing Democrats in front of a crowd of about  people PERIOD Clinton did the same for U.S PERIOD Congressman John Dingell DMich. at a rally on campus later the same day PERIOD Dingell was reelected to represent Michigans fifteenth Congressional district last night PERIOD
