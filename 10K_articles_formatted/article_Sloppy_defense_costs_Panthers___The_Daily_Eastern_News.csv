The Eastern baseball teams hot streak came to a screeching halt on Tuesday in Terra Haute as the team was shutout  against Indiana State PERIOD



Eastern head coach Jim Schmitz said in a press release that this loss was a humbling one for the team PERIOD

As good as we felt last week after beating a ranked team and going  the game humbled us pretty quickly today he said PERIOD We had sloppy defense this afternoon and we lost our identity PERIOD Strong defense and pitching is how we win games. the Sycamores scored a combined five runs in both the second and third innings and would add to the lead over the next five innings to make the score  PERIOD

Starting on the mound for the Panthers was freshman Andrew Grahn who gave up seven hits and five runs three earned in his . innings PERIOD Grahn is now  for the season PERIOD Indiana States Kyle Rupe  threw ten strikeouts in seven innings a career high PERIOD

The Panthers will compete next against South Florida on March  PERIOD
