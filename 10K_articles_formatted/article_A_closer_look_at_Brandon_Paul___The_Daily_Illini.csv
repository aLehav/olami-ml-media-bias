2436,2023-10-26,"brandon Paul is used to hearing the phrase As you go the team goes. it rang true last year when he led Warren High School to the IHSA sectional finals and was named Illinois Mr PERIOD Basketball and so far its ringing true this year in his first season as an Illini PERIOD

At just  years of age the freshman guards play often tends to determine how the rest of the team will fare PERIOD Head coach Bruce Weber said the squads emotions on the court usually stem from Paul and fellow freshman D.J PERIOD Richardson PERIOD

However both Paul and the Illini have run into trouble as of late and Paul must learn to leave his high school game behind if he wants to win in the Big Ten PERIOD In the meantime lets take a look at how the top high school player in the state of Illinois got to this point PERIOD

What drew you to Illinois

I really liked the school PERIOD I really like this coaching staff PERIOD Its close to home and my brother comes here and my family can come watch the games  and it was the players PERIOD I liked to watch Dee Brown Deron Williams and Luther Head play PERIOD The coaching staff was great and Coach Weber has a great winning tradition so I definitely wanted to come here. what about your high school friends

A lot of my friends stayed home to go to school so I knew if I came here I could have a lot of my friends come down to the games and thats what happened. was there anybody who tried to sway you at the last minute before you signed with the Illini

My mind was pretty much set so there was nothing really I could do. whats your relationship like with fellow freshman D.J PERIOD Richardson

We like to hang out PERIOD Hes a great guy PERIOD Hes always got laughter in him and hes always got jokes so hes always really funny PERIOD On the court we like to get after it PERIOD We just like to push each other. whats happened to your game lately

Sometimes I think Im thinking too much into the game and that I can just be doing the little things PERIOD I can be taking charge playing defense things like that  I feel that I still have a lot of room to grow so if I can keep my mind focused I can get better. is there anything that has surprised you so far in the Big Ten this season

Not really PERIOD Its great a lot of basketball and every game counts PERIOD Weve got to take every game seriously.",A closer look at Brandon Paul - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
