Updated November     pm



As expected freshman guard Ryan Appleby completed his transfer from Florida by signing his letter of intent to play hoops at Washington announced Husky coach Lorenzo Romar yesterday PERIOD

Appleby was the only recruit to sign yesterday  the first day of the NCAA spring signing period PERIOD

Appleby a 6foot3inch point guard from Stanwood was a firstteam allstate selection in  following his senior season at Stanwood High School PERIOD He averaged  points and nine assists per game that season PERIOD

 said Romar PERIOD 

Last season Appleby played in  games for the Gators but only averaged eight minutes in each of those outings PERIOD Appleby has cited his lack of playing time at Florida as one of his primary reasons to transfer PERIOD

Florida granted Appleby a release from the school April  enabling him to retain his remaining three years of eligibility PERIOD In order to comply with transfer regulations Appleby will need to sit out the  season as a redshirt PERIOD Consequently Appleby will likely fill the void left by current guard Will Conroy after he graduates next season PERIOD

 said Washingtons Mike Jensen of Appleby PERIOD 

A part of Applebys decision to transfer can likely be attributed to Washingtons recent success on the court PERIOD The Huskies finished last season with a record of  earning a spot in the NCAA tournament for the first time since  PERIOD

Appleby is not the only highly touted local recruit who has recently sought a release from his initial school of choice PERIOD Nationally recognized Rainier Beach High School star C.J PERIOD Giles originally committed to Miami in November but has since requested a release from the school citing the recent firing of coach Perry Clark PERIOD The Seattle Times reported that the 6foot11inch Giles sees Washington as a  if he is granted such a release PERIOD

Washingtons only other signed recruit of  is small forward Joel Smith of the Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro N.H PERIOD Smith signed with the Huskies on Nov PERIOD  during the early signing period PERIOD

The UW mens hoops program has one scholarship remaining to offer a member of this years class PERIOD The spring signing period ends May  PERIOD
