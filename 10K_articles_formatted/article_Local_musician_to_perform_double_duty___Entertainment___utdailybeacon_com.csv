Shane Myers the front man for Caution is now a member of the popular

local band Mr PERIOD Skinny PERIOD

Caution is well known around Knoxville as a Grateful Dead cover band which

has a knack for exciting fans with wellplayed versions of the songs which

put the Dead in the spotlight around the world PERIOD

Myers wants to discredit any rumors that Caution will dissolve as a result

of his move to Mr PERIOD Skinny PERIOD That is not the case PERIOD Caution fans should be

pleased to hear that the band will continue to play on the strip covering

Dead songs PERIOD However Myers would like to emphasize that Caution is only a

side act for him now PERIOD

Myers wants to get a chance to play more of his original material PERIOD The

opportunities to do this with a cover band are limited PERIOD He said he has

always had a good time playing for Caution and he does not want to give it

up but he needs to be more serious about his personal musical career PERIOD Mr PERIOD

Skinny plays material which is predominately original PERIOD Myers said he will

be able to play a great deal of his own music with the new band PERIOD

Mr PERIOD Skinny has one of the biggest followings in Knoxvilles local music

scene and Myers said that his addition to the band will increase its

following because the people who like Caution will come to see him PERIOD

Myers is enthusiastic about this change PERIOD  he said PERIOD

Mr PERIOD Skinny is a relatively new and young band PERIOD Their lead Davis Mitchel

is  and drummer David Sharp is only  PERIOD Other members include Kerry

Archer on keys and Jeff Mingard playing bass PERIOD Myers said he believes Mr PERIOD

Skinny is on the verge of breaking through the ties which accompany an

average college band because they can already pack a bar to its walls with

eager fans PERIOD

Myers said the numbers coming to see Mr PERIOD Skinny will continue to grow as

they establish fame and recognition throughout our area PERIOD He said he

believes the band has the potential to become widely popular PERIOD

Fans of Mr PERIOD Skinny and Caution will be able to see at least one of the

bands in Knoxville every month this fall PERIOD As usual Mr PERIOD Skinny will play in

various bars around the region but they will come home to Knoxville often PERIOD

Caution will do the same PERIOD
