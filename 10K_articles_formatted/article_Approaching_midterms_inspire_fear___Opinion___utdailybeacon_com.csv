If youre like me and I hope to God youre not then youre probably entering that wonderful phase of the semester when the training wheels come off the professors stop attempting to convince you they care and tests seem to pop up more than Ralph Nader presidency announcements We get it youre not dead yet PERIOD But seriously Ralph its hard to be an antiestablishment candidate if you are essentially the established antiestablishment candidate you feel me PERIOD

Yes my fellow embattled peers it is midterm season PERIOD Like election season wabbit season and hockey season most people would rather hide their heads in the sand and ignore the entire business PERIOD Thats great for them if they have like jobs with like money and stuff PERIOD But we dont have that luxury No PERIOD Entire futures can rest upon whether or not you can correctly identify the speaker significance and latent homosexual undertones of a select passage from Sir Baltimore Fennimeres Victorian bestseller The Tube Socks of Lady Beatrice. heaven help the undergrad who seeks education in lieu of study guides PERIOD

Midterms are strange beasts PERIOD They combine all the stress and most of the weight of finals without the blessed consolation of never ever ever having to think about the class again PERIOD Seriously whats the point of a test if you cant forget everything it covers the minute after its over It is beyond me I assure you PERIOD

But midterms are what they are so one best learn how to deal with them instead of doing something crazy like changing majors having a stroke or meticulously cutting off strands of your roommates hair while he sleeps with the utmost caution saving them in your files for the day when your Frankenstein will need a toupe premurderous rampage PERIOD Not that Ive ever thought about that or anything PERIOD Ever PERIOD At all PERIOD But seriously what kind of selfrespecting monster would go about maiming and pillaging bald Its just not how these things are done PERIOD

So having gone through my fair share of midterms I thought Id try to devise some possible ways to work off steam to get you through the coming weeks PERIOD

 PERIOD Think of Better Things To Come Spring Break PERIOD Summer Break PERIOD Christmas PERIOD Graduation PERIOD Increasing postcollege isolation followed by years of regret and nostalgia PERIOD The cold yet firm grip of a merciless death PERIOD All of these will come to pass eventually PERIOD The midterm is just another incident in the long dreary funeral dirge we call life PERIOD Its hardly the end of the world although thatll happen too sooner or later PERIOD

 PERIOD Get a Terminal Illness Few things can cause you to reevaluate your priorities more than your own impending demise PERIOD Your midterm goes from priority number one to number  on your list of Things I will do ironically and then laugh at once dead. if you dont believe in an afterlife then youll be too busy venting your unceasing existential rage at a callous unfeeling universe to remember the revolutionary business model of Reginald P PERIOD Luorline III esq PERIOD in the real estate market of  L.A PERIOD for Introduction to Crapology  PERIOD

 Hunt the Homeless The recent bipolar nature of the weather has drastically affected the local hobo populations PERIOD The weather fluctuations have lowered their natural defenses leaving them confused dazed and ripe for the culling PERIOD If youre the type of person who constantly fears explosions of hobo populations and their inevitable uprising then this is the perfect time to let off some steam and destroy those who are human by the definitions of science alone PERIOD Studying can wait PERIOD The hoboscience alliance must be stopped And now my friends is the time to do it PERIOD

 PERIOD Wears Pants AT YOUR OWN PERIL PERIOD

Seriously PERIOD Study for the damn midterm already
