With more winter storms on the way students often choose to escape to Las Vegas for warmer weather PERIOD However they might not know the hidden hills of Cathedral Gorge an adventure wonderland perfect for hiking and basking in the sun PERIOD

Located a few hours west of Cedar City Cathedral Gorge State Park allows SUU students to experience more of Iron County as well as visit Nevada while avoiding the Las Vegas traffic PERIOD

The state park is located only one mile north of the small town of Panaca Nevada.When first entering the park the visitors center is available to guests who wish to have more information as well as pick up a map of the park to various trails PERIOD

The geology of the park was formed by a freshwater lake that covered the land nearly one million years ago PERIOD As the lake dried erosion took effect and gave the park its cathedrallike appearance

One of the most rewarding trails is the Miller Point Trail located about halfway into the park PERIOD Although the trail can be accessed from the road driving through the park and hiking through the south end provides a more scenic route PERIOD

The trail winds through several passes between the hills and eventually ends with metal stairs to the top PERIOD Once on top a slight birds eye view of the park can be seen PERIOD The Eagle Point trail which can be accessed in the northern entrance of the park provides a fuller birds eye view PERIOD

Information on the parks other trails are found here PERIOD

To get to Cathedral Gorge State Park turn west on  North and follow the road all the way to Panaca PERIOD The road will end on Nevada Highway  and then turn north PERIOD The south entrance with the visitors center will be on the west side of the road about one mile up PERIOD

The park will cost five dollars to enter and may require a selfpay service if no staff is available PERIOD Camping is also a possibility costing only  dollars a night with an additional ten dollars a night for utility hookups PERIOD The park is also open seven days a week all year long PERIOD
