Each week as part of our Roving Reporter series an Aggie reporter will walk around campus and ask random students a question specific for that week PERIOD The questions will cover a variety of topics such as If you could switch places with anyone in the world for one day who would you switch places with and why or If you invented a class that would go on the mandatory list needed to graduate from college what would the class be

For this weeks Roving Reporter The Aggie asked students the following question If you were Becky with the good hair what would your response to Beyonces Lemonade be For those who dont understand the reference in Beyonces new visual album Lemonade she sings He only want me when Im not there  He better call Becky with the good hair. on a surface level listeners may think that Becky is a mistress of Beyonces husband Jay Z and there were rumors of who that person actually was PERIOD However the album itself is not only a statement on the marriage between Beyonce and Jay Z and Jay Zs potential infidelity but it is also a sharp commentary on racism in the United States as it pertains to hair texture PERIOD Historians and members of the black community have explained that good hair is a phrase used to describe the hair of someone who is usually of mixed race and the inference is that Becky has desirable straighter hair PERIOD

The term good hair is problematic because it implies that black women who dont have wavy straight hair have bad hair. this inference sheds light on the perception of black femininity showing the discrimination that black women face because their hair is deemed as unprofessional and the favoritism that mixed African Americans receive because of their good hair. the inference is that Becky is a representation of the privilege that black women with straighter hair have benefitted from since slavery PERIOD The truth of the matter is black hair is anatomically not the same as white hair PERIOD Black women have been manipulated by a vast number of industries that make ridiculous amounts of money off of the idea that black women should strive to have good hair or hair thats as similar to white womens hair as possible PERIOD

The Aggies Roving Reporter article yesterday was in poor taste and has since been taken down PERIOD The reporter and subsequent editors did not understand the true meaning behind the lyrics when talking to students and no black students were interviewed for the article PERIOD I understand why students at UC Davis are upset by this writing an article about a phrase that has such strong negative connotations in the black community and then not speaking to black students for the article is insensitive and ignorant and I apologize for the oversight PERIOD

The Aggie does not want to perpetuate stereotypes racism or discrimination of any form and failing to understand or catch racial undertones or commentary is no excuse for this newspaper to produce content that contributes to further ignorance and racism PERIOD There have been issues of racism in The Aggie in the past most notably the Jungle Fever opinion piece written in  PERIOD Nobody from The Aggies current staff was around in  and certainly there is no way to defend the words of that article PERIOD I hope that while students should remember that article for its unequivocal offensiveness nobody equates an article written five years ago with the convictions of todays Aggie staff PERIOD

The Roving Reporter article was a massive oversight and I am sorry for offending anybody and for perpetuating any discrimination or racism PERIOD I will do everything I can to inform myself and my staff to ensure that nothing like this happens again at The Aggie PERIOD The UC Davis Diversity Education Program offers workshops in cultural sensitivity and has a specific workshop in Culturally Respectful Training and I have already reached out to the Office of Campus Community Relations to set up a workshop for The Aggies staff PERIOD

Thank you all for your continued readership and I appreciate students bringing issues like this to my attention PERIOD
