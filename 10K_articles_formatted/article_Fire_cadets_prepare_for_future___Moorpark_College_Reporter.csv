Jorge Figueroa hated heights PERIOD

The 23yearold was rigged into a climbing harness and was putting all his trust into a few meters of rope some carabineers and the men above him PERIOD

Figueroa was not rock climbing PERIOD

He was rappelling down the side of a stairwell simulating an old apartment building in an exercise to prepare him for an actual rescue if an emergency should break out PERIOD

Figueroa is a cadet in the Oxnard College Regional Fire Academy PERIOD

Were going to try something new said one of the instructors PERIOD

He told Figueroa to walk his legs up the wall until his back was flat against the wall wrap his legs around the lead lines holding him and turn  degrees so he was crawling down the stairwell like Spiderman PERIOD

Figueroa was not pleased and was happy to have his two feet on the ground when he was done PERIOD However he now has one more piece of ammo in his arsenal to battle against the various dangers he will meet as a fire fighter PERIOD

The graduating class of the fire academy Battalion  is small just like the trade the cadets will go into PERIOD This solidifies the brotherhood Clark enjoys as well as creates a second family for the service men and women PERIOD

Its a very small industry and you cross paths when you get into fire service said Petersen PERIOD Its a small family and they learn to get along that way PERIOD Its a nurturing thing for them to do. the academy cadets learn about all career options related to the program including Emergency Medical Technicians and dispatchers PERIOD However they all go through the same rigorous training at the fire academy PERIOD The cadets go through  hours of training that includes hose operations ladder drills low angle rescue drills fire chemistry vehicle rescue and other simulations PERIOD

Its a prestigious job PERIOD Just be physically fit PERIOD Always be ready to work PERIOD Its not easy PERIOD Its pretty difficult said Clark PERIOD They expect a lot out of everybody PERIOD If youre going to do it be serious PERIOD Train like your life depends on it. the cadets of Battalion  will be graduating on Dec PERIOD  at the Oxnard College Regional Fire Academy at the Camarillo Airport in a ceremony at  a.m PERIOD The cadets will be running a number of simulations before the ceremony showing off their newly acquired skills to friends and family PERIOD
