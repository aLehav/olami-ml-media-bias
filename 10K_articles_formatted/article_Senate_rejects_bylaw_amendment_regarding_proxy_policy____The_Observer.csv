Kathryn Muchnick  Thursday October  

The Notre Dame Student Senate convened for a brief meeting Wednesday night to debate a proposed amendment to the bylaws on senator attendance PERIOD

After roll call and announcements from student body president Daniel Jung the assembly debated resolution SO  which would update the Senate bylaws to require that proxies be members of the same dorm or organization as the absent senator PERIOD As it stands anyone can proxy for an absent Senator  voting in their stead during the meeting  regardless of their dorm PERIOD

The resolution would also disallow other members of the Senate to proxy for absent members of the Senate including nonvoting members PERIOD Student body vice president Aidan Rezner explained that the goal of the resolution is to ensure that all votes are represented accurately PERIOD

Several senators expressed their concerns about finding someone from their own dorm who would be willing to proxy PERIOD

I feel like on both fronts I strongly disagree with this said Paul Stoller class of  president PERIOD As it is right now it is incredibly hard to find a proxy and Im sure anyone whos tried to find a proxy knows that. its my third year doing this its hard PERIOD So  I understand the rationale but putting more limits on this is just going to be a mess. several senators also explained that by looking at the minutes beforehand they can prepare their proxies to vote as they would regardless of dorm PERIOD

Hall Presidents Council cochair Peter Schimpf explained a situation where nonvoting members can proxy for voting members of the Senate while still having their organization represented PERIOD

Between the two cochairs of Hall Presidents Council only one of us has to be here to represent Hall Presidents Council and were both nonvoting members PERIOD So two weeks ago cochair Bridget Schippers was here representing Hall Presidents Council and I was here proxying for Paul Stoller Schimpf said PERIOD

In that case there was no double counting of votes PERIOD I was very clear on what I was supposed to do and how I was supposed to represent his views on the issues. judicial Council president Koryn Isa said that even if a senator looks at the minutes beforehand they should still be required to send a proxy from their constituency PERIOD

When the agenda is sent out there is a potential to have to vote on something that you could not have told your proxy exactly how to vote for Isa said PERIOD And to have a proxy that is not part of the constituency when youre trying to vote on something that was changed from the original agenda they just wont have the background to know what people from your team would want. the resolution failed to pass with only six senators voting in favor of the bylaw change PERIOD
