Updated November     pm



Vogue magazine is at the centre of controversy after the only sportswoman in its list of the worlds top  powerhouse women was transgender cyclist Emily Bridges PERIOD

The 21yearold athlete has campaigned against a British Cycling ban on trans competitors taking part in the female category of the sport and as a result has been featured in the league table included in the publications September issue PERIOD

Other women in the rankings include pop singer Raye  BBC breakfast host Naga Munchetty  and 55yearold Kylie Minogue and Queen Camilla  PERIOD

Among the critics of the lack of other sportswomen in the fashion Bibles list were campaigner and former Olympian runner Maya Yamauchi  the 50yearold British longdistance track and road running athlete who currently holds the third fastest time by a British woman over the marathon behind former worldrecord holder Paula Radcliffe PERIOD

She said on social media Right now there are numerous fabulous female athletes in Budapest competing at the World Athletics Champs PERIOD

In other sports too thousands of fabulous female athletes British Vogue could have chosen. fiona McAnena director of Fair Play for Women told the Daily Telegraph Emily Bridges is not yet a successful international cyclist so its hard to see why Bridges is there PERIOD

Katarina JohnsonThompson became the World Champion in the heptathlon she is a world champion in a really tough event PERIOD She should be in there not Bridges. british Cyclings ruling that bans transgender women from racing in the female category was made in May and has caused uproar among trans activists but a wave of support among gender critical activists PERIOD

At the time of the decision Emily branded the move as genocide against trans athletes PERIOD
