 Roeders said PERIOD 

This was the second consecutive shutout for the Badgers over the Golden Eagles as they had defeated Marquette  on Sept PERIOD   at Madison PERIOD

 Roeders said PERIOD I dont know of the three who has improvedThe focus is so much on us to play at a certain level PERIOD We want to ask ourselves does our style work against other styles we have to face.Some kids go back home and play with their club teams and some will stay in Milwaukee and train with us PERIOD The rules are restrictive PERIOD The burden is on the kids themselves.Its our last year of Conference USA play and I think were good enough to win leagueWe want to make our last go around a good one. the student news site of Marquette University",Wind holds team back â€“ Marquette Wire,Marquette University
