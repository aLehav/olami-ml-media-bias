Kevin Cronin has been the lead singer of REO Speedwagon since  PERIOD While he is not the original he is the singer of some of their bestknown hits including Keep on Loving You and Cant Fight This Feeling. cronin and the band will be playing at Assembly Hall on Friday at  p.m PERIOD

DI How has the live show evolved to what it is now

KC Our live show has got a core of around  songs that if we dont play those songs every night there is a pretty good chance there will be an angry mob outside of the tour bus PERIOD Unfortunately those were songs that were big hits for the band but we still love to play them PERIOD We love playing Ridin the Storm Out Take It on the Run and I Cant Fight This Feeling. people identify with the songs and we know what people want to hear PERIOD We also play two or three songs from the  album Find Your Own Way Home. those are the newest and freshest and they are always fun to play live PERIOD

Then the third category is audibles PERIOD It comes from a pool of songs that we used to call album cuts PERIOD They were not really hit singles but fan favorites PERIOD They vary in different regions different parts of the world so we vibe out the situation and pick them out PERIOD

In Champaign being a very special town for us well be playing some songs like Golden Country and Son of a Poor Man where a lot of other parts of the country may not be familiar with it PERIOD They can be songs we played at the Red Lion Inn in the early 70s PERIOD



In Champaign we have just so much history PERIOD I wrote Golden Country sitting on the Quad PERIOD I used to sneak into the music building and sneak into the piano studio PERIOD The whole campus area is a really fertile ground for us PERIOD

DI You are from Evanston Ill. but the rest of the band is from Champaign PERIOD What kind of connection do you feel with the community

KC The band kind of accidentally heard about me when they played up in Chicago PERIOD I moved to Champaign when I joined the band PERIOD I went from being a folk singer to being in a rock band PERIOD REO Speedwagon were rock stars the kings of Champaign PERIOD I was thrust into that role

I lived right near campus and hung out on Green Street PERIOD Also at Red Lion Inn if we didnt play there we were hanging out there PERIOD

There is a connection PERIOD Every night I mention Champaign Ill. because thats our roots PERIOD Without students of U of I and Champaign we wouldnt be where we are PERIOD

DI Is there any way to prevent the band from becoming a nostalgia act How do you as musicians try to fight that feeling if there is a feeling at all

KC Were vigilant about that PERIOD There is a part of what we do that is nostalgia and any band from the 70s or 80s that denies that is a fool PERIOD The majority of the people are coming to hear those songs from the 80s that we love PERIOD We have no problem with that we love singing those songs PERIOD

Still if we strictly go out there and regurgitate the 80s I would be bored still  couldnt do that PERIOD Continuing to write and record is essential but I know Im realistic PERIOD When we released Find Your Own Way Home it was definitely one of the best albums we have ever made but I have to understand its not going to sell  million copies PERIOD But its important to continue to make them PERIOD

Music is a living breathing art form it evolves PERIOD I walked into a bar in Indiana accidentally and a tribute band for us was playing PERIOD Their trip is to listen to the old records and mimic them precisely PERIOD I thought that was horrible PERIOD Hopefully weve improved on that a little bit PERIOD To hear someone sing it the way I sang it  years ago is like looking at an old high school yearbook PERIOD

DI How do you feel about your songs being used in films and commercials

KC I think its great fortunately we have control over it PERIOD Anyone who wants to use our songs has to first get our permission PERIOD We are very protective of our songs  they are our children in a way PERIOD

We like it to be something we relate to PERIOD Cant Fight This Feeling was in Horton Hears a Who. it was cool to hear Jim Carrey Steve Carell and Carol Burnett and sang the song as Dr PERIOD Seuss characters PERIOD I have three little kids so we went to the premiere PERIOD

DI What is one thing you would like to accomplish as a band before your time is up

KC I think for me I want to be the last guy standing PERIOD I look at a guy like Tony Bennett one of the great singers of all time and as time has gone on his contemporaries have stopped singing PERIOD I see that with my contemporaries PERIOD I think that as time goes on maybe the fact that we are still doing it will cause people to take another look and give us a chance PERIOD

Thats what keeps me going to exceed peoples expectations PERIOD

DI What are you listening to these days

KC I love the latest Foo Fighters record and I am just starting to get into the new Metallica record PERIOD I just bought the new Randy Newman record and its wonderful PERIOD I put this record on and it makes me smile he is such an amazing writer PERIOD Theres a little bit of a political undertone not overt but hes just so clever with his wordplay PERIOD

Also with an 11yearold do you think I havent heard The Jonas Brothers",Rock 'n' roll legends of Champaign return to UI - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
