Remember Me



Celebrating its 25thanniversary this fall season Staller Center for the Arts featured a seasonally festive spooky and whimsical performance of the Broadway musical comedy The Addams Family this past Sunday evening PERIOD The Staller Center was fortunate enough to house the production on its tour of North America just in time for the week of Halloween PERIOD

Based off of Charles Addams cartoon strips regularly published in The New Yorker until  the musical comedy was written by Jersey Boysauthors Marshall Brickman and Rick Ellis with musical score and lyrics by Drama Deskwinning composer Andrew Lippa PERIOD Fourtime Tony Award winning director Jerry Zaks completes an allstar production team that successfully weaves together a cheerfully morbid musical that subverts traditional notions of the ideal American family PERIOD

The musical production presents an original story following some of the wellknown and beloved characters of Charles Addams cartoon strips Gomez Morticia Wednesday Pugsley Uncle Fester Grandma and Lurch PERIOD Wednesday Addams confides in her father that she has fallen in love with a boy from a seemingly normal family neither macabre or undead PERIOD The news that Wednesday has met a boy that is alarmingly conventional and ordinary hits Gomez Addams hard but to make matters worse the two families need to struggle to make it through one incredibly awkward lightheartedly blunderous dinner PERIOD

Many Stony Brook University students may be surprised to learn that The Addams Family musical is in fact based off of the characters of Charles Addams comics rather than the sixties sitcom PERIOD In fact the television series was actually the first of many adaptations created in response to Addams characters PERIOD A prolific cartoonist for the New Yorker from  until his death in  Charles Addams characters expressed a uniquely dark humor extolling a morbid and eccentric aesthetic PERIOD The characters of The Addams Family essentially represent an inversion of that quintessential family seeking the American Dreamthese characters are seemingly wealthy living a luxurious lifestyle in a gloomy yet comfortable mansion PERIOD Notably the Addams are not evil in the same way that most other familiar Halloweenthemed characters are PERIOD Rather they simply enjoy an unconventionally dark sense of humor and beauty presenting a refreshingly different take on that American family traditionally represented in cartoon strips PERIOD



Drawing from this element of the dark yet lighthearted The Addams Family Broadway production successfully leaves its audience feeling pleasantly and cheerfully spooked PERIOD Acting and singing are equally fabulous as would be expected from a group of wellversed Broadway professionals PERIOD Gomez and Morticia Addams are played by Jesse Sharp and Keleen Snowgren respectively both of whom are experienced in the game of nationalinternational touring and have acted in numerous countries around the globe PERIOD The fantastic princess of darkness Wednesday Addams is played by the upandcoming Jennifer Fogarty PERIOD Costumes and set design are perfectly dreary and funereal with a touch of the humorously bizarre making for a delightfully creepy display that satisfies the craving for Halloweenthemed entertainment this week PERIOD

The Staller Center certainly picked a perfect week to book this spooktacular Broadway production that has won the hearts of many PERIOD With this fall season being prime time for attentiongrabbing performances as the Staller Center celebrates its 25thanniversary what better way is there to bring the greater Stony Brook community together than by holding a traveling Broadway production perfectly suitable for the week of Halloween Doubtless many of Sunday nights audience members are feeling pleasantly satisfied to have begun their Halloween with a viewing of this show and are eager to continue the festivities later into the week PERIOD
