8151,2021-03-10,"a car exits the highway and stops at a red light outside of a warehouse PERIOD Two union organizers standing on the sidewalk wave hello and strike up a short conversation PERIOD The cars driver is one of the  Amazon workers in Bessemer Alabama where the first union election at any of the companys U.S PERIOD warehouses since  began last month PERIOD And the organizers from the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union in nearby Birmingham are optimistic PERIOD

Inside the building the warehouse bosses plastered the bathrooms and breakrooms with antiunion fliers PERIOD On the companys internal app they post antiunion propaganda featuring smiling pictures of workers who dont support the effort PERIOD And they hold mandatory daily meetings to convince the workers that they dont need a union PERIOD

But right after those meetings end the workers return to their grueling tenhour workday where computers track their every move PERIOD If they dont work fast enough or take too many water breaks workers run the risk of losing pay or even their jobs PERIOD Lunch breaks are so short that after walking through the 14footballfield long warehouse workers dont have enough time to pop a meal in the microwave PERIOD Of course if you like to scarf down daysold unrefrigerated GrabnGo sandwiches like a desperate seagull that might not be a problem PERIOD For everyone other than my cocolumnist less time than needed to warm up food isnt even a break PERIOD

Right now workers across the U.S PERIOD wait in anticipation of the results of the union election which ends on March  PERIOD If the workers win itll be one of the biggest labor successes of the twenty-first century  a success that all Americans desperately need PERIOD

See over the last seventy years the American labor movement has lost almost all of its twentieth century power PERIOD Union membership which peaked at  percent of the workforce in  has since fallen to  percent PERIOD States across the country have enacted righttowork laws that make it difficult to unionize PERIOD And with the rise of the gig economy more and more workers are classified as contractors which means they cant join unions PERIOD

Besides that a lot of workers today dont think that they would be helped by a union PERIOD Take tech workers PERIOD Theyre paid relatively well get lavish benefits and before the pandemic often worked in futuristic compounds with nap rooms and bikes PERIOD Why should they unionize What more could they possibly want

Or even take staff at our college who dont have a union PERIOD The lowest wage Amherst pays is about three bucks more than Massachusetts minimum wage and word on the street is that Amherst pays pretty well in comparison to other area jobs PERIOD If they get paid so well why unionize

Company bosses often use this as one of their primary arguments against union efforts PERIOD They say that workers already get paid well and that a union would just cost them money in dues PERIOD When Amazon forces its Bessemer workers to attend antiunion meetings this is what it tells them PERIOD However union workers make more in wages and benefits than their nonunion counterparts PERIOD And what the bosses wont tell workers is that unions do far more than just bargain for better pay and benefits PERIOD

Rather unions help us build worker power by bringing us together to fight for each other PERIOD The structure of wage labor ensures that individual workers are powerless in the workplace PERIOD If we speak out against the bosses were fired PERIOD And if our coworkers try to protect us theyre fired too PERIOD But when everyone stands up together and says that enough is enough theres nothing that managers can do to put us down PERIOD

This isnt just some abstract thought experiment PERIOD Unions protect workers from unfair policies safeguard worker safety and give workers a voice in the way a company works PERIOD All of this is impossible without solidarity and the incredible potential for change that results from banding together PERIOD Theres a reason that the slogan goes The people united will never be defeated. most importantly unions help us realize what it means to work together towards a common goal PERIOD They give us the skills to do that in the workplace and beyond PERIOD And in the process they fight for necessary change in real life whether new policies at a specific company or stronger laws that help everyone PERIOD

Even if you think that you get good benefits and pay you need a union that will stick up for you if that ever changes PERIOD You need a union to make sure you get paid if youre injured on the job PERIOD You need a union to make sure that bosses cant fire you unreasonably PERIOD And you need a union to make sure that you actually have a say in the way your company  the company that makes its money off of your labor  is run PERIOD

All workers even those who arent union members benefit from unions PERIOD Labor organizing got us the weekend and the eighthour work day PERIOD Unions won us workplace safety laws and bans on child labor PERIOD But these fights arent over PERIOD Americans work longer hours  and suffer from worse health as a result  than workers in other postindustrial democracies PERIOD We can change this but we cant do it one by one PERIOD We need a powerful workers movement PERIOD

Students faculty staff and alumni you need a union PERIOD You may already work in a job without one and if so I encourage you to unionize PERIOD Think about what it would mean to build power in the workplace make more money and have better job security PERIOD Consider what solidarity with other workers could accomplish PERIOD

And students odds are that you wont work in a traditional union job after you graduate PERIOD However that just means its even more important that you join a union  its up to our generation to be trailblazers in the next iteration of the labor movement PERIOD Just like the workers before us we need power in the workplace power that we can use to make our lives better PERIOD

And if you wont unionize for yourself then at least do it for your neighbors whether theyre next door or from a town like Bessemer Alabama PERIOD Unions help all of society not just individuals PERIOD

As the late Senator Paul Wellstone said We all do better when we all do better. the workers of the twentieth century knew it PERIOD Will we",Seeing Double: You Need a Union,Amherst College
