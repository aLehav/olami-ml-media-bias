Six years older but definitely not wiser the Jersey Shore cast proves old habits die hard in the first three episodes of Jersey Shore Family Vacation. with triple the cost of my tuition in plastic surgery the roommates head to Miami to reunite for one more GTL Gym Tan Laundry PERIOD

The last season of Jersey Shore aired in  with a pregnant Snooki sober Mike and a together Ronnie and Sam PERIOD In Feb. MTV announced Jersey Shore Family Vacation pleasing many fans who anxiously awaited closure to the captivating lives of their favorite guidos and guidettes PERIOD Now three episodes into the season do their lives still have that spark that enchanted viewers six years ago

Most of the roommates have settled down since  but it quickly becomes apparent that not everyone has left their party days in the past PERIOD Nicole Snooki Polizzi and Jenni JWoww highlight their newly domesticated lives each with a guido husband and two children PERIOD Their children account for most of the drama the pair face PERIOD It almost seems as if they are milking the motherhood card for every last bit of drama PERIOD Deena Cortese recently got married and is coping with the death of her father this season PERIOD

Mike The Situation Sorrentino is in the midst of a tax evasion lawsuit which hinders his ability to travel to Miami with the rest of the group PERIOD However he eventually makes it to Miami to be the groups designated driver PERIOD

DJ Pauly D is touring the world and has since had a daughter and is the only single roommate on this vacation PERIOD

Vinny Guadagnino became a certified health god and moved out of his parents house although he still sees them every day PERIOD

Ronnie OrtizMagro is expecting a child with his girlfriend Jen Harley PERIOD

The only one missing is Sammi Sweetheart Giancola who chose not to participate in the reunion but is talked about and portrayed in creepy doll form PERIOD

The styles may have changed since the first season but the cast of Jersey Shore certainly hasnt PERIOD While their lives may seem more put together the roommates can still party like its the early 2000s PERIOD

The premiere episode showed all the glitz and glamour of a former guido turned reality show celebrity PERIOD The episode had a familiar taste of drama and fake tanner which showed promise for the rest of the season PERIOD However the second episode didnt evoke an urge to fist pump along at home PERIOD The drama was superficial and seemed like the exact same thing viewers experienced in the previous seasons which could be perceived as a positive or negative addition to the reunion PERIOD

The second episode did bring some excitement to the show PERIOD Between the horrible pop  songs that MTV feels the need to include in every single scene transition the episode revealed that Jenni had a miscarriage in  and then became addicted drugs known as downers and uppers. a revelation that was never again addressed after the news broke it seemed as if the producers were reaching for some drama and grabbed ahold of the first thing they could find PERIOD It is certain to come up again as the show loses momentum PERIOD

Episode three was filled with short bursts of drama while the rest of the episode felt exhausted PERIOD The roommates go to a club and naturally drama ensues  a habit that seems a bit childish for a group of people in their 30s PERIOD However this frivolous behavior is what made the show so popular in the first place PERIOD Ron complains about Sam and then invites a group of girls back to the house PERIOD The episode concludes with the producers hinting that Ron mightve cheated on his baby momma with one of the girls from the club PERIOD This scandal is sure to keep fans watching until at least next week PERIOD

While some scenes seemed rehearsed the roommates prove that their personalities friendships and love of fake tanner can still captivate an audience eight years later PERIOD With foreshadowing of cheating tears drama and maybe jail time the rest of Jersey Shore Family Vacation seems promising if you can overlook the reality TV show effect PERIOD
