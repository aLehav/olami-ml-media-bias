Hirokazu Kosakas On the Veranda which opened Sept PERIOD 3marks the forty-sixth installment of the Pomona College Museum of Arts Project Series PERIOD

Founded in  by senior curator Rebecca McGrew the Project Series celebrates advancements and creativity in contemporary and underrecognized art created by Southern California artists PERIOD

Kosaka was born in Japan in  just three years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki according to an essay by McGrew that was published in conjunction with the exhibition PERIOD Kosaka came to the United States in  to study at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles PERIOD

After finishing his studies Osaka began to explore body and performance art attempting to marry modern avantgarde practices with the thousands of years of culture and history derived from his heritage PERIOD For Kosaka the word verandasignifies the areas between definitions the gray between black and whiteor as he put it in an interview with KCET Television in Los Angeles the infinite maybes. on the Verandaselects works from Kosakas early artistic years  PERIOD Chronologically the final piece on display is Soleares in which Kosaka played the flamenco guitar for forty minutes with a razor blade inserted into his index finger before he embarked on a threemonth 1000mile journey along the coast of Japans Shikoku Island PERIOD The photographs documenting his journey form a collage on the back wall ofOn the Veranda. a major challenge for McGrew and her cocurator Glenn Philips of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles was how to deal with performance and body art within the museum setting PERIOD

A lot of these pieces were done with no audience they were ways Kosaka could explore ideas McGrew said PERIOD There isnt any footage of a lot of these performances so how to convey their meaning was something Glen and I had to think about. pineapple Juice is an example of such a performance PERIOD In the piece Kosaka covered himself in pineapple juice to attract moths to his body as he sat with a kerosene lamp PERIOD In On the Veranda this performance is represented in a single striking photo as the moths flock to Kosakas masked face and lamp conjuring images of a lighthouse and the artists continuous search for meaning PERIOD

Buffer Zone uses video to document one of Kosakas works PERIOD In a protest of the Vietnam War produced in  Kosaka brought together many of the overarching themes consistent in his art incorporating movement and spatial reconstruction into one piece PERIOD After running through a rope maze Kosaka would push participant Maggie Lowe a fellow artist to the ground and sift dirt onto her body PERIOD According to the museums description of the piece he repeated this process more than  times PERIOD This performance is projected on a wall opposite Soleares in the exhibition PERIOD

In the center of the exhibit is a small box filled with poppy seeds PERIOD Kosakas written reflection accompanying the piece informs us that it is a representation of kalpa the Sanskrit word for an eon of time PERIOD In his reflection on the piece Kosaka goes on to explore the relationship of time beings and space PERIOD

McGrew is drawn to the complexity of thematic elements within Kosakas work PERIOD In her essay she writes that his art looks both to the past and the future melding seemingly disparate values such as beauty and pain east and west or modernity and tradition into a singular artistic expression PERIOD She hopes that the exhibitions visitors will appreciate the depth of ideas and the many elements that Kosaka brings to his work PERIOD

Hirokazu is very spiritual  Hes a seeker trying to make sense of the world McGrew said PERIOD Hes bringing his spirituality and upbringing to the avantgarde. a few students who stumbled into On the Veranda accidentally one night at an Art After Hours event were taken aback at the physically demanding nature of the work PERIOD

You have to respect the dedication to the art Hayley Marber PO  said PERIOD This guy sticks razor blades in his fingers and runs for five hours straightall for his art. on the Veranda will run through Oct PERIOD  before it is replaced by the forty-seventh installment of the Project Series Ret Skuch Heckleby Krysten Cunningham PERIOD The Pomona College Museum of Art is open from noon to  p.m. Tuesday through Sunday except Thursday when the museum is open until  p.m PERIOD for Art After Hours PERIOD
