Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Paul KirkMarch  

NIU employees who think theyve been passed up for better jobs by minorities are unaware of a training program incorporated into the university which temporarily places minorities into departmental positions PERIOD

The program came to attention when a report came from the physical plant that trainees were being employed in shipping positions at salary with all the benefits of fulltime workers PERIOD The memo said that the trainees were hired past the civil service procedures PERIOD

However Richard Flournory placement supervisor of personnel confirmed the training program but said the program does not violate civil service procedure PERIOD

The employees are in a training spot PERIOD They dont bypass the register because theyre not on the register PERIOD Theyre being trained to pass the register test Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory explained that the program is split into two basic parts PERIOD The first division emphasizes the placement of minorities into positions while the second division focuses on placing trainees into departments PERIOD

The program has been used by several departments throughout the university PERIOD Flournory said that minorities had been placed as route drivers inventory clerks secretaries in the international program the library program and telephone services PERIOD

Flournory said the program was minorityspecific but not racespecific PERIOD The program places racial minorities but also places women and disabled PERIOD

The program is mostly utilized by women and minorities Flournory said PERIOD The program increases the number of minorities and women that are capable of getting on employment registers. the Learner Training Program placed  people in January PERIOD Flournory said two were white males while  were white females PERIOD

Flournory continued to say that the Personnel Training Program placed  people in January PERIOD Four were male while  were female PERIOD Flournory said that all  were minorities PERIOD

The program is larger now than it has ever been Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory said the department strictly follows the guidelines set down in the Statutes and Rules of Civil Service laid out in September of  PERIOD

The main office in Champaign tells other branches to call here and talk to Rich Flournory PERIOD We do it right Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory said the campus benefits through the affirmative action policies of the training programs PERIOD

The program helps fill positions train individuals to be placed on registers and creates a better pool of employees to pick from Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory said the program has met with huge success since its induction at NIU in  PERIOD

Quite a few departments are using the program Flournory said PERIOD The departments are asking for more of the program. flournory said that the program is expanding but he is worried about educational budget cuts PERIOD

It always seems like an easy program to cut when budgeting comes around Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory said he hopes the goals of the growing program will be to expand the number of people being placed and the number of jobs available to minorities PERIOD

He also hopes to add a program in the future to move more women into supervisory positions PERIOD

Flournory explained that departments use the training program to fill positions which they cant afford to keep in their own budget PERIOD

The Learner Training Program employees are paid through our department while the Personnel Training is paid for by the departments Flournory said PERIOD

Flournory said the training programs are not permanent positions and that trainees have to hope to find jobs after their intern periods PERIOD Trainee periods can last between three months and five years PERIOD

Thats the major difference between the trainees and full time employees Flournory said PERIOD There is no guarantee of a job. however The departments become reliable on our trainees but when their terms end they dont have the money to fill the position PERIOD They rely on me to place someone else or theyre forced to double regular employees work loads Flournory said PERIOD
