A small crowd of  students sat in the room most of whom are members of the club that want to pursue a career in broadcasting PERIOD

Beto Duran a former EC student and current blowbyblow broadcaster for Golden Boy Promotions was one of the two guests speakers PERIOD

The other speaker was Jamie Maggio an EMMY Award winning University of California Santa Barbara graduate and current Spectrum Television host for the Lakers PERIOD

Maggio has also worked as a sportscaster for Fox Sports TNT and KCAL PERIOD

The event took awhile to put together because of the paperwork necessary to file with the school in order to bring a guest to campus according to Jonathan Ortiz the treasurer of the club PERIOD

I wish it was easier to bring in professionals to campus Ortiz said PERIOD More people would have showed up if the process was not a hassle. despite a small crowd the students were happy that Duran and Maggio came out to give them advice and tips PERIOD

Freshman student and member of the club Diego Perdom said he liked the fact that the speakers were honest PERIOD

I liked how they were not sugar coating anything Perdom said PERIOD Its not as easy as one may think PERIOD It takes hard work and you are going to be denied many times PERIOD They said that you need to have thick skin in order to get through and succeed. its been  years since Duran was a student at El Camino PERIOD

He said that hes all for any advice that he can give to a fellow Warrior PERIOD

Coming here was a good experience it reminded me when I was a student Duran said PERIOD You can hear the passion and you can see the excitement PERIOD Believe in yourself never take anything personal work harder than anybody else and when one door closes find another door to push open. according to the Emmy Award winner Maggio being confident and being yourself is going to make you a better sportscaster PERIOD

Being someone that people want to work with is important she said PERIOD Being reliable hard working and nice are some of the many qualities you need honestly. the student news site of El Camino College",Local reporters speak to the broadcast club about their careers - El Camino College The Union,El Camino College
