The original  revitalized the foundfootage horror genre paving the way for myriad metoos PERIOD And though  aims to be more refreshing its stock characters and shallow thrills weigh the proceedings down PERIOD

A cross between  and  the film follows a team of explorers who decide to delve into the catacombs beneath the streets of Paris PERIOD Its discovered that theyve entered a city of the dead spookhouse hijinks ensue and the audience  heres hoping  doesnt fall asleep PERIOD

The performances are among the few semiaffective aspects of this film PERIOD Sure every team member fits his or her horror movie stereotype and Id be hard pressed to find one character who I genuinely cared about PERIOD

That said the ambitious Lara Croftesque Scarlett Perdita Weeks shows hints of intrigue and there is even a bit of camaraderie early on among the rest of the group PERIOD Everyone does an admirable job with the material given which is more than I can say about the cast of many recent horror films PERIOD

 opening is one of the worst Ive seen this year as it has virtually no connection to the rest of the story PERIOD The mythology too is so messy that I rarely knew what these explorers were even searching for PERIOD

Ultimately though the movie just isnt scary PERIOD Although audio should be an integral part of almost any horror film  relies too heavily on cheap jump scares PERIOD Theres no tension  only the anticipation of a loud noise PERIOD

The movie uses its claustrophobic environment to its advantage on a couple of occasions  not often enough PERIOD Seriously this film wouldve benefitted as a firstperson reimagining of 2005s 

Im surprised this movie didnt release in January PERIOD Cmon August PERIOD Youre better than that PERIOD
