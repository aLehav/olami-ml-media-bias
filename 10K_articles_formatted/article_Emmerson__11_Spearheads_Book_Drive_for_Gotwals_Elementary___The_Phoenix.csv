Shortly before spring break book collection boxes appeared around campus as part of a book drive for K4 childrens books for Gotwals Elementary School in Norristown PERIOD The book drive is the result of a long relationship between Melissa Emmerson  and Gotwals Elementary PERIOD

Emmersons work at Gotwals began in the fall of  when she observed a second grade classroom for a course in Language Minority Education PERIOD In the spring she continued to observe in the same classroom for her Literacies and Social Identities class and volunteered at the school on her own time last fall PERIOD Currently she is a member of a research group in her Literacies seminar working on a smallscale ethnography at Gotwals focusing on the ways that English language learners experience literacy in the classroom PERIOD

Gotwals student population is  Hispanic and Norristowns Mexican immigrant community has blossomed over the past decade PERIOD Faced with underresourced classrooms and a growing population of English language learners Gotwals Principal Jeanette Fernandez suggested to Emmerson that a book drive for childrens books would be a great help to the school PERIOD

With the help of some friends and fellow education students Emmerson took on the project PERIOD Although much of her work at Gotwals has been for classes at Swarthmore the book drive is not related to an academic assignment PERIOD Emmerson said Its just because Im in love with the school and want to give back to them. the book drive has already collected about three hundred books and aims to reach five hundred PERIOD The drive is seeking childrens books of all genres in both English and Spanish PERIOD

Collection boxes in student dormitories will remain there until March  PERIOD After that the only boxes left on the Swarthmore campus will be in academic buildings with the hope of encouraging professors to donate PERIOD A number of the boxes will move to Bryn Mawr and boxes will also be placed in sites in the Ville including TBumbles Executive Cleaners and the Creative Living Room PERIOD Though collection in dormitories will end next week collection at these other locations will continue through the end of April PERIOD
