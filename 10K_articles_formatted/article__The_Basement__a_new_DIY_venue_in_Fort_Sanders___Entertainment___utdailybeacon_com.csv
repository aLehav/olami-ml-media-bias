 venue is a lowkey music venue that has only hosted three shows PERIOD

 Highland Avenue looks like any other student house in the Fort Sanders neighborhood  from the outside that is PERIOD

Past the little front porch and down the stairs theres a hidden gem in the rough a basement musical venue PERIOD With a title none other than The Basement this grungy lowkey venue has only had three shows with a surprising amount of visitors from places like Chattanooga and Nashville PERIOD

Spray painted phrases left from its frat house days line the walls with sayings like Go Vols and some that could not be printed due to vulgarity PERIOD Fabric drapes one side of the wall in order to create a more venuelike feel and in the corner sits a small setup with a few guitars basses and amps PERIOD

The three UT students who live in the house are Aaron Cage Tyler Cage and Tyler Clark the first two are actually twins PERIOD They moved in two years ago to the old frat house but only started using their basement for parties and music more recently PERIOD

We actually moved all this equipment downstairs because someone reached out to us and asked to play in our house Tyler Cage said PERIOD

Their last show was much more calm than what you would expect from such a DIY venue someone brought a puppy and it just slept on stage the whole time PERIOD Most all of their shows have been very laid back PERIOD

 Highland Avenue is where the  music venue is located inside the Fort Sanders neighborhood PERIOD

People go out at like  or  I feel like it would be cool for us to have a space where people can come and stay for an hour or so before they go out Tyler Cage explained I would love to have a show every weekend but we would have to have a lot of traction for that plus we are also all in a band so we travel and play Tyler Cage said PERIOD

On the side the three are developing a band together that has been in the works since last summer PERIOD It is currently still unnamed PERIOD

We just booked a weekend at a recording studio in Atlanta so hopefully we can have an album out soon Aaron Cage said PERIOD

The next show at The Basement is Feb PERIOD  and the bands TOPNachos Future Crib and Vanosdale will be playing PERIOD All three bands have a punk rock sound and they are traveling down from New York to play PERIOD

My personal goal is to have some more punk bands in here to where people can go crazy and mosh but definitely make it as safe as possible Aaron Cage said PERIOD

Although they have gained a bit of a following in a small amount of time they are approaching struggles with trying to get the venues name out there PERIOD Additionally they struggle with maintaining it as it is a basement PERIOD For the first show Aaron spent upwards of  hours trying to clean organize and make the basement look presentable PERIOD

Were really just trying to find ways to make this space cooler every time Aaron Cage said PERIOD

Even though The Basement is currently designated for music the crew wants to expand upon that creative outlet PERIOD

I want us to be a space for local and community art so my hope would be that we have some bigger bands open and give light to the smaller bands in townI would also love for local photographers to come shoot a show and get some concert experience PERIOD Graphic design people can make our posters or maybe put work on the walls I just want it to be a space that people know and come and be creative. log In
