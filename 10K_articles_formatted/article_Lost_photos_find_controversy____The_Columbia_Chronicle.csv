Found Photos in Detroit has come under fire for graphic photographs that include mugshots photographs of child abuse and homicides PERIOD

By Assistant Arts  Culture EditorFebruary  

No matter who you are you have probably taken a selfie PERIOD But chances are nobody takes your selfies and uses them in an art exhibit PERIOD
Taking pictures of daytoday routines is a common part of life PERIOD Photographing pets foods and places then posting them on social media outlets like Twitter Facebook and Instagram has become second nature PERIOD
Now imagine finding your Twitpics in an art exhibit  years from now. the Museum of Contemporary Photographys new exhibit Archive State features collections of found photographs compiled by artists working from all over the world who aim to use found also called vernacular photography to reflect periods of significantsocioeconomic change. im sure that the subjects in any of these  found materials including the YouTube videos had the expectation that their photograph their video would be recontextualized said MoCP Executive Director Natasha Egan PERIOD
Running through April  the exhibition features the German artist Simon Menner Thomas Sauvin a French artist working out of Beijing Akram Zaatari founder of the Arab Image Foundation and David Oresick who submitted images of American soldiers in Iraq. the MoCP housed in the Alexandroff Campus Center  S PERIOD Michigan Ave. will hold a public reception for Archive State on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD
The most controversial part of the exhibit is the Found Photos in Detroit collection which features photography and documents left in abandoned Detroit homes and
government buildings PERIOD Some show explicit content including photos of homicides child abuse and private pictures from family albumsraising issues of privacy and ethics. some of the viewers were more concerned in ethics the use of the images and photographs said Found Photo in Detroit artist and photographer Arianna Arcara PERIOD Another part was more concerned about is it correct to show this kind of work to make people talk about the problem
Italian photojournalists Arcara  and Luca Santese  collected the documents for the Detroit exhibition which made its U.S PERIOD premiere on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD
The project received similar reactions in France Italy and Sweden. found Photos in Detroit began in August  after Arcara and Santese found Polaroid photographs in a vacant police station in downtown Detroit PERIOD The project continued during a second trip in early  PERIOD The two spent a year narrowing down materials including handwritten documents from the roughly  pieces collected Arcara said. we found the Polaroids firstand we fell in love Arcara said PERIOD We thought it was something different that it was something so powerful and so we decided to search for it. arcara said she thinks the collection documents the disenfranchised people of Detroit without exploiting them PERIOD
At the end the problem is that we didnt take these pictures so its not like Im deciding what to show Arcara said PERIOD We really tried to treat it as an archive PERIOD We just showed what we found. senior Film  Video major Mike Miller said he thinks the fact that the photos were found strengthened the work but also raises major ethics questions PERIOD
Thats kind of the beauty of the photographs theres the anonymous artist aspect Miller said PERIOD Then theres always the question of authorship and is it yours if you find it or is the artist whoever created it originally
The pictures are uncomfortable because no viewer is far removed from the subject matter Egan said. during a Jan PERIOD  panel discussion with both the artists and Columbia faculty from the Photo Department ethical questions the work raises were addressed. in the panel someone suggested its like being in an anthropology museum and that these are studies of objects Egan said PERIOD Whats most difficult is theyre very current PERIOD This is not looking at something in the distance PERIOD Its sort of looking at our time right now which is really hard to look at in an anthropological way. the artists encourage photo subjects who recognize themselves to contact them PERIOD However nobody has reached out yet Arcara said. in a way they would return back home Arcara said PERIOD But actually me and Luca we were in Detroit like  days ago and a lot of the buildings were torn down in that time PERIOD All this material would have been lost. miller said he thinks critics of the exhibit do not have legs to stand on. i think for them to have a say in it theyd have to have talked to the subject initially Miller said PERIOD
Egan thinks Found Photos in Detroit is no different in concept than the other artists work but it still carries a unique meaning PERIOD
Are we invading their privacy Egan said PERIOD Yes PERIOD Is there a difference between a woman in front of her refrigerator in Sauvins Beijing work and the picture of a girl and her birthday cake up in the Detroit workbut when you add the fact that the Detroit work is crime neglected evidence material the weight is very different. no matter who you are you have probably taken a selfie PERIOD But chances are nobody takes your selfies and uses them in an art exhibit PERIOD
