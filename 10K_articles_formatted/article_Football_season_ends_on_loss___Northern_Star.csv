By  Ryan OstryNovember  

DeKALB  It was a tale of two halves in Mount Pleasant Michigan resulting in a  loss for the Huskies against Central Michigan putting them at an  record to finish the regular season PERIOD

Its disappointing Head Coach Rod Carey said PERIOD We had that within our control and our whole focus was to get back and win the MAC West. the defense got going early with its fifth interception of the year and second return for a touchdown by redshirt junior linebacker Jawuan Johnson PERIOD

The offense returned the favor going up  with an overtheshoulder touchdown reception by junior wide receiver D.J PERIOD Brown which was the third of his career PERIOD

In the final seconds heading into the second quarter Johnson added a sack on Chippewas graduate quarterback Shane Morris to end the quarter PERIOD

Central Michigan found themselves down by even more after a 24yard field goal was made by senior kicker Christian Hagan resulting in the last time NIU would score until the fourth quarter PERIOD

MidAmerican Conference player of the year candidate Sutton Smith redshirt sophomore defensive end chipped in once again with his fourteenth sack of the season PERIOD

Heading into the half the Huskies had all the momentum and held the Chippewas to  yards on the ground and were up by a score of  PERIOD

The second half started with an eruption from Central Michigan with a 56yard touchdown catch by senior wide receiver Mark Chapman PERIOD

On the next Chippewas drive a 52yard run by sophomore running back Jonathan Ward set up a 23yard field goal by senior kicker Michael Armstrong to pull Central Michigan within seven PERIOD

Shortly after Chippewas sophomore cornerback Sean Bunting intercepted his seventh career pass and fifth in his last four games leading to a Ward touchdown reception tying the game at  PERIOD

After another run by Ward resulting in a score Central Michigan took its first lead of the day with  unanswered points PERIOD

The Huskies offense came back late in the fourth quarter with a 12yard touchdown score by redshirt freshman tailback Tre Harbison to tie the game PERIOD

With a fourth and four and just under  left in the game Morris connected on a 29yard touchdown reception by senior wide receiver Corey Willis to take the lead PERIOD

Morris is a great player Carey said PERIOD We didnt execute in the second half but you have to give Central Michigan credit because they are a very good football team. redshirt freshman quarterback Marcus Childers put together a fourth quarter drive with completions to Spencer Tears redshirt sophomore wide receiver and Chad Beebe redshirt senior wide receiver but the young Huskie quarterback threw another interception to the Chippewas a  victory PERIOD

Childers got hit as he was throwing it and it held up in the wind and Central Michigan made a good play on the ball Carey said PERIOD

With a University of Toledo Rockets win over the Western Michigan University Broncos and a Huskie loss Friday Toledo   MAC won the MAC West with the Huskies   MAC and Chippewas   MAC finishing second in the division PERIOD

The Huskies will now play the waiting game to see who they will match up against in this years upcoming bowl game as NIU will look to win its first bowl game since  when they defeated the Arkansas State Red Wolves  in the GoDaddy.com Bowl PERIOD
