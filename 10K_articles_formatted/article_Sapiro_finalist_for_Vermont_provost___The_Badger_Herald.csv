Sapiro the second highestranking administrator at UW is interviewing today with University of Vermont officials about their vacant provost position in Burlington Vt PERIOD

Her visit to Vermont comes just three weeks after a similar trip to the University of Kansas where Sapiro is also being considered for the vacant provost position PERIOD

 UVM Assistant Communications Director Jeff Wakefield said Monday PERIOD 

Despite holding the UW job on an interim basis UWs Search Committee for a New Provost left Sapiro off a list of finalists in late December PERIOD

Prior to her appointment as interim provost at Wisconsin last year Sapiro had also been a final candidate for provost at Michigan State University according to the MSU website PERIOD

In recent interviews Sapiro has avoided questions about her UW candidacy saying it would be inappropriate for her to comment on whether or not she applied for the job on a permanent basis PERIOD

Of the three finalists who were named for the open UW position only two remain after the University of Kentucky quickly claimed Kumble Subbaswamy as its new provost Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

While Sapiro is busy mingling with her potential future colleagues in Vermont UW officials are currently in between their own interview sessions with the two remaining candidates PERIOD

UW College of Engineering Associate Dean Patrick Farrell interviewed with UW officials just last week and Sue Rosser dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at the Georgia Institute of Technology will be in Madison at the end of this month for her own meetings PERIOD

Sapiro who has been a UW employee for the past  years said in a Jan PERIOD  interview a number of different universities have attempted to woo her away from Madison PERIOD

 Sapiro said PERIOD 

As of press time Sapiro could not be reached for further comment PERIOD

UW spokesperson John Lucas declined comment on Sapiros candidacy at UVM citing university policy regarding employees job searches PERIOD
