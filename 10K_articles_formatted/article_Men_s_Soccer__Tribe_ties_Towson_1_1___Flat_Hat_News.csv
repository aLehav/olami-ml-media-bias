8448,2023-11-05,"william and Mary   CAA waited through a twoday rainstorm to get back on the field against Towson so what would another  minutes matter

The Tribe tied Towson  after going into double overtime against Tigers at the Warhill Sports Complex Friday PERIOD The match which left the College  in the CAA standings was held at the Warhill complex due to heavy rainstorms over the past two days that made the surface at AlbertDaly Field unplayable PERIOD

I think in the end the draw was a fair result Head Coach Chris Norris said PERIOD We were a little disappointed obviously after scoring what I thought was a good goal early to give up a deflected goal PERIOD I thought we did a pretty good job dealing with those attacking players. sophomore midfielder Ben Anderson drew first blood in the match scoring on a header in he eleventh minute off a pass from senior defender Michael DiNuzzo from eight yards out for his first collegiate goal PERIOD Andersons goal was the culmination of an attack which started with a long cross from freshman forward Roshan Patel crossing the ball in front of the box PERIOD

DiNuzzo cleaned up the rebound from Patels cross and served the ball into the box where Anderson would head the shot into the top right corner of the box to make the score  PERIOD

They did a better job as the game wore on closing us down in midfield Norris said PERIOD The field today is a little bit smaller than what were used to PERIOD It is ten yards shorter six to eight yards narrower than what were used to PERIOD And that made a difference definitely. towson evened the contest in the thirtieth minute when forward Olakunle Banjo knocked in a deflection off Tribe senior goalkeeper Andrew McAdams to even the score at  PERIOD

With the exception of Banjos goal the College did a good job tracking back and defending against potent Towson attacks PERIOD

We had a specific job for senior back Nick Orozco today to really sit in and anchor our midfield PERIOD I thought he did a very good job in that Norris said PERIOD The players in the back did a good job as well. the Tribes best chance to pull ahead came in the second overtime with  remaining when senior midfielder Nat Baako found sophomore midfielder Caleb Thomas on the right side PERIOD Thomas settled the ball and ripped a shot on frame but the ball banged off the crossbar and went out of play PERIOD

With the tie with the No. in the South Atlantic Region Tigers the College moves to  in CAA play with their next match coming up at home versus Georgia State on Wednesday PERIOD
