I will be the first to admit to lightly joking around with my friends about mental illnesses in the past. sometimes phrases like dont be so depressed or stop acting like a crazy person slip out when youre not paying attention. but that doesnt make it okay PERIOD

A hot topic of discussion recently is the speculation around Amanda Bynes PERIOD

Bynes was a child actor and is most known for her acting in films such as Shes the Man and Easy A. recently Bynes was hospitalized in an involuntary psychiatric care unit and is said to suffer from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder PERIOD

Ive seen numerous posts on social media sites discussing Bynes condition and let me tell you none of them were very kind PERIOD

In August comedian and actor Robin Williams committed suicide PERIOD

It later came to surface that Williams had suffered from depression and that it was likely linked to his suicide PERIOD

Floods of people turned to social media to express how upset they were by the loss of Williams and how horrible it must be to suffer from depression PERIOD

These two examples may be different but in many ways they are similar. both celebrities suffer from a mental illness and mental illnesses are a serious condition PERIOD

Mourning over the loss of Williams and posting statuses on Facebook making fun of Bynes public outbursts make you nothing but a coward PERIOD

Think before you speak. consider what youre about to post online before typing it. i know its a radical idea but try to keep your opinions to yourself PERIOD

I believe that the situation Bynes and her family have been put in is incredibly saddening PERIOD

Not only do they have to live with trying to overcome mental illnesses in general but also they have to do it under the publics eye PERIOD

Many people may think of Bynes as an actress that has gone off the beaten path and shouldnt be allowed out in public but the fact of the matter is that she has every right to PERIOD

Those that suffer from mental illness are fully capable of functioning as someone who does not suffer from one. in fact many people you know are probably suffering and you have no idea PERIOD You probably walk right past those fighting mental illness on a daily basis and have no idea PERIOD

I can bet that you have a friend hat suffers from anxiety and panic attacks and I can bet that you dont even realize it PERIOD

You probably treat them like you treat all your other friends PERIOD

And thats how you should be treating the rest of society that suffers from mental illnesses famous or not PERIOD
