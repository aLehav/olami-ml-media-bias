Small island nations at risk of being wiped off the map by rising sea levels are leading the charge at COP21 for a global temperature target of just . degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels said Sarah Munro sustainability coordinator for the University of Connecticuts Office of Environmental Policy PERIOD

COP21 is the United Nations twenty-first Conference of the Parties an international meeting of experts and negotiators from more than  countries that have adopted the United Nations Framework on Climate Change since the Rio Earth Summit in  PERIOD

Official negotiations began in Paris Nov PERIOD  with the stated ambitions of revisiting plans to maintain global temperatures at no more than  degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels and to raise  billion toward mitigating the effects of climate change in developing countries PERIOD Negotiations are scheduled to end today Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

There was a huge amount of representation of indigenous groups and groups from island states that were presenting their platform to the general public said Munro who attended COP21 in Paris with a group of  UConn students earlier this month PERIOD They are the lowlying countries they dont want a flood. by the U.N.s High Commissioner of Refugees most conservative estimates inhospitable weather conditions and environmental degradation resulting from climate change are expected to displace at least  million people by  PERIOD

As of Thursday morning the Guardian reported that a high ambition coalition of more than  nations  including top greenhouse producers such as the United States Canada and the entire EU  have come out in favor of a legally binding agreement that would lower the acceptable standard of global warming by  from  degrees Celsius . degrees Fahrenheit to . degrees Celsius . degrees Fahrenheit PERIOD

Notably absent is support from representatives of China and India who have reportedly opposed stricter regulation of carbon dioxide emissions due to concerns that such limits would disproportionately impact developing economies PERIOD

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereported that global temperature increases must remain below  degrees Celsius to avoid the most extreme flooding drought and wildfires PERIOD Ronald Tardiff a seventhsemester marine science major who attended COP21 with the Office of Environmental Policy said even this best case scenario is not enough for many low lying countries PERIOD

There was a lot of talk about small island nations and how theyre going to be entirely lost even under the  degree scenario the world is working toward Tardiff said PERIOD When you lose these small island countries because theyre going to be flooded youre not just losing a village youre not just losing the people that live there but youre also losing the entire culture that might go back thousands of years so very literally climate change would be erasing evidence of human history. between  and  the United States produced  percent of global greenhouse gas emissions despite constituting less than  percent of the worlds population according to the World Resources Institute.Individually Americans were responsible for producing the equivalent of  metric tons of carbon dioxide in  over four times the global average which was roughly equivalent to the emissions of the average Brazilian or Mexican citizen PERIOD

Despite this unbalance the BBC reported discussions surrounding loss and damages the question of whether or not Western polluters should be required to compensate the global south for the destructive effects of climate change have been tense in the past PERIOD In  leaders of  developing nations walked out of negotiations during COP19 in Warsaw Poland when wealthier developed countries pushed discussions of compensation to  PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD is fighting hard to avoid paying damages even though we are responsible so we dont have to pay to relocate these people Tardiff said PERIOD

In addition to being one of the worlds leading producers of greenhouse gases the United States is also one of the only nations in the world where the reality of climate change is still up for debate PERIOD Tardiff said he thinks this is due to the success of the denial machine fueled by conservative politicians like Texas Sen PERIOD and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz who campaign on the idea that environmentalism is a ploy to expand big government PERIOD

Thats the kind of attitude that pretty much exclusively exist in the United States PERIOD In other countries youll have academics who say Its not going to happen that fast or economist who say Its not worth spending money on but you dont have people saying its not happening at all Tardiff said PERIOD Frankly the matter is that countries like China that decide to a adapt and switch over to clean energy soonest are going to have the best future advantages the U.S PERIOD is setting itself up for future failure. munro who studied for a year in Germany said she has observed a higher level of trust in science abroad leaving many confused as to how climate change still remains a controversy in the United States PERIOD

Even if you dont talk about the science I think theres a general culture thats very accepting of the need to reduce pollution the need to do things that have less of an impact on your environment Munro said adding that other countries may feel the effects of environmental degradation more acutely because their populations are more tightly packed PERIOD

Brianna Church a seventhsemester environmental engineering student and an Office of Environmental Policy intern said COP21 speakers from Libya and Uganda which are experiencing ongoing flooding and droughts highlighted how climate change continues to shape peoples everyday lives PERIOD

It really brought the issues a lot closer to home because especially in the northeast where we have abundant resources its easy to distance ourselves from these problems Church said PERIOD

Munro said students will continue to build on what they learned at COP21 next semester through panel discussions blogging and art including a photo exhibition by Church PERIOD

Our generation is pretty united in the fact that we all agree that climate change is real its happening and something needs to be done Church said PERIOD As a group we hope to carry forth the ideas that we learned at COP21. kimberly Armstrongis a staff writer for The Daily Campus PERIOD She can be reached via email at kimberly.armstronguconn.edu PERIOD
