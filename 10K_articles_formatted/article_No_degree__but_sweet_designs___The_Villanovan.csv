So youve decided on a career in fashion and Villanova does not have your major PERIOD Thinking about transferring Well not so fast PERIOD While Villanova may not have a Fashion Design or Fashion Merchandising major Villanova alum Lina PerezLammot class of  is making a name for herself in the fashion world after having graduated with a degree in Management and International Business PERIOD

Ive always had a passion for fashion PerezLammot said PERIOD However I started my career working for a traditional consulting company called Accenture. as secure as her job was it just wasnt what PerezLammot wanted PERIOD I had what a considered to be a fantastic position in a terrific team with enviable job flexibility PERIOD As secure as my job was though it wasnt leading me to my long term goals. perezLammot made a very tough decision and put aside her traditional career to dedicate herself to Zazii.com a fashion accessories website that provides fashion enthusiasts with access to the new Classic Collection and Enviable Collection of luxurious handbags says the April  press release PERIOD

So just how did PerezLammot break into the fashion industry without a classic major She attributes it partly to the fact that she was exposed to different cultures during her college years PERIOD

I am from Puerto Rico so coming to Villanova was like studying abroad for me she said PERIOD PerezLammot also had the chance to travel and study abroad in the Netherlands PERIOD I love traveling and being exposed to different cultures and customs and ideas PerezLammot said PERIOD After working for Accenture on the consulting side I transferred to the Diversity Team  a small team that is primarily responsible for the recruitment retention and advancement of minorities PERIOD I love the role the team and my exposure but I reached a plateau in my career and decided to start my own business. these experiences taught PerezLammot to experiment with different things while Villanova prepared her for running a business PERIOD Although Villanova did not prepare me for a career in the fashion industry it did provide me with the foundation that I needed to become a business woman she said PERIOD Fashion might be a sexy industry but at the end of the day it is still a business PERIOD I lead Zazii as such. as for Zazii PerezLammot and Pilar RodriguezBou  the companys Vice President and Chief Designer  see the company continuing to expand in the future PERIOD Zaziis mission is to become an internationally recognized brand of accessories PERIOD Most important to PerezLammot is continuing to provide customers with the highest level of service to satisfy their needs PERIOD

During the next couple of years the company will expand the collections into other womans accessories PERIOD In the meantime says PerezLammot the company will continue working on handbags perfecting the designs and finishes PERIOD

On a personal note I plan to utilize Zazii as a catalyst to inspire encourage and support other young female entrepreneurs PerezLammot said PERIOD I am looking forward to the small failures achieving big successes and always being open to the teachings of the school of life. your donation will support the student journalists of The Villanovan with technological needs training etc
