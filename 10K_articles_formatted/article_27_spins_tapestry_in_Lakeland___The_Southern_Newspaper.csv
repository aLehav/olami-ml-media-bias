The creative team at Twenty Seven Community is making a name for themselves here in Lakeland PERIOD The company specializes in reasonably priced handcrafted home decor PERIOD Art ranges from handmade prints to macrame and nokill cacti PERIOD

The team is composed of allfemale college students who specialize in different types of artwork PERIOD Business owner Jenna Cherry first came up with the company in August  PERIOD

The business came out of a season of depression and anxiety Cherry said PERIOD I figured the only thing that really helped me feel like myself again was making. after that the team of TSC quickly went to work holding creative meetings at night to discuss any new ideas they had PERIOD From that TSC launched its first online store for customers to enjoy their products PERIOD Cherry said the focus of the teams artwork is to bring sunshine to everyones homes PERIOD

Everything is handmade because that is what were passionate about Cherry said PERIOD We would honestly still be making art even if it wasnt for sale. cherry wants anyone who sees her business to understand that what we put in our homes really matters PERIOD A home is a space that can comfort people and make them feel safe when needed PERIOD TSC wants to help the best way they can with the process of making a home feel and look like a home PERIOD

Even on cloudy days we want our decor to remind them of sunshine Cherry said PERIOD

Kierra Hickombottom a junior at Florida Southern College reviewed TSCs website as inspiration for decorating her apartment next year PERIOD

I really like all the colors and simple prints that they have Hickombottom said PERIOD I would love to see what more they come up with PERIOD I would definitely shop their next popup shop. the hardest part for the TSC team would be finding time to create new decor PERIOD This is especially true for Cherry since she is a fulltime junior at Southeastern University PERIOD
However this wont stop the team from continuing to become a household name in Lakeland PERIOD

In five years Cherry hopes that she and the TSC team can keep growing in online sales and social media following along with more popup shops in a few new markets in central Florida PERIOD Cherrys dream is to own a brick and mortar store in downtown Lakeland for her customers to shop in PERIOD She also hopes that shell be able to support another startup business at the same time PERIOD

Id love a fairly big space and to pair up with a coffee startup Cherry said PERIOD That would be such a unique experience for Lakelanders to enjoy. to purchase art you can find them on their website at twentysevencommunity.com PERIOD You could also message their company on its personal Instagram twentysevencommunity PERIOD

Save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
