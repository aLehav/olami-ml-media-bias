In todays hookup culture finding love can be a challenge due to a lack of vulnerability with others PERIOD

However a recent study shows it is possible to create intimacy with a stranger by condensing months of getting to know someone into  questions followed by four minutes of staring into each others eyes PERIOD

According to the study by psychologist Arthur Aron and his wife Elaine Aron it was not created to intentionally make people fall in love but rather start friendships and relationships and get people to open up in a new way PERIOD

A blog post by Elaine Aron in the Huffington Post states that for the 36question study to make its participants fall in love they must go into it truly wanting love PERIOD

Drake students tested the theory themselves PERIOD With the questions ranging from basic to very personal from Who would you want as a dinner guest to Of all the people in your family whose death would be the most disturbing participating in the study was different than students had expected PERIOD

Sophomores Jeremy Price and Annie Snyder enjoyed their experience PERIOD

However they anticipated more surfacelevel questions before participating in the experiment PERIOD

The questions were a lot different than I thought they were going to be Snyder said. they were really deep at some points and wanted you to look very deep. price agreed that some of the questions were surprising PERIOD

It was like what was the worst memory of your life like what Price laughed PERIOD You dont just ask that to people you dont really know. before the study they thought it would be ridiculous PERIOD

By the end they saw how it could make people develop feelings for each other depending upon their answers PERIOD At the same time they realized how it could backfire PERIOD

I think it totally depends on what they say as far as answers go Price said PERIOD You could totally hate what they have to say or their personality PERIOD It can totally turn you off. however they felt conversing with a stranger made it easy for them to open up during some of the more personal questions PERIOD

I think it makes it easier with a stranger because you dont know their perceptions and how theyre going to feel about something Snyder said PERIOD

While Price and Snyder found it an interesting experience it would not be their choice of trying to get to know somebody PERIOD

At first it seems really unnatural because you dont usually have that conversation with someone you just met Price said PERIOD You get to know them over the months so its interesting. sophomore Michael Dolan and junior Shereen Hunitie also participated in the study PERIOD While overall they thought it was a fun experience they had some trouble answering some of the more personal questions truthfully PERIOD One of their main concerns is Drake being a small campus and the likelihood to run into each other PERIOD

If it was someone that I just met that I was never going to see again I would have maybe answered truthfully but Im probably going to see him all the time now Hunitie said PERIOD

Dolan agreed that the questions were interesting but some were too intense PERIOD

I think were going to pass each other look at each other and have a weird laugh and pass Dolan said PERIOD

While the study is meant to get to know another person deeply in a condensed time Hunitie thought it was an emotional experience as well PERIOD

I felt like it was a really emotionally charged experiment Hunitie said PERIOD Some of the questions brought up a lot of emotions so there was a lot going on at once. even so the two didnt want to burden the other with their own emotions or negative parts of their lives PERIOD

The last one where it asks if you have a current problem right now tell the person about it and they can help you with it Dolan said PERIOD Why do you want to put that burden on them and also how comfortable are you expressing that to someone you dont know. while Hunitie and Dolan thought answering the questions was interesting they thought the four minutes of eye contact was silly and pointless and later admitted to not being able to do it for the entire time PERIOD

The first two minutes were awkward because we kept laughing Dolan said PERIOD

In the end Hunitie thinks the experiment can benefit people who have an initial connection or attraction to each other PERIOD Dolan also believes it can help people who already have a relationship get to know each other on an even deeper level PERIOD

I think two people can have a lot of potential if theyre already pretty aligned in certain aspects and attracted to each other Hunities said PERIOD I think that with two opposite people its not going to happen but if theyre closer it can. jNews  Premium WordPress news  magazine theme by Jegtheme PERIOD
