Mathew Burrows counselor and director for the Analysis and Production Staff of the National Intelligence Council spoke to a packed room of Penn State students and visitors Thursday in the Reber Building about possible future scenarios the world may see in  PERIOD

Our mission has more or less stayed the same PERIOD The mission is unique in the world Burrows said PERIOD To look ahead in the world and look at trends critical to national intelligence. the Strategic and Global Security Program Engineering Leadership Development Minor and The School of International Affairs sponsored the presentation PERIOD

The NIC sits atop  intelligence agencies in the government and is located in the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters Burrows said PERIOD

He outlined three possible scenarios in his presentation that the NIC has been working on for their next report before taking questions from the audience PERIOD

It is not a set of predictions but a framework of how to think of future trends Burrows said PERIOD

The NIC looking at technology governance future of conflict and U.S PERIOD role tries to determine how global powers will interact PERIOD

The most likely scenario according to Burrows is a fragmentation of global powers and international cooperation as economic growth in other countries increases and slows in the U.S. leading to the U.S PERIOD falling behind PERIOD

The second scenario is a fusion between the powers in the West and East PERIOD While both parties would be considered a winner in this situation it would call on political leaders to cooperate and take risks toward global cooperation Burrows said PERIOD

The least likely scenario which Burrows called the nightmare scenario is the zero sum where the globe returns to a preglobalization mentality as protectionism grows and more conflicts occur PERIOD

Everyone are losers in this situation more or less Burrows said PERIOD

Penn State student Danny Kannell junioreconomics attended because he is interested in international situations that the NIC studies PERIOD

Im surprised that fragmentation is the biggest possible scenario against more fusion in the future Kannell said PERIOD

Burrows at the end said there are other important factors the U.S PERIOD needs to improve in the future PERIOD

There are bigger issues that we havent even begun to discuss like preserving our technology lead educational achievement and becoming more of an exporting country of high value goods Burrows said PERIOD

While some future outlooks look bleak for the U.S. Burrows said the U.S PERIOD is still seen as on top by many countries around the world PERIOD

The rest of the world still thinks we are sitting pretty including China Burrows said PERIOD
