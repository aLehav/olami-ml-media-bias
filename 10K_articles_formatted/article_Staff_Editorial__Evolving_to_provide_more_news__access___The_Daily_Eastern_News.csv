This past weekend several members of our editorial board attended the MidAmerica Press Institutes first workshop of the year Managing Change in St PERIOD Louis Mo PERIOD



The focus of the weekend was to bring professional as well as student journalists together to discuss how to do more with less in a changing news climate and how to bring innovation to the newsroom PERIOD

Members of the MidAmerica Press Institute a nonprofit association of news organizations shared how their newsrooms have changed and evolved in recent years some for the better some for the worst PERIOD

However a clear consensus that came through in the discussions is that journalism is not dying PERIOD

Its simply evolving PERIOD

Readers no longer receive their news from one source  they get it in print they get it through mobile apps and through social media PERIOD

And here at The News we need to evolve as well PERIOD This means youll be hearing a lot more from us beyond the page PERIOD

Socialmedia tools like Twitter and Facebook are often abused to simply post OMG Nicki Minaj is crazy. we are not here to refute or prove this statement the editorial board is split on this matter but instead we want to remind you how incredible these tools can be if we use them to their full potential PERIOD

And were going to do this PERIOD You will be able to access campus news from multiple channels  news will be more accessible through our Facebook and Twitter accounts and were going to take bigger strides with our online content PERIOD

This will also change the way we communicate with our online commentators but there will be more on this in the near future PERIOD

This also means you are going to here some new voices on our staff PERIOD Within the next two weeks several members of our staff are going to be launching new blogs to better reach out to our readers PERIOD

This will be a new way to get to know our reporters and editors that you would only normally see as a byline PERIOD Yes we report on events and issues on campus but would you ever know our Online Editor is a fantastic cook He absolutely is by the way. we leave ourselves out of our reporting to present the facts as unbiased and accurately as we can PERIOD Our blogs will give us a voice after you leave the page PERIOD

This change isnt going to happen overnight but we hope through your feedback through these multiple channels it will be worth the work PERIOD
