The New Mexico State football team wrapped up their regular season with a more than respectable  record after a  win over Valparaiso from the FCS division PERIOD Despite this finish to the season this Jerry Kill campaign sent an appeal to the NCAA in order to provide the team with bowl eligibility over teams with a  record since not being able to play the same amount of FBS opponents as other programs was no fault of their own PERIOD This request was later granted and the Aggies were pitted against Bowling Green in the Quick Lane Bowl PERIOD

NM State entered this matchup in Detroit Michigan with a career bowl record of  with three Sun Bowl appearances in   and  followed by an Arizona Bowl victory over Utah State in  that ended a 57year bowl drought PERIOD The  Quick Lane Bowl would become the thirteenth bowl game in Bowling Greens history ending a 7year drought and a chance to improve their  alltime bowl record PERIOD This game would also mark the first matchup between NMSU and Bowling Green in college football history along with Coach Jerry Kills sixth career bowl game as a head coach as Coach Kill looked to acquire his first career bowl game victory in his first season with the Aggies PERIOD

NMSUs defense came out with grit early in the game as senior linebacker Trevor Brohard intercepted a pass from Bowling Green quarterback Matt McDonald putting the Aggies in scoring position early PERIOD NM State then quickly capitalized on the turnover with a 70yard drive capped off by a 15yard passing touchdown from Diego Pavia to Star Thomas PERIOD The Bowling Green offense looked a bit more cohesive on their second drive but came away scoreless once again after a missed 48yard field goal PERIOD Following punts by both teams the Aggies would orchestrate a  play 80yard drive ending with a 2yard touchdown pass from Diego Pavia to Eric Marsh ending the half  PERIOD This was the first opening half shut out of the season for NM State against an FBS opponent PERIOD

Entering the second the Aggie offensive would quickly pick up right where they had left off putting together a seven play 57yard drive ending in a 35yard field goal by NMSU kicker Ethan Albertson PERIOD However this  lead did not last very long as Bowling Greens Taron Keith would take the ensuing kickoff back  yards for a touchdown bringing the Falcons back into the game with a score of  PERIOD Not soon after NM State would find the end zone yet again thanks to a Ahmonte Watkins 45yard touchdown run up the middle bumping the lead to  PERIOD

Bowling Green brought a head of steam into the fourth quarter orchestrating a drive within the NMSU 20yard line after forcing a punt PERIOD This drive would come to a screeching halt however as Aggie linebacker Chris Ojoh would force a fumble on Bowling Green at the NMSU three yard line and have it recovered by cornerback Syrus Stitch Dumas ending the Falcons drive PERIOD A forced NM State punt from their own end zone resulting in a block and conversion into a safety and change of possession would add a glimmer for Bowling green PERIOD The Falcons would then find the end zone after a Jhaylin Embry 33yard kick return and three plays but it would prove too late a comeback PERIOD

This Jerry Kill squad would leave Ford Field as the Quick Lane Bowl victors with a score of  marking the second bowl game win for the Aggies in  years along with the first bowl victory for Coach Kill PERIOD Diego Pavia was honored as the Player of the Game as he tallied  passing yards with  touchdowns along with  rushing yards and a single interception PERIOD

Well its probably like game four or five I realized I didnt like where I was at PERIOD I didnt like where I was at this time mentally physically and so really it was just pulling myself together getting everything right trusting the person next to me and once I did that I felt like it would do anything PERIOD It was really just the connection between me and the receivers Pavia remarked PERIOD Our defense played a hell of a game tonight and our offense played great too just upfront they just did a tremendous job PERIOD Defense made huge plays every single time we needed the so really when that happens anythings possible PERIOD Ive just got to do my job. coach Kill and the Aggies will head into next season with a new found fire after such a performance PERIOD Finishing the season with a  overall record in the first year of the Kill Era the future looks incredibly bright for the New Mexico State football team PERIOD The sky is seemingly the limit and we can all look forward to the start of next season in  as the Aggies will make their Conference USA debut after playing as Independents for the past  seasons PERIOD
