One less struggle for parents and kids with diabetes

ARA  It can be a real tug of war the struggles parents face
when they have to give their child medicine PERIOD As hard as that is
just try to imagine what its like for the parent of a child with
diabetes and getting that child to test hisher blood sugar several
times a day PERIOD For a child with a chronic disease like type 
diabetes  in which the body does not produce insulin  daily
insulin shots are just the tip of the iceberg living with diabetes
also involves constant testing of blood glucose sugar PERIOD For some
children who are diagnosed with diabetes at a very young age
regular monitoring becomes a habit early on PERIOD For children who are
diagnosed between ages  and  however the habit may be harder
to instill and blood sugar monitoring may be seen as a chore to
avoid at all costs PERIOD

For most kids with diabetes the entire process of blood sugar
testing  pricking a finger several times a day being forced to
carry testing supplies everywhere having to interrupt playing with
friends or doing other normal kid activities  is one giant
intrusion in their life PERIOD Often they grow more and more resentful
of their parents constant reminders to test their blood sugar PERIOD
Despite lectures arguments and their parents pleas to take
monitoring seriously some kids may come up with excuse after
excuse to get around testing PERIOD

 says Dr PERIOD Larry Deeb pediatric endocrinologist
and medical director for the Diabetes Center at Tallahassee
Memorial Hospital in Florida PERIOD 

A new blood glucose monitor is aimed at getting kids interested
in managing their diabetes by linking it to activities that a child
understands and enjoys PERIOD The DIDGET meter developed by Bayer
Diabetes Care taps into kids passion for handheld video games PERIOD
The DIDGET meter connects to Nintendo DS and DS Lite gaming
systems rewarding kids through points and unlocked levels on a
variety of adventure games and minigame arcades PERIOD The meter also
connects to DidgetWorld a special Web community where kids can
spend points that they earn from good testing practices and
customize their own page PERIOD

 adds Deeb PERIOD 

Successful diabetes management requires a lifetime commitment of
eating healthy and staying active monitoring blood sugar levels
working to prevent any serious complications and following
prescribed treatment and HCP recommendations PERIOD As kids move from one
stage to the next the good habits formed during childhood lay the
foundation of success PERIOD Collegebound teens and young adults can
continue to stay on top of their diabetes monitoring with the help
of another blood glucose monitor Bayers CONTOUR USB meter PERIOD The
CONTOUR USB meter uses the same CONTOUR testing strips and plugs
into a PC or Mac and provides alerts and test reminders so
