AVA KIAN Hi everyone Im Ava Kian PERIOD

YOKO VUE Im Yoko Vue and youre listening to In the Know a podcast by the Minnesota Daily PERIOD

KIAN Last March businesses schools and other establishments in the United States shut down inperson functions and people began to quarantine from their loved ones PERIOD Ten months later some people are still taking COVID19 precautions but are now seeing pods of trusted friends and family more frequently PERIOD We were curious to see what students are doing with their pods and what is holding their relationships together PERIOD

I spoke with Kyle Hoang a secondyear business student at the University of Minnesota who recalls how he felt seeing people in person at the beginning of the pandemic PERIOD

KYLE HOANG When the pandemic first started I was very strict about it PERIOD And I was the one who would tell people not to hang out PERIOD And I myself would not hang out PERIOD I would stay in my room all day PERIOD

KIAN More recently however Kyle has started seeing his close group of friends PERIOD He says he sees them on the condition that they are all a closed pod PERIOD

HOANG These were like the first few friends that I have met at the U that I was able to be really close with PERIOD  Before the pandemic I met them in person and everything PERIOD Like we established that friendship in person but we spend our friendship more online than in person PERIOD

I remember when we first hung out  like the first time we decided to hang out  we were also nervous because  we all had like high expectations and  some sort of guilt came over all of us so we would all still wear a mask even when we hang out PERIOD

KIAN Over time the group became more comfortable taking off masks PERIOD To be extra cautious Kyle and his friends take precautions before seeing their families PERIOD

HOANG Last semester I didnt see my family at all PERIOD  And so this semester is probably going to be the same PERIOD  If I do go back it does make it complicated PERIOD I do try to wait it out for a few days before I decide to go back and see if I develop any symptoms PERIOD

KIAN Having gone through isolation and now heavy usage of technology for school and socialization Kyle wants more interactions away from the screens PERIOD

HOANG I think personally my mental health has gotten really bad back when I was still isolating PERIOD  I feel like nowadays the activities that I do with my friends are less wholesome PERIOD

I have gotten sick of Zoom like study sessions PERIOD Zoom fatigue happens even when its still friends PERIOD I think its just some type of association I made in my brain PERIOD But I really hate zoom PERIOD

Because every time I go on there I wouldnt be productive and I would get grumpy and stuff PERIOD  Its just not a good thing PERIOD Like thats not how I want to see my friends PERIOD

KIAN At the height of the pandemic Kyle and his friends would watch movies or shows online or study together on Zoom PERIOD What bonds them Kyle says is studying PERIOD Having gotten used to online hangouts seeing friends in person feels formal and unexciting at times PERIOD

HOANG I dont see them often PERIOD Recently I do hang out with them but its more like I have to go out of my way to plan for it PERIOD Like Oh whats your GCal what  blah blah blah blah. and then its like an invitation PERIOD It feels like an invitation to a party or something PERIOD Its an extra step I have to do PERIOD So I dont hang out with them that often PERIOD I still study with them online almost every night PERIOD  It used to be a lot more spontaneous PERIOD

KIAN Though Zoom and inperson hangs have their ups and downs Kyle says hes still able to maintain his friendships PERIOD

HOANG We dont always have video calls or video chats PERIOD We would message each other and update us about any of our days PERIOD If we have a bad day we tend to share it or rant it to our group chat PERIOD  It still feels like a bit less than inperson experiences but we still care for each other PERIOD I think technology does  it doesnt help us get the full friendship experience but it does keep us there PERIOD

KIAN Kyle is looking forward to doing wholesome and fulfilling activities with his pod like learning to knit PERIOD

HOANG I just know knitting seems really cool PERIOD I get to wear what I make PERIOD

We have also compiled started to compile a list of TikToks that we can do together as a group for either when were in person or for when were in different parts of the city PERIOD

I want to go to a lake with one of my friends and not to just swim just to chill on the grass and have a picnic PERIOD And talk as if its not just like a catchup but like talktalk PERIOD

VUE Many folks miss the summer weather when we could socially distance ourselves while meeting up at a park or lake PERIOD During these winter months though movie nights have been a staple for Isabella Kemling whos majoring in mechanical engineering and Spanish PERIOD

ISABELLA KEMLING I spent a lot of my time with my roommates we do a lot of like movie nights little Bachelorette nights there PERIOD Then Im also dating someone PERIOD So I spend a good amount of time with them and their roommates too PERIOD Those are kind of my main social circles that Im seeing in person PERIOD

VUE In addition to watching reality TV shows cooking has been a bonding experience PERIOD Almost every Friday Isabella is baking with her roommates PERIOD

KEMLING One of my favorite moments is right before Halloween we all made like an apple pie and cut out little shapes out of different kinds of pie crust PERIOD So we have the jackolanterns and ghosts and stuff on there PERIOD That was kind of fun PERIOD We also do a lot of cookies with our baking too PERIOD One of my roommates is very into like cookies and cupcakes and cupcake decorating so weve done a few different themes for that or different kinds of decorations and things like that PERIOD

VUE While these relaxing activities can be fun Isabella said taking precautions with COVID does put on more stress PERIOD

KEMLING I would say Ive definitely been a little bit more anxious overall during this time just with like I said its always kind of an extra factor when Im choosing if I want to like accept plans or go do something with people of like what are the repercussions on me and my family or my roommates and their family So I would say thats been something thats kind of at least always a little bit on my mind that wasnt there before its been causing some stress PERIOD

VUE Safety is very important but Isabella said it can be tricky to put her foot down at times PERIOD

KEMLING I dont feel comfortable seeing people if theyve been going out I dont know to large gatherings or bars when bars were open or restaurants a lot and things like that PERIOD Um and so I know Ive struggled a little bit with like social repercussions of that sort of having to say Oh no I dont want to see you for  days or  days or like Can you please get a COVID test or things like that PERIOD

VUE For the friends she cant see in person Isabella keeps up with them over video chat PERIOD

KEMLING But with people Im not seeing I think its a little bit harder to stay in touch without putting in like a really intentional effort to PERIOD I know theres certain people that I used to see at least like once or twice a week wed go grab dinner or something like that and so kind of friends like that PERIOD Its definitely at least for me Ive been working a lot on being more intentional of reaching out to people like that and seeing how they are PERIOD

VUE This also includes family members that she hasnt been able to see in person PERIOD

KEMLING I would say its been really nice in some ways to have more video calls with people and even I dont know my familys been getting like my cousins and my grandma like used to Zoom so we can all kind of stay in touch with people like that who might not be safe to see PERIOD So I think thats been really really helpful for sure PERIOD

NAT SOUND TRANSITIONAL FADE UP AND UNDER TRACK BELOW

VUE For secondyear student Roselin Victor technology was a big part of keeping her friendships at the beginning of the pandemic PERIOD

ROSELIN VICTOR I found like a group of friends my second semester of freshman year which Im really thankful for PERIOD We were able to maintain the group like over quarantine at the beginning of  and over the summer and stuff PERIOD So Ive been talking to them for most of quarantine PERIOD

VUE Roselin is living offcampus with her family this year after breaking her lease on campus in the fall due to COVID concerns PERIOD

VICTOR Obviously with social media and stuff people portray their best selves online PERIOD And so its hard to see people partying and all of that during a pandemic when youre stuck at home with your parents and stuff PERIOD

VUE She said that with COVID technology is a doubleedged sword when it comes to feeling connected PERIOD

VICTOR I think its helped people stay connected because a lot of like  theres like people that you would say hi to like on campus but like you dont like FaceTime so its been good to like maintain that by like sending each other TikToks or whatever like small things like that PERIOD

VUE Roselin joined the Indian Student Association last March and through Zoom she was able to stay close to the members and the group was able to hold their events virtually PERIOD

VICTOR It was kind of stressful at the beginning because obviously we had no idea what was going to happen with COVID and when it was going to end and if we can even do anything virtually but I think we handled it pretty well PERIOD We tried to stay engaged on social media PERIOD We tried having like we had a virtual fall show which was like a YouTube live stream which went pretty well PERIOD It was just kind of hard to have engagement but I think we did the best to our ability PERIOD

VUE While it was warm in the fall Roselin and her friends would study outside PERIOD But after breaking her lease she hasnt been on campus as frequently and instead is hanging out with her friends mainly with Facetime and group chats PERIOD

VICTOR Well usually what happens is we were just talking about our days or like if something dramatic happens talking about that PERIOD For ISA we have board bonding sometimes where we play games or we just honestly talk about life and like school and show ugly pictures of ourselves from when we were little and things like that PERIOD

VUE A unique way Roselin maintains her friendships is by running errands with friends in a COVID safe way PERIOD

VICTOR One of my friends Srilekha shes actually the president of ISA PERIOD She lives like  minutes away from me and we started going to the grocery store together because like were both going to go to the grocery store anyways PERIOD So its not that big of a risk PERIOD

KIAN Were in a really weird time PERIOD Most students are busy with online school and are doing their best to keep up with their friendships PERIOD Not everyone is comfortable seeing their friends in person PERIOD Those who do that weve spoken with take precautions by only visiting a pod of friends and getting tested before seeing others outside the group PERIOD Though the winter can be hard these students are looking forward to having inperson student group events less screen time and more socially distanced hangouts outside once the weather gets better PERIOD
