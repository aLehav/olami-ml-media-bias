9284,2023-11-04,"sometimes people try to shuffle past me eyes downcast PERIOD Sometimes they mutter something in response to my have a nice day. other times they take off running before I can finish an excuse me. im the gatekeeper PERIOD Im the bad guy PERIOD Im the card swiper at Uppercrust PERIOD

The job is rote PERIOD I smile at people who walk in swipe their ID cards through our machine and stare at the wall where a plaque proclaims students are permitted to remove from the Dining Room two cookies one piece of fruit or one ice cream treat. enforcing that plaque is the worst part of my job PERIOD Ive lost count of the students Ive watched stick sandwiches in CUPPS mugs or large bags of cereal in their backpacks PERIOD I cant remember how many classmates Ive asked to put back one of the three pieces of fruit theyre trying to sneak out PERIOD And thats only the people I catch PERIOD

Calvin students have sticky fingers PERIOD At the end of the year when students move out of the dorms cardboard boxes collect dozens of plates and cups that have found their way out of the dining halls and into dorm rooms PERIOD Students brag about the food theyve snuck out of Commons and Knollcrest PERIOD But I wonder if they realize what theyre doing PERIOD

The dining halls Johnnys and food courts at Calvin are operated by contract PERIOD The dining halls are a separate forprofit business that provides a service that we pay for PERIOD They work closely with Calvin but common objections like I pay enough in tuition dont apply because were not paying our tuition to the dining halls PERIOD

Lindsey Cato the service manager at Commons deals with theft constantly PERIOD If we let every student take an extra meal she said Or even an extra popsicle with them we would have to almost double our budget which cant be done without raising prices for meal plans PERIOD Taking that extra popsicle might not seem like a big deal but its plain and simple stealing. were a Christian school PERIOD So Im frustrated when the people I sit next to in chapel ignore rules and RAs and spiritual leaders brag about what theyve sneaked out PERIOD On a campus where many people care about holiness the dining halls seem to be a curious blind spot PERIOD Yet every square inch certainly extends to Uppercrust PERIOD If were really here on this earth to be representatives of Christ then we dont get a lunch break PERIOD

Dining hall workers comment on the striking kindness of Calvin students PERIOD What if they noticed too a striking honesty Students may be able to shuffle past me PERIOD An extra popsicle may be no big deal. but what is a big deal is compromising what you believe for an extra snack PERIOD If on my shift I didnt have to be vigilant or look suspiciously at each bulging backpack I think wed be on to something radical PERIOD
