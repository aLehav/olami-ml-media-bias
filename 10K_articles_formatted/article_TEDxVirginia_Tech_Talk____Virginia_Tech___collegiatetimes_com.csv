Last Saturday the Holtzman Alumni Center hosted the first ever TEDxVirginia Tech an event that featured  speakers who each gave their own take on the theme  From  A.M PERIOD to  P.M. speakers of all different ages races and backgrounds discussed their discoveries insight and personal philosophies related to that theme PERIOD According to Vice President Emeritus and MC of the TEDx event Edward F.D PERIOD Spencer the theme was intentionally broad to allow for a wide range of possible interpretations. the TEDxVirginia Tech event was inspired by the larger more international 

The nonprofit organization  stands for Technology Entertainment and Design and since its creation in  TED has been devoted to the phrase  Every summer in Scotland and every spring in Long Beach and Palm Springs TED invites professionals from all over the world to attend their conference and challenge them to give  in  minutes or fewer PERIOD

While TED originally stood for Technology Entertainment and Design its scope has greatly expanded allowing anything from a discussion of the American public school system to the secrets behind motivation PERIOD These talks use of brevity use of nontechnical language and very wellrehearsed presentations combine to make points that are both insightful and easily accessible PERIOD

Because the global talks have become so popular TED has encouraged  talks which focus on similar goals but on a more local scale PERIOD As these local events grew in popularity they caught the attention of Peter Doolittle and Eddie Watson leaders of CIDER the Center for Instructional Development and Educational Research PERIOD As Watson and Doolittle planned the event they were frequently meeting with Adam Soccolich the chief staff assistant of ICAT the Institute for Creativity Arts and Technology PERIOD

According to Soccolich  he said PERIOD



When a job offer elsewhere called Watson away from the event he offered the opportunity of operations manager for the event to Soccolich who took it PERIOD From there Soccolich and his team finished the rest of the planning and details for the event alongside cochair and Director of Marketing Melissa Richards PERIOD

When the first call for speakers was announced TEDxVirginia Techs  received hundreds of written proposals for talks and spent months narrowing the potential list of speakers to  Tech students alumni and faculty PERIOD

 said Soccolich 

Despite the small number of speakers the steering committee was able to ensure a wide variety of content among them PERIOD

During the first section of presentations an associate professors talk about how nanotechnology will improve the sustainability of the worldwide water supply was immediately followed by a grad students talk on how the lessons hes learned from improv classes have helped him grow as a person PERIOD

The conference room in which the event was held had a seating capacity of only  which led to tickets selling out quickly and the audience being largely made up of close friends and family of the speakers PERIOD However the small venue did little to dissuade prospective audience members PERIOD

Because the event was being recorded TEDxVirginia Tech worked to set up nearly a dozen streaming locations around the Tech campus as well as a location in Christchurch New Zealand where students could come and listen to the talks as they pleased PERIOD

While TEDxVirginia Tech asked a lot of its staff members like recent Virginia Tech alumnus Alex Obenauer were pleased to be there PERIOD

 said Obenauer PERIOD 

The staffs enthusiasm transferred over to the speakers as well PERIOD Fish and Wildlife faculty member Dr PERIOD Kathleen Alexander said 

Even after an event as successful as this one Adam Soccolich remains full of ideas for next year PERIOD

 said Soccolich PERIOD
