6265,2021-10-08,"a cup of coffee every morning PERIOD Her favorite bed sheets PERIOD Some wine that a friend gave her for her twenty-first birthday PERIOD The small material things in senior Rachel Youngs life manifest as preciousness in the art that she makes PERIOD

Devin Ball Digging for Gold Hellebore Ive held onto for too long coffee grounds I wouldnt let you throw away wood we found on Whidbey Island your face PERIOD

An official class for just a handful of years now professor Francisco Guerreros Advanced Studio Art Course culminates with an exhibit in an on campus gallery PERIOD But its course is not about spending a quarter trying to finish one piece to present at the end instead its about producing as much art as possible without rules themes or guidelines PERIOD The intention is for students to develop a process of creation not just a product PERIOD

Im trying to help you design how you work as opposed to help you make one object Guerrero said PERIOD

The idea here is that if students develop a process and a willingness to make art they will be able to continue that process outside of college where they wont have the same kind of structure universities offer PERIOD According to Young its a class that forces students into freedom PERIOD

Of course with the focus on productivity and quantity of output there also develops a tension between the concepts behind the art and the materials used to portray them PERIOD With really expensive products there is more pressure to not screw up PERIOD Looking around the gallery at this years show the art varies from paintings on canvases to arrangements of hair to simple materials like coffee grounds and pillowcases PERIOD

Several of the students chose to use materials that were not expensive but were precious to them PERIOD Young produced a series of embroidered fabrics and to see them is to know that they are special PERIOD But why What becomes apparent in Youngs work is that there is more to it than just thread and fabric PERIOD Young used artifacts from her life  to fill the physical art with the concepts and meanings behind its creation like preciousness and femininity PERIOD

She used special wines and teas as dyes PERIOD She used her own bed sheets and tshirts as the fabrics PERIOD The viewer cant name what makes it special but they can tell that it is PERIOD

It gave me a certain reverence towards the pieces that maybe I think they wouldnt have taken on if Id bought some really nice cloth from the store or something Young said PERIOD I think it really changed how I worked with it and then made the pieces themselves a lot better. senior mechanical engineering major Devin Ball also used precious material from his life to create his art PERIOD His work sometimes falls under the umbrella term of mixedmedia but to him that diminishes a lot of what hes trying to do PERIOD

What I use is a large part of what I think Im doing Ball said PERIOD And thats kind of like enshrining experiences that Ive had and these objects that Ive encountered while having those experiences. both Ball and Young just finished taking the class for a second time an option available because of the class nature PERIOD Both of them are continuing the work that they began in their first time through the course PERIOD For Ball one of those things is more deeply exploring the tension between preserving something and the knowledge that by trying to preserve something you are fundamentally changing it PERIOD

All of his materials are artifacts from his life PERIOD They are things that mean something to him and only him PERIOD At the same time however the viewer can see the work and know that even though they personally have no connection to the materials they are deeply precious PERIOD

Balls entire artist statement is a quote from F PERIOD Scott Fitzgerald PERIOD  It says Im not sentimentalIm as romantic as you are PERIOD  The idea you know is that the sentimental person thinks things will lastthe romantic person has a desperate confidence that they wont. despite the preciousness of the chosen materials the conceptual meaning behind them is part of what gives the students the freedom
to create PERIOD

I think some people kind of get stuck in this rut of setting out on this really ambitious thing that they spend a lot of time on and they miss out on a lot of experimentation that I think is really important when youre trying to establish an art practice Ball said PERIOD
This is what the course does for many studentsit gives them an outlet to create without consequence and develop the skills they need to be artists outside of Seattle U PERIOD The Advanced Studio Art Exhibit will be available for viewing until April  and is open to students in the Vachon Gallery in the Fine Arts Building PERIOD
