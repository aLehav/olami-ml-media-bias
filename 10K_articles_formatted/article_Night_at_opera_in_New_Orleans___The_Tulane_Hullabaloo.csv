Holly Haney Arcade EditorFebruary  

In the information session before the concert began the presenter said how during their most recent student night one of them had asked if opera was just all about love In many ways this student was absolutely correct PERIOD

From the moment we walked into the Mahalia Jackson Theater the Gala Concert put on by the New Orleans Opera Association showed clear signs of being a labor of love PERIOD This concert was the first performance from the New Orleans Opera Association since the COVID19 pandemic hit and the excitement was tangible PERIOD Backstage before the show the chorus members were chatting excitedly about the show PERIOD One member Shirley Stewart had been performing with the NOOA for over  years PERIOD

The NOOA General and Artistic Director Clare Burovac was set to host that evening but was unable to attend PERIOD Luckily her husband Christopher Mattaliano was able to fill in PERIOD Every time he spoke of his wife and her love for the organization he beamed with such joy for her and the art it was infectious PERIOD

One of the soloists John Moore who performed an electric rendition of the iconic Largo al factotum was a New Orleans native who had been performing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the past two years PERIOD However that same sense of love which bound together the chorus and Clare Burovac and her husband drew the tenor soloist back PERIOD

Though one might believe that opera is this stuffy exclusive and inaccessible art form the NOOA makes sure to share the love with as many people as possible PERIOD I was concerned that I wouldnt have a clue what was going on during the performances PERIOD But above the stage they hung a projector screen which displayed the context for each song as well as English translations of the music PERIOD

Admittedly I have never been to the opera or anything adjacent to it before so I had no idea what to expect PERIOD When I tell you the performances were nothing short of incredible I mean it PERIOD The sheer talent energy and presence each soloist and chorus member had kept my eyes and attention glued to the stage during the entire 90minute concert PERIOD I was so moved by each and every performance laughing and crying along with the music PERIOD Even if the songs were in another language every emotion was still clearly understood and felt PERIOD

When the curtains fell and the confetti cannon burst in the crowd  yes there was a confetti cannon  I could still feel that same sense of love PERIOD

If you want a night at the opera youre in luck PERIOD The NOOA has two upcoming performances this semester of Puccinis La bohme on April  and  at the Mahalia Jackson Theater PERIOD
