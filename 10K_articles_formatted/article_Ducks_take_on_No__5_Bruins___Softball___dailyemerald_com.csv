7639,1970-01-01,"another week another top10 team PERIOD

For the third straight series the No PERIOD  Oregon Ducks will match up with another highly ranked conference opponent as they travel to No PERIOD  UCLA Friday afternoon PERIOD

The Ducks have dropped four of their last six outings after going  with both No PERIOD  Washington and No PERIOD  Arizona State over the last two weeks and they will have their hands full yet again this weekend in Los Angeles PERIOD

What weve got to do this week is make sure we get to the fundamentals Oregon head coach Mike White said PERIOD Make sure we get strikes to swing at and that were being aggressive and we play errorfree ball PERIOD If we can do that I think well be in the games. oregon   Pacific10 Conference hasnt beaten the Bruins since the  season when it took all three games from a UCLA squad that was ranked in the top  throughout that year PERIOD Since then UCLA has taken  straight conference games from Oregon outscoring the Ducks by a margin of  during those meetings PERIOD

The Ducks offense is far more potent this season than in recent history but the Ducks will need to get on the board early PERIOD The Bruins have outscored their opponents  in the first three innings this year PERIOD

Theyre definitely a good team and they work hard Oregon senior center fielder Neena Bryant said PERIOD So it can be intimidating at some points. bryant recorded her fifth home run of the season last weekend tallying three hits and one RBI with two runs scored during the series PERIOD The season has been up and down for Bryant overall after hitting well over . her first three years at Oregon PERIOD Shes seen that number drop to . in  PERIOD

Sophomore shortstop Kelsey Chambers is coming off another big weekend for Oregon after banging out six hits in her eight atbats with one home run and three RBI PERIOD The Ducks leading hitter freshman Samantha Pappas struggled however going just  for  from the plate with no RBI against ASU PERIOD

Last weekend our discipline wasnt great on the road White said PERIOD we were swinging at a lot of pitches that we expanded the strike zone. pappas does still lead the team in hits  home runs  RBI  and walks  while her teamhigh . batting average is good enough for fifth in the Pac10 PERIOD

UCLA star Megan Langenfeld has torn through the conference with a leagueleading . average on the year PERIOD Langenfeld has not only gotten it done at the plate  ranking third in the conference with  home runs  but also from inside the pitching circle PERIOD

Langenfelds . eRA this season ranks second only to her teammate Aleah Macons mark of . pERIOD Going  in her limited action this season Langenfeld has struck out  and walked nine in her  innings pitched PERIOD Macon  has fanned  batters in just over  innings of work PERIOD UCLAs Donna Kerr is actually the ace of the staff with a  record this season throwing  complete games six of which were shutouts PERIOD

Having played with Langenfeld on a traveling team before high school Bryant said she could already see the strong work ethic at a young age PERIOD

Shes definitely one of those workhorses. bryant said PERIOD Shes really focused PERIOD Shes just really dedicated to the game and its just something you can respect out of her. white doesnt plan on taking too many chances against Langenfeld saying that if the situation calls for it the Ducks will make someone else beat us. looking ahead Oregon will host Portland State in a doubleheader next Wednesday in its final nonconference match up of the year before hosting No PERIOD  Arizona that weekend PERIOD

After that the Ducks will have only one series left at Stanford before learning their

postseason fate PERIOD

Were in good position. white said PERIOD Were in the third spot and if we can win this series here and then actually win all three series out I think well probably end up in the top three  which would be fantastic. lclarkdailyemerald.com
