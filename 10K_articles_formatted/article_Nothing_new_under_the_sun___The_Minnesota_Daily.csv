If youre going to name your new band after an immense star that reaches on average highs in the upper  million degrees its a must that said band has got a lot of explaining to do right off the bat PERIOD Compound that astounding level of pretentiousness with christening your debut EP Love and Death two of our humble planets most debated subjects ever and you have a cataclysm of posturing and selfaggrandizement in the making PERIOD

Recently formed in Columbus Ohio and featuring the exdrummer of seminal punk outfit New Bomb Turks The Suns Love And Death CD provides 800pound gorilla AOLTime Warner with the overproduced faux garage rock the marketplace is apparently still clamoring for PERIOD The hilariously derivative opening track Fell So Hard dreams so badly to be the White Stripes you can almost taste it PERIOD

Aside from the tastefully leftfield implementation of a Dr PERIOD Drestyle funk organ on Rockstop the seventeenminute disc does not cover any aural territory that has not already been flogged to death by the Vines the Hives and others PERIOD Perhaps the only minor detail worth discussing at length is Back in the Summer of . the tune itself is trivial at best but it perfectly encapsulates the nonsensical neogarage movement whose bedraggled coattails the band is obviously riding PERIOD

Judging from a summary glance at the inset band photo one could confidently wager front man Chris Burney wasnt even a drunken lustful glimmer in his fathers eye  years ago PERIOD How on Gods green earth can The Sun be heartbreakingly nostalgic for a time and place they never experienced the first time around It is all too eerily similar to the recent mid1990s swing comeback when disaffected dotcom billionaires copped mangled James Cagney accents sported neon orange zoot suits sucked on overpriced cigars and acted as if Prohibition was a cool time to be alive PERIOD Nothing to see here folks PERIOD Please move along PERIOD
