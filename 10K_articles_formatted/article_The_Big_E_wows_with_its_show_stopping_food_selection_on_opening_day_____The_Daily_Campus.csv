7005,2023-11-03,"i did the most aggressive return to American cuisine that was available to me at the time Consuming as much of it as I could at an American fair PERIOD More specifically The Big E PERIOD

I recently just returned home from being abroad for seven months PERIOD There are definitely some traditional American foods that Ive seen advertised in restaurants from New Zealand Vietnam Bali and more PERIOD As much as I had the occasional craving for a traditional American meal it doesnt get any more American than eating the food in the country PERIOD

Upon my return to the States I did the most aggressive return to American cuisine that was available to me at the timeConsuming as much of it as I could at an American fair PERIOD More specifically The Big E PERIOD Its known as New Englands Great StateFair. the opening day happened to be on one of the supposedly spookiest days of the year besides Halloween Friday the thirteenth PERIOD The only scarythingwas the amount of food that I consumed PERIOD

Here are the foods that I ate some reminiscingonmy American childhood and my ranking of the foods that the vendors at The Big E had to offer



But this potato on its own with none of the toppings was moist and did not have the slightly earthy taste that I was expecting PERIOD

Billies Baked Potato

To balance out the sweetness of what I had and in true fair fashion I had to start off with one of the most classic carb offerings of them all PERIOD Nowhere will you get something more wholesome and filling than a baked potato PERIOD The potatoes must be taken from a really special place because the tender inside was just right PERIOD Potatoes themselves or at least the ones Ive had dont reallyhave that much flavor ontheirown unlesstheyretossed with a whole bunch of seasonings PERIOD But this potato on its own with noneof the toppingswasmoist and did not have the slightly earthy taste that I was expecting PERIOD It was almost as if Mother Nature decided to simply take out the effort of making mashing potatoes and encased it all ready to go within this package PERIOD I opted for the vegetarian with melted cheese PERIOD Life is about balance and veggies on top of a big steaming potatowith some dairy for bone healthsounds like a good idea to me PERIOD The veggies themselves seemed as if they were steamed PERIOD I would have rather had them fried up because I wasnt such a big fan of the extra mush factor PERIOD However texture aside the simple flavors of this baked potato was worth it PERIOD

Honorary Mention Butter cow

Listen theres a reason why butter tastes really good PERIOD The huge butter cow that was being carved in the 4H section of the grounds probably would have tasted amazing PERIOD

Rating Off the charts



Flavorwise the chocolate drink was not too overpowering and was perfect to wash down the potato I inhaled earlier PERIOD

Dairy Bar

I was more excited to take a photo in front of their sign because its been a long time since Ive been to the Dairy Bar at the University of Connecticut PERIOD Nostalgia aside I wasalsoexcited about the . drink offering PERIOD No it wasnt buy one get onefreetequila shots PERIOD Rather it was . for your choice of a chocolate vanilla or strawberry shake PERIOD I had a theme to stick to so chocolate it was PERIOD I love a good milkshake but if youre looking for a thick shake mixed in with scoops of ice cream this isnt it PERIOD The shake was equivalent to chocolate milkbutyou could taste the high quality of the milk in the shake which made up for my initial disappointment in how not a shake it was PERIOD Flavorwise the chocolate drink was not too overpowering and was perfect to wash down the potato I inhaled earlier PERIOD

Rating . besides pizza this stand also sells giant cheese sticks which basically means huge mozzarella sticks PERIOD

Angelas Pizza

Angela honey I dont know who you are and frankly I dont know if I care too much PERIOD But you made basically one of my favorite foods giant sized and for that I thank you PERIOD Besides pizza this stand also sells giantcheesesticks which basicallymeans hugemozzarellasticks PERIOD I had this at the fair last year and Ive been dreaming about itall year among other things that I wanted to experience my senior year PERIOD This fried stick of cheese has the perfect balance of cheese and crispy bready coating on the outside PERIOD A friend of mine from college enthusiastically without fail does what she likes to call the cheese stretch test. its simple folksBite keep that piece in your mouth and pull to see how long that piece of gooey cheese will stretch out to PERIOD Try doing this with Angelas giant cheese stick and not only will you be guaranteed to have the longestcheese stretch known to man you will also make eye contact with the cashier whos silently judging you PERIOD Angela Ill forgive you if you give me the recipe for the giant cheese stick PERIOD My email is at the bottom PERIOD

The donut itself is perfectly crumbly with sugar and cider crumbles on the outside and a soft moist texture on the inside PERIOD

Sweet Madelines

If you havent been to The Big Eyou should know that our very own state of Connecticut has a building dedicated to all things Connecticut PERIOD Whats more Connecticut than apple cider donuts Sweet Madelines was a truck that used to take all my money in exchange for their apple cider donuts two years ago PERIOD Last year I didnt see any sign of them but I guess theres no better way to show that long distance relationships are sustainable than by ending my food tour with a Sweet Madelines donut at The Big E a year later PERIOD The donut itself is perfectly crumbly with sugar and cider crumbles on the outside and a soft moist texture on the inside PERIOD The donut itself was not too cakey which I appreciate in any donut PERIOD It had just the right amount of air without making me feel as if I was only eating a ghost of what I used to have walking past the Student Union on fall days PERIOD This donut is definitely one to reminisce on during and after the eating process PERIOD Theres even string lights hung on the rafters PERIOD How romantic PERIOD
