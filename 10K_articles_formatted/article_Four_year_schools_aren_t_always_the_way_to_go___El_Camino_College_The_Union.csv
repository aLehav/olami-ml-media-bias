8664,2023-06-04,"attending a community college never seriously crossed my mind while I was in high school PERIOD

I attended a high school that drilled going to college into our brain since day  of freshman year PERIOD

There was always this negative stigma perpetuated by classmates about community colleges so many people did not apply to community collegesI was one of them PERIOD

I applied to CSUs and an outofstate school because I knew thats where I would be able to receive a Bachelor of Arts BA in journalism without having to take classes that werent related to my major unlike at UCs PERIOD

Although I knew that I would not receive any money from FAFSA I still decided that I would go to a fouryear university after graduating from high school PERIOD

My first choice was San Diego State University but I was not admitted PERIOD

I was accepted to California State University Northridge only to realize it was too expensive PERIOD That led me to my third choice University of Hawaii at Mnoa which I was also accepted too PERIOD

So in the fall of  I set my mind on attending the UH Mnoa because it was cheaper than going to CSUN PERIOD

Also none of my classmates would be attending UH and Id be living in Hawaiiwho wouldnt want that

UH Mnoa was great until I reached my second semester there and I took my first two journalism courses PERIOD

My first journalism classes were being taught by the same professor that had no experience in teaching journalism at the college level and had little to no certainty in what he taughtall he did was confuse me PERIOD

After sitting through the first few classes of the journalism courses I knew that that wasnt where I was supposed to be PERIOD

Thinking about all of the money my parents spent to send me to UH is what kept me there but I also didnt know how to tell my parents that I wanted to come home PERIOD I felt so embarrassed and I felt like a failure PERIOD

Going to class became a chore my grades began to suffer and that took a toll on my mental health PERIOD

Just three weeks before the end of the spring semester I had my biggest mental breakdown after yet another nonproductive day in my journalism  class PERIOD

I was on a flight home two days later PERIOD

Coming home was the best decision I could have made for myself and for my education I just wished I wouldve done it sooner PERIOD

I decided to take a year off to really figure out what I wanted to do with my life and after a year of feeling lost I realized that the only thing that interested me was still journalism PERIOD

I knew that if I ever wanted to be successful in the journalism field I would have to go back to school and get a degree PERIOD

Still feeling a little embarrassed about leaving UH I hesitantly applied to El Camino College to begin classes in the fall of  PERIOD

I am currently in my second semester here at EC and I can confidently say that this is where I know I should be and this is where I want to be PERIOD

I am doing more and learning more here in the journalism department than I probably would have ever done or learned at UH PERIOD

Seeing how some of my close friends are approaching their final year in college while I still have a few years to go until I graduate makes me think about how far ahead I would have been if I would have just started at a community college and transferred to a fouryear university PERIOD

The time it takes to complete a BA differentiates from person to person but the average time it takes to complete a BA when beginning your college education at a community college is  years PERIOD

BA completion varies by type of 4year institution PERIOD Of students who transfer to fouryear public institutions  percent of all transfers  percent complete a BA within six years of starting at a community college according to Community College Research Center PERIOD

I am behind on where I should be compared to people that graduated with me but I am more focused than ever and I am one step closer to reaching my goal of completing my BA PERIOD

Dropping out of UH was a lesson learned but I hope that people do not have to go through what I went through to realize there is nothing wrong with attending a community college PERIOD
