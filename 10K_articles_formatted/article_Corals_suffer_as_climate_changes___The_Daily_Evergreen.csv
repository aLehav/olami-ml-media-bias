ADAM JACKSON  The Daily Evergreen

Environmental activist Zack Rago explains the damaging effects of the  El Nino on the Great Barrier Reef PERIOD Increases in only a few degrees Celsius can result in coral death PERIOD

BAILEY CAMPBELL Evergreen reporterApril  

Thriving and vibrantly colored coral reefs home to all kinds of sea life have long blanketed the ocean floor PERIOD But now much of it lies dull and lifeless PERIOD

Zack Rago is an underwater camera technician for View Into The Blue the first company to capture underwater time lapse footage which can be seen on the Netflix original documentary Chasing Coral. he described his experience in a keynote speech hosted by the Environmental Sustainability Alliance at the CUB Junior Ballroom on Wednesday PERIOD

My job is to literally watch an ecosystem that I love die Rago said PERIOD

His passion for marine life and coral started when Rago spent his summers in Hawaii following his dad on educational projects PERIOD As a child he would catch creatures and explore the ocean later becoming an avid diver PERIOD

Chasing Coral which he is featured in reveals a world that is quickly declining PERIOD It documents one of the largest coral bleaching events ever to occur due to rising ocean temperatures PERIOD

The idea of the documentary was to capture the bleaching event using cameras that needed no human interaction PERIOD Due to unforeseen events the cameras didnt work and the team decided to take pictures manually PERIOD

Failure and science are one and the same Rago said PERIOD The best questions in life come from failure. they dove for  days straight taking photos of the same reef for five hours every day to capture the bleaching PERIOD Rago said watching the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem wither away in front of him was one of the hardest things he has ever done PERIOD

I felt crushed and hopeless watching something I really enjoy perish Rago said PERIOD

Last November Rago and his colleague discovered two new species of coral in the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia PERIOD In this region  percent of the coral died except in one small location PERIOD

This coral reef should not exist Rago said PERIOD It should not be that healthy and it should not have been able to survive through  and . something about these corals allowed them to withstand bleaching in a region they should have died in and Rago hopes to unlock that potential to save other reefs PERIOD This new reef is so rare that the GPS coordinates are a secret PERIOD

The reef is also highly productive and has micro reefs growing on top of it PERIOD The reef itself is over  years old Rago said PERIOD

It has been around for so long that there is a functional ecosystem living on top of it he said PERIOD That is rad. though coral reefs around the world continue to die at an increasing rate Rago said there is hope PERIOD In another region where  percent of coral died a single coral plant survived meaning there is something genetically different about that one plant that could help reefs around the world survive PERIOD

At a certain time during the full moon in November each individual coral plant releases eggs and sperm into the water acting as seed banks rejuvenating the next generation of coral PERIOD

Marine biologists hope they can create a new genotype of coral that is able to survive warmer ocean temperatures PERIOD The idea is to take corals that survive in decimated areas and create offspring with their genetic material PERIOD

We call this assisted evolution Rago said PERIOD Were giving them a helping hand to hopefully cope with the future they are going to see. rago said he hopes that by combining science and art through projects like Chasing Coral the public perception of environmental issues like coral reef death will change PERIOD

Scientists dont get involved to crunch numbers  they get involved because they have a deep care for their subjects Rago said PERIOD They love it enough to continue exploring it for the rest of their careers which is what science is about. this story has been updated to include that the Environmental Sustainability Alliance hosted this event
