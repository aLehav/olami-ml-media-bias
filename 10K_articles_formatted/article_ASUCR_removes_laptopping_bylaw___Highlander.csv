7832,2016-02-08,"at last weeks senate meeting amendments were made to the standing ASUCR election bylaws PERIOD Major changes were made to remove the ban on laptopping in addition to beginning exclusive voting at polling sites limiting campaign spending and diffusing power from the elections director to the committee PERIOD

Elections Director Melina Reyes announced that the elections committee met for the first time on Jan PERIOD  and established a finalized timeline for this years elections PERIOD Filing for candidacy as well as party affiliations opened up on Feb PERIOD  at  a.m PERIOD and ends on March  at  p.m PERIOD Campaigning is to take place during the first three weeks of spring quarter from March  to April  PERIOD

CHASS Senator Casey Thielhart asked why election campaigning last year spanned five weeks but will only span three weeks this year PERIOD Were students first ultimately PERIOD Thats been my main motivation Reyes responded PERIOD She also stated that the primary reason for shortening this years campaign season is because Its exhausted people PERIOD Its taken a toll on mental physical and emotional health. the timeline was approved unanimously PERIOD

The elections code was broken down into six different actions items that were addressed separately with changes in the code being read to the horseshoe by President Pro Tempore Corey Willis PERIOD

Multiple changes to the bylaws took power away from the elections director and instead put more decisions into the hands of the elections committee PERIOD

The entire section of the code to disallow laptopping was struck out PERIOD The justification for me personally is  number one UC San Diego for example  they allow laptopping and they still dont get the same number of voter turnout that we get elaborated Willis PERIOD He felt that saying laptopping forces students to vote is disrespectful to the agency and the intelligence of the students because he believes we are all adults and have the right to say no PERIOD

Instead of utilizing online voting polling sites are expected be set up near the Bell Tower during certain times PERIOD

Another significant change made in the code caps the amount of campaign spending with the intent to level the playing field for those who choose to run PERIOD Reyes justified this change by mentioning one of her concerns that she shared while interviewing for the position of elections director PERIOD One thing that I really highlighted  was that there was not a lot of opportunities for individual candidates and independents to run and the big part of that is that they simply cant compete with these thousands of dollars that parties are able to put out. individual candidates will be limited now to  party candidacy shall be limited to  in campaign expenses per candidate in the party PERIOD If parties do not meet four members they will be allowed to spend up to a total of  in campaign expenses PERIOD

The three strikes penalty was also changed to a five strikes policy in the event of campaign policy violations PERIOD
