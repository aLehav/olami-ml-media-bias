Late on a Monday night students fluttered through the University Art Gallery setting tiny Late on a Monday night students fluttered through the University Art Gallery setting tiny 17thcentury prints into delicate wooden frames PERIOD They had less than a week to prepare for what was for many of them their first public art exhibition PERIOD

This is more handson than any other class Ive taken at the University senior history of art and architecture major Colleen Bernhard said PERIOD

Bernhard is one of the  students running the exhibit as part of the history of art and architecture departments Museum Studies Seminar PERIOD

Last night the University Art Gallery in the Frick Fine Arts Building hosted the grand opening of the classs exhibit Imprint of War Responses in Print which runs until Dec PERIOD  PERIOD The class chose to focus the exhibition on the printmaking work of artists Sandow Birk Jacques Callot and Nicholas Naughton PERIOD The show also includes local artists Andrew Ames Dan Buchanan Joan Iversen Goswell Susanne Slavick Andrew Ellis Johnson and Delanie Jenkins PERIOD

This exhibit is a culmination of months of preparation PERIOD The class initially received about  pieces handpicked by instructor Janet McCall and was tasked with creating a theme PERIOD Since the pieces  which were gathered from the Universitys collection as well as other galleries  shared similarities namely depictions of war in prints the theme was relatively inherent PERIOD But McCall said the class is intended to focus on museum practices over curatorial choices and eventually the class decided to focus on how artists use printmaking to reflect on the atrocities of war PERIOD

Printmaking is a cyclical process and war can be too said senior Christy Savage who helped choose the theme PERIOD Our exhibit looks at the common themes between these two very different cycles. savage is the leader of the Curatorial Team one of the four teams into which the class is divided PERIOD In order to prepare for the exhibition McCall split the class into the Curatorial Installation Interpretation and Documentation Teams PERIOD The team leaders meet with McCall once a week to parallel the kind of weekly staff meetings museums have with curators PERIOD Class time is dedicated to communication between teams and group research into the exhibits material PERIOD

I tried to structure it in a way where the students are doing as much work as possible McCall said PERIOD I find myself collaborating with my students in the same way I do with my colleagues at work. savage and the four other students on her team are in charge of developing the theme delegating tasks and organizing tours at Frick Fine Arts PERIOD The Installation Team worked on assembling the pieces into a coherent exhibit PERIOD The Documentation Team developed flyers advertising the exhibit and managed the classs blog imprintofwar.wordpress.com PERIOD The Interpretation Team assembled information including a display of printmaking tools to educate the public on prints at the exhibit PERIOD

Artwork is rarely reproducible but in the case of prints the entire art revolves around reproduction PERIOD Printmakers etch textured images into metal or wooden plates using metal tools or acid PERIOD They then cover the plates in ink and press them onto a canvas PERIOD

Prints by 17thcentury printmaker Jacques Callot are the oldest on display at the show PERIOD The artist depicted the depravities of war in the 18print series The Miseries and Misfortunes of War. the Installation Team worked with the University Art Gallery to frame the pieces in a way that would not damage the irreplaceable originals from the gallerys collection PERIOD The rest of the pieces were provided by the artists or their hosting galleries PERIOD

Callot published the prints in the midst of the Thirty Years War when the French invaded his native Duchy of Lorraine leaving behind a trail of destruction and disease PERIOD

Although the largest prints are the size of post cards they are packed with visceral depictions of soldiers pillaging and burning entire villages PERIOD The prints then follow the soldiers to their fates hanged by their commanders lynched by peasants or left crippled and begging on the street PERIOD

Callots work directly inspired contemporary artist Sandow Birks much larger 4by8foot prints in the series The Depravities of War. the panels depict scenes of abuse perpetrated by American soldiers including the infamous events at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq PERIOD The final prints show veterans limping on crutches into a crowded Veterans Affairs office PERIOD

The third artist Nicholas Naughton also tackles modern warfare through a reimagining of classic prints PERIOD Inspired by 19thcentury printmaker Francisco Goyas The Disasters of War Naughtons prints are more gruesome than Birks PERIOD

Through images horrific or otherwise we can create sympathetic reactions PERIOD For a moment what we see is a reflection of ourselves and what happens in those images is happening to us Naughton said in an interview with the class PERIOD

The class spent its first month speaking with artists and making field trips to local galleries PERIOD The students visited the Pittsburgh Glass Center to learn about the state and federal grants upon which many galleries survive PERIOD Bernhard said the staff showed them the decisions that go into running a gallery from piece selection to how works will be displayed PERIOD

Now that the exhibit is up and running the class will continue to meet PERIOD The students will read essays about running museums and take a field trip to a forprofit museum Savage said PERIOD

McCall hopes that visitors will not be the only ones taking away a message from the exhibit PERIOD The portfolio of work that the students will have produced for the class can be a real edge for getting an entrylevel position at an artistic organization she said PERIOD

In a competitive job market practical classes like Museum Studies can look great on resums Bernhard said PERIOD

Last summer I applied to internships and got turned down by some because I was lacking experience PERIOD Not professional experience but academic experience because I hadnt taken this class Bernhard said PERIOD The senior originally planned to graduate and to seek a masters degree in art history but this course convinced her to consider pursuing museum studies PERIOD She explained that most galleries nonprofit status makes them less likely to hire and said that they often seek candidates who come in with advanced degrees as well as experience PERIOD

For students looking to get positions at the many small galleries throughout Pittsburgh the chance to put on an exhibition while still in school is alluring PERIOD

McCall also serves as the executive director of the Society for Contemporary Craft which has two gallery spaces in Pittsburgh PERIOD The class allows her to replicate the work environment of a large gallery giving the students a practical understanding of the work that goes into producing an exhibition PERIOD

Sometimes I find myself calling them my staff instead of my students McCall said PERIOD

And once the students are out of school these skills will help them find jobs PERIOD McCall knows about the challenges of getting onto the staff of a museum PERIOD Originally turned down for a fulltime position at a museum she returned to volunteer PERIOD

People got to know me began to believe in me and what I offered McCall said explaining that she eventually got a job PERIOD The rest is art history PERIOD
