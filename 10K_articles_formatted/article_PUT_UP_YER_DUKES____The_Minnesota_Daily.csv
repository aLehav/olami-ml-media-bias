Net Today we remember the birthday of Jefferson Davis PERIOD Who was Jefferson Davis you ask Well while Jefferson Davis is now primarily remembered as the inspiration for the moniker Jefferson Davis Hogg in the legendary CBS television show The Dukes of Hazzard a lesserknown fact is that he was the only president of the Confederate States of America which was an organization of southern states that fought in some war in the 1800s PERIOD It might have been the 1700s PERIOD Were not sure PERIOD
Along with sporting a bitchin goatee Jefferson Davis was a noted white supremacist PERIOD He led a shortlived nation founded on the principle that all men were definitely NOT created equal a philosophy upheld by such luminaries as Hitler George Wallace and most recently David Duke who was never on The Dukes of Hazzard but if he had been he would undoubtedly have been referred to as cousin David. up until recently Jefferson Davis birthday was an official holiday in several states of the deep South PERIOD So on this day remember this good ol boy never meanin no harm who helped kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and almost tore the United States apart WAY before the invention of MTV PERIOD This was your Network historical moment PERIOD

CINEMA VERITE

Net Our erudite film critics continue to write in PERIOD Here is todays sample

From Optimus Prime to Malik Shabazz OK so Godzilla wasnt the most original movie PERIOD Net It didnt have to be original PERIOD A reasonable facsimile of the original series would have been sufficient PERIOD But hey the special effects were great which is about the only redeeming quality of a lot of movies these days PERIOD Net Yeah  did you see those car chase scenes in The English Patient Really though were you expecting some deep dramatic plot in this movie Its Godzilla for petes sake Net No that would be Petes Dragon. get your reptiles straight PERIOD By the way does anyone know what Helen Reddy is doing nowadays Its about a big lizard stomping through a city PERIOD Net We thought that was Norm Colemans campaign film PERIOD Did you expect Oscarwinning performances The main character is a computeranimated lizard Net Oh PERIOD It must be AL GORES campaign film Like theres any more content in a Schwarzenegger Stallone or Jackie Chan movie PERIOD Sigh 

From Campy Okay Network generally I believe you mean well PERIOD But saying Sorority Babes at the Slimeball BowlARama is a disgrace Cmon Sorority girls spanking initiates with a canoe paddle  What college kid wouldnt love that Net We will agree PERIOD The spanking scene was great PERIOD However the biker chick falling for the nerd at the end was unbelievable and the homoerotic tension between the voyeuristic males was in our opinion grossly underplayed PERIOD Or maybe just gross PERIOD Anyway what about Spacegirls From Beyond Infinity Whaddaya think of THAT classic hmmm
Bmovie kitsch is the wave of the future PERIOD With everyone sick of Titanic and all the new box office wonders flopping even Terry Gilliam couldnt get a good movie out there for us Net Which is disappointing since Time Bandits is the greatest movie of all time there will soon be nothing at your local theater but spinoffs of the illustrious Sorority Babes at the Slimeball BowlARama. next time I hope its frat boys bludgeoned with canoe paddles PERIOD Net Youd have to wait in line PERIOD But we digress PERIOD We must stop this merriment for more weighty issues PERIOD Its time for 

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS

From Ry4an With this being the last week of the quarter I rushed to the mall to watch the antics of Brother Jed the bigot we all love to hate but he was nowhere to be found PERIOD Alarmed I ran to the Christian Fellowship booth PERIOD Im happy to announce that while he will not be here for the whole week we will have Brother Jed from today to Friday PERIOD
I would like to remind all those who stand to mock Brother Jed of one thing YOU ARE NOT FUNNIER THAN BROTHER JED PERIOD Net Amen PERIOD Hes serious and thats what makes him funny PERIOD You may be more outrageous but youre kidding so its just not as funny PERIOD If you want to mock him feel free but try to limit it to short 10minute rants PERIOD Were all there to see Jed and if you drown him out youre ruining our fun PERIOD Net Excellent point Ry4an PERIOD Be sure to catch the brother this week  before its too late and hells fires begin lapping at your toes PERIOD If you do not see him there could be wailing gnashing of teeth etc PERIOD Giddyup partners

From TY On Sunday night as I was returning to the Superblock I found a stray cat PERIOD
After taking the cat to the vet they said that it was most likely a housecat which means that someone out there must be sorely missing their feline PERIOD Net Unless of course the cat was maliciously dumped PERIOD In that case get an adoption set up soon PERIOD So heres the description
The cat is a female gray tabby with black stripes PERIOD She has green eyes PERIOD She is approximately four years old PERIOD She is believed to be a house cat because she has had her teeth cleaned by a professional PERIOD Also she is very acclimated to house living  She ran up to my house rode in the car without any problem etc PERIOD She is affectionate too PERIOD The owner needs to step forward ASAP because I am leaving Minneapolis on June  and if there is no owner found I intend on keeping the cat PERIOD
One last thing  the owner of the cat is expected to reimburse me for the vet fees and pet supplies like food and litter PERIOD Dont stress its not an outrageous sum of money PERIOD
If this is your cat please contact the Network who can work as the middle person here if the eversowonderful Network would agree to PERIOD Net Flattery gets you a long way with us.Thank you Network for printing my PSA and I hope the owner will be found PERIOD
