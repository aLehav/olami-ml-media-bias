The number of Carls who apply for the most prestigious fellowships is dropping PERIOD Mike Flynn isnt concerned PERIOD

Flynn interim director of external fellowships helps pair the colleges most promising students with the opportunities that best meet their educational goals PERIOD

In recent years Flynn has seen a marked decrease in the number of student pursuing awards like the Rhodes Scholarship PERIOD He believes that the quantity of applicants is starting to reflect the odds of actually earning a fellowship and doesnt suggest a decrease in the quality of applicants PERIOD

The sharp decline is in part a recognition of how difficult it is to win a Rhodes PERIOD It is very rare to win one at a place like Carleton said Flynn PERIOD With the advice of faculty students are encouraged to apply for the best scholarships they have the highest chance of receiving PERIOD Better advising could be why fewer people are applying for fellowships like the Rhodes PERIOD

We encourage people who have strong records to think carefully about applying for a Fulbright instead of a Rhodes PERIOD The Rhodes Scholarship has a very timeconsuming application. indeed one can only write so many applications before the law of diminishing returns sets in PERIOD It is in a students best interest to focus their efforts where payoffs are the most likely PERIOD

Despite outnumbering Rhodes Scholars  to one Fulbright Scholars are anything but runofthemill PERIOD

Over  fellows have gone on to become Nobel Prize laureates PERIOD Recipients share their distinction with prominent academics and activists such as Linus Pauling Gabby Giffords and Milton Friedman PERIOD

We would like to win about ten Fulbrights every year and we think that application numbers of  or higher ought to get us there said Flynn PERIOD Most years Carleton produces half a dozen or so fellows PERIOD

The last time Carleton produced a Rhodes Scholar  PERIOD

Of course Ivy Leaguers are more likely than their liberal arts college peers to receive such honors PERIOD This isnt so much due to differences in student potential as it is a result of schools like Harvard and Yale having perfected the nomination and advisory processes PERIOD

This week the College will begin to interview candidates to take over for Flynn who is now serving his second year as temporary director and is also chair of the linguistics department PERIOD

The new position will be for a permanent director of external fellowships which number about  as well as fellowships within the College PERIOD

Flynn endorses the change PERIOD He believes the current contenders seem wellsuited for the job PERIOD

Were looking at two kinds of people PERIOD One kind of person has already demonstrated success in advising fellowship applicants at other institutions that are like Carleton PERIOD The other kind of person were focusing on has demonstrated an ability to work with Carleton students or Carletonlike students in academic environments. we know the applicants can all learn the details of the fellowships PERIOD Its really a matter of having the right kind of personality and skill to work well with our students said Flynn PERIOD

The hiring decision is slated for January with the next director taking over in the fall PERIOD Though the deadlines for Fulbright and Watson Fellowship applications have already passed there is still time for upperclassmen to look into other prominent programs PERIOD

Were now gearing up to do Goldwater Truman Beinecke and maybe a few others if we get the right applicants said Flynn who strongly encourages those interested to visit the Student Fellowships webpage PERIOD

Flynns insistence comes from personal experience PERIOD In  he was granted a postdoctoral fellowship through the Fulbright Program which he spent at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen in the Netherlands researching natural languages PERIOD

It had a very dramatic effect on my life said Flynn smiling PERIOD Its how I met my wife
