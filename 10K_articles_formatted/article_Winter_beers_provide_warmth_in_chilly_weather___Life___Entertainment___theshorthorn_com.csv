There is a dark toasty solution to the winter chills rattling peoples bones  beer PERIOD

The cold season marks the beginning of what brewers and beer drinkers call winter beer or winter warmers said Andrew Sparhawk program coordinator for the Brewers Association PERIOD

Stouts and porters are the styles of beer most typical with this season he said PERIOD Historically these beers were brewed in the wintertime with whatever grain was available PERIOD Sparhawk said a common grain used for stouts is roasted barley PERIOD Now with the ability to order variations of grains any time of the year brewers are able to create these beers whenever but aim for the winter to keep with tradition PERIOD

These beers are usually bolder and stronger than most beers he said PERIOD The color is almost always a deep dark brown and contains a higher alcohol by volume PERIOD

Those super toasty deep dark chocolate coffee flavors are indicative of that style Sparhawk said PERIOD

The flavor is reached by either kilning or roasting the barley to a certain level similar to roasting coffee beans he said PERIOD

Sparhawk describes the experience of drinking one of these beers like the feeling of sitting on a big leather couch sipping on something in front of a fire. derek Thorne Kool Keg craft beer bar manager knows all about brewing beer PERIOD On top of managing a bar he also brews his own beer at home PERIOD He said that stouts and porters are traditional types of beer with deep roots in beer brewing PERIOD

Although there is a template to brewing this type of beer there is always room for modification PERIOD

There are certain standards for every style of beer but you can always switch it up and throw your own wrench into it to really try and pull something unique off Thorne said PERIOD

Kool Keg bartenderTony Delaunder had several stout and porter options sitting on the bars shelves PERIOD He recommends barrelaged stouts a type of beer that ages in barrels that at one point contained whiskey or bourbon PERIOD The beer sits in these barrels for up to a year and collects the flavor of the liquor adding another dynamic to the already complex brew PERIOD

While Delaunder jokes that you should drink as many as you can he does recognize the strength of these particular beers and suggests knowing your limit PERIOD

For anyone who hasnt ever drank a high ABV beer before Id say one or two but everybody is different he said PERIOD It depends on how much you weigh how much you drink and whether youve eaten. sparhawk said stouts and porters are the perfect pairing for foods we eat when its cold outside PERIOD He recommends pairing these beers with something that will match the intensity as well as considering the interaction between the flavor of the brew and the choice of food PERIOD

You dont have to be an expert at beer to recognize those sorts of flavors Sparhawk said PERIOD
