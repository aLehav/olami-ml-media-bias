Jesse James  runs with the ball during Penn States  victory over Indiana on Saturday November seventeenth PERIOD

Mike Hull seems to still be getting used to the tight end position providing consistent playmaking ability in Happy Valley  but it hasnt just been one standout tight end during spring practice PERIOD Its been many PERIOD

Its crazy the linebacker said shaking his head PERIOD Every time you turn around theres a new tight end thats making plays. this seasons onslaught of tight ends for Penn State faces a tall task in attempting to top coach Bill OBriens Tight EndU debut in  which saw five tight ends combine for  receiving yards PERIOD However with the addition of fourstar recruit Adam Breneman as rated by Rivals.com and rising redshirt freshman Brent Wilkerson  as well as a presumed healthy Kyle Carter returning  a similarly successful future remains a real possibility for 2013s tight end group PERIOD

Carter tore ligaments in his right wrist late last season before missing the final two games but still finished as the Nittany Lions secondleading receiver with  catches for  yards PERIOD While Carter has been limited in spring practice Wilkerson and Breneman have been catching the eyes of teammates PERIOD

Breneman has eased into drills this spring after enrolling early this semester as the freshman suffered a torn anterior crucial ligament last summer but teammates have liked the small doses of him theyve seen PERIOD

Everybody of course is really excited to see Adam come on the field Carter said PERIOD This spring hes definitely shown a lot PERIOD Theyve held him out a little bit but from when hes been on the field hes definitely shown that hes a guy that can help us. the wellknown recruit has said before enrolling he would prefer to start playing as a freshman  but with the positions depth it remains to be seen how OBrien will handle this situation PERIOD

Another new option at the tight end spot this fall will be Wilkerson the 6foot3 239pound Maryland native whose athletic abilities have been compared to Carters throughout the spring PERIOD

Prior to spring practice OBrien addressed tight end depth as one of the offenses strengths primarily because of players like Wilkerson that many fans hadnt yet heard of PERIOD

Nobody talks about Brent Wilkerson OBrien said in March PERIOD I mean this guy is a very talented young guy that did an excellent job on the Dirty Show scout team last year. meanwhile OBrien also mentioned the returning players besides Carter such as rising sophomore Jesse James and senior Matt Lehman  who combined for  yards and eight of the teams  receiving touchdowns themselves  as reasons to believe the position could easily improve in  PERIOD

Much of the future of this position under OBrien will be determined by how he chooses to utilize a position that he has long favored since his days with the Patriots PERIOD

However regardless of which tight ends ultimately rise to the top of the depth chart it appears certain this position will play an important role come this fall especially with the versatility the Lions possess even with several tight ends on the field Hull added PERIOD

Its tough and it creates mismatches especially whenever they get two or three tight ends in the game at one time Hull said PERIOD Because its like you can run the ball now but you can also pass because theyre great route runners. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
