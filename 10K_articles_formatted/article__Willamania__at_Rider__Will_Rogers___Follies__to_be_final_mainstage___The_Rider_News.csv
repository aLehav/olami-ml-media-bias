On May  Riders School of Fine and Performing Arts final mainstage production of the semester opens Will Rogers Follies. the musical with book by Peter Stone lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Cy Coleman follows the life of iconic performer Will Rogers played by junior musical theater major Forrest Filiano PERIOD

The show is told as one of Florenz Ziegfelds shows featuring his famous ensemble of singing dancing girls the Follies PERIOD Rogers tells the audience his life story as it unfolds featuring iconic characters such as Ziegfeld himself and Rogers wife Betty Blake PERIOD The role of Betty is shared by senior musical theater major Lucy Bobbin and sophomore musical theater major Emily Goulazian PERIOD

Riders production directed and choreographed by musical theater faculty member Robin Lewis features the original Broadway choreography by Tommy Tune including the iconic number Favorite Son. most of this choreography is undertaken by the Follies a large female singing and dancing ensemble that provides spectacle and beauty throughout the course of Wills story PERIOD For Mady Rogers a sophomore musical theater major and one of the Follies learning Tommy Tunes original choreography was both a pleasure and a challenge PERIOD

Tommy Tune is so iconic in the world of musical theater PERIOD There are so many tiny details that have to happen to make the whole picture come to life PERIOD He won the Tony the most prestigious award for Broadway shows for best choreography for this show so its something really special and as a cast we want to do it justice she said PERIOD

Sophomore musical theater major James Vinson had similar feelings about the show PERIOD He said The choreography is truly beautiful and takes the show to another level. vinson plays character Wiley Post while also serving as a swing an actor who learns various roles of the show and is prepared to take the stage in place of the original actor at any time PERIOD

Being a swing is exciting and frightening at the same time PERIOD At any moment you have to be prepared to step in and perform that actors track as if youve been in that role for the whole run he said PERIOD One thing that helped me most was creating a different character for each role I had to swing which made it easier to distinguish one track from another. the show has multiple large dance numbers and features beautiful costumes and elaborate set pieces PERIOD For Rogers the biggest challenge has been maintaining the high energy that is needed to carry out such a powerhouse of a show PERIOD

The hardest number is definitely Willamania. it is the opening number and it demands really high energy PERIOD Its also really long so we all had to work to build our stamina said Rogers PERIOD

There are moments of reprieve where she said she gets to enjoy a softer more playful character like in her favorite number My Big Mistake. this number has a power ballet at the end of it PERIOD Its so dainty and feminine which is a style I love to perform she said PERIOD

For Vinson he said he had to work hard to develop a much different type of stamina PERIOD His character Wiley Post performs his role from a seat in the audience PERIOD

I enjoy getting to watch the show very much said Vinson PERIOD It is unique because when youre in a show you never get to see what is happening onstage through the audiences eyes PERIOD My character is close friends with Will Rogers in the show so it feels like getting to watch one of my own friends every run. another unique aspect of this show is how femalefocused the cast is PERIOD

This is such an empowering show to be a part of said Rogers PERIOD It is such a femaleheavy cast which doesnt happen a lot in musical theatre PERIOD Im so honored to be a part of a cast full of amazing strong and powerful women. readers can catch Vinson and Rogers as well as the rest of the cast of Will Rogers Follies which premieres May  at  p.m PERIOD in the Bart Luedeke Center Theater and runs until May  PERIOD
