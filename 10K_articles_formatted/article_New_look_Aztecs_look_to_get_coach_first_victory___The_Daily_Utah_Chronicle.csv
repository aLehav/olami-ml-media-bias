Its amazing what a coaching change can do for the fans enthusiasm PERIOD During the offseason the Aztecs dumped the underachieving Tom Craft in favor of Chuck Long and the Aztec faithful rejoiced.Longs arrival gave the folks in navy town a reason to be optimistic about  PERIOD His every move was a stroke of genius PERIOD The school even put him on the cover of its media guide PERIOD But that was then PERIOD This is now.Last weekends  defeat at the hands of Wisconsin brought a brutal end to Longs honeymoon and forced SDSU fans to ask the same question that presents itself at the beginning of each and every season Will this team ever have a breakout yearThe Aztecs are coming off a season in which they finished  overall and their  conference record was good enough for fourth in the Mountain West.With  returning starters including a rapidly improving quarterback  was supposed to be the year that the Aztecs would finally start playing up to their potential PERIOD Two games into the season however SDSU has not lived up to the hype.The offense has struggled mightily to move the ball and the defense has not been able to pick up the slack PERIOD And that rapidly improving QB Hes been on his back since the opener against UTEP.Junior Kevin OConnell who won over the new coaching staff with an impressive performance in the spring will likely be out for the season after suffering an injury in his first game of the season just moments after kickoff PERIOD In other words the teams most crucial position just became a major question mark.Whether or not the Aztecs are successful at moving the ball will depend largely on the proficiency of sophomore quarterback Darren Mougey who made his first career start in last weeks game against the Badgers completing  of  passes for  yards.That performance earned the underclassman a spot in the Aztec record books Until last Saturday no SDSU quarterback had completed more than  percent of his passes in his first start.Mougey is more mobile than OConnell and has a knack for making plays with his feet PERIOD He led the Aztecs in rushing in their season opener recording  carries for  yards and two of the teams three touchdowns.The Utes will also need to keep an eye on junior tailback Lynell Hamilton who when healthy has shown enough talent to earn himself a spot on the watch list for the Doak Walker Award which is given annually to college footballs best running backs.The Aztecs lone proven commodity at receiver is Chaz Schilens a 6foot4 junior who came on late last season recording  catches in the final six games while playing opposite of the nowdeparted Jeff Webb.In spite of the teams offensive woes the Aztec defense has given fans a reason to be optimistic about tomorrows showdown with the Utes PERIOD SDSU brought back eight starters from last year and held the Badgers scoreless until well into the second half of last weeks loss.Led by cornerback Donny Baker who already has two interceptions on the season the Aztecs boast one of the top secondaries in the conference PERIOD In four quarters of play Wisconsin managed a paltry  yards through the air against Baker and Co PERIOD Defensively I thought we played well Long said PERIOD We held a big Wisconsin team scoreless for the first half and we played great pass coverage all day.San Diegos defense will also be formidable up front where the Aztecs bring back three starters from one year ago PERIOD The most dangerous of the big uglies is junior end Antwan Applewhite whose speed off the edge netted six sacks in .Were excited for the challenge of Utah this week Long said PERIOD This is a conference game and we still have goals out there in front of us PERIOD Its our conference opener at home and I know our guys will be excited and revved up to play on Saturday night. cancel reply
