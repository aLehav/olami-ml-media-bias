Odorless colorless and tasteless radon gas is a silent killer PERIOD Radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer for nonsmokers killing about  people each year in Minnesota and  throughout the United States PERIOD A Minnesota senator and a University of Minnesota professor are working to reduce these numbers PERIOD This is a mater of public health and safety Sen PERIOD Amy Klobuchar DMinn. said PERIOD Klobuchar introduced the Indoor Radon Exposure Abatement and Detection Act outside a St PERIOD Paul home Friday in front of about  people PERIOD If passed the bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to set national standards for radon testing and training and to define unacceptable radon levels PERIOD It would also create a rebate program to help reduce the cost of installation of radon mitigation systems in newly constructed homes PERIOD Joining her were representatives from various radon research and awareness groups including University radon researcher William Angell PERIOD Angell helped write the bill and has been in contact with Klobuchars staff since November PERIOD I found the senators staff to be very informed about some general issues but not the specifics Angell said PERIOD So a lot of the expertise I brought to the table was associated with my work. angell is a professor of housing studies in the College of Design a University Extension housing technology specialist president of the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists and director of Midwest Universities Radon Consortium PERIOD Minnesota passed legislation in May  requiring all new homes to have radon mitigation systems by June  PERIOD We were the first State Rep PERIOD Kim Norton DFLRochester said and hopefully we wont be the last. norton was the legislations chief author and worked with Angell on crafting it PERIOD Klobuchars bill is fashioned after Minnesotas bill and plans to build off its successes PERIOD Minnesota was ahead of its time Klobuchar said PERIOD Its time for us to lead the rest of the country. hennepin County homes have average radon levels that are three times higher than the national indoor average Angell said at a press conference PERIOD He said constant exposure to that amount has the same effect on the lungs as smoking eight cigarettes a day or having  chest Xrays PERIOD Klobuchar spoke outside the home of Dave Hansen and Karen Lilley who have had a radon mitigation system for more than  years PERIOD A PVC pipe stands up against the wall in their garage and runs into the ground PERIOD With the help of two fans at strategic suction points radon is continuously pulled out of the earth and released at the end of the pipe on the roof PERIOD Its pretty simple Hansen said PERIOD And its still running off the original fans. the system allows Hansen and Lilley to keep radon levels as close to the national indoor average as possible PERIOD While radon naturally exists in every part of the country Minnesota has one of the highest concentrations due to coldweather building methods that often seal air inside the home PERIOD Radon can enter through cracks in floors walls foundations and pipes PERIOD The Minnesota Department of Health estimates that more than onethird of all homes in the state have dangerous radon levels PERIOD With public awareness the danger from radon can be managed and minimized Klobuchar said PERIOD
