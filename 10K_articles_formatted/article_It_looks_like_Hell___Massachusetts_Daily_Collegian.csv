In the aftermath of Tuesdays tragedy rescue workers continued to sort through the rubble and debris scattered in lower Manhattan PERIOD Where once stood the World Trade Center considered by many as the very symbol of capitalism and globalization now appears a scene of ruin and devastation PERIOD

In the damp morning mist two distinct mountains of steel and concrete still smoldered leaving a constant cloud of ash and smoke visible even from the New Jersey side of the Hudson River PERIOD Thunderstorms and highwinds further hampered workers in their continued search and rescue efforts PERIOD

Despite Fridays rain fires persisted to burn in the depths of the substructures PERIOD It looks like Hells city remarked one ironworker just like the pits of Hell. rescue workers also encountered the dangers of falling debris primarily from the unstable American Express and Liberty One buildings PERIOD One volunteer noted that you can actually see the buildings swaying and hear the metal shafts twisting in the wind. many sought shelter in the temporary NYPD headquarters set in the corner Burger King PERIOD Injured workers were also treated in the home of the Whopper where EMTs and nurses hung IVs from wall lamps PERIOD When each building threatened to collapse workers would dart out of the mangled steel and flock to the headquarters only to return again when it appeared safe PERIOD

Both Thursday night and Friday morning injured rescuers could be seen receiving medical treatment alongside food and construction supplies PERIOD Yet the morale of the workers seemed revitalized as an unknown New York Fireman set an American flag atop the peak of the rubble PERIOD

Rescuers etched their way to the top of the ruin in antlike columns passing each piece of rubble down the line PERIOD As the cloud of dust and ash persisted to envelope the workers consisting of firefighters policemen National Guard EMTs nurses and iron workers all were forced to dawn charcoal respirators PERIOD Initially rescuers outnumbered the supplies and many only had surgical masks to protect their lungs from the thick dark air but by Saturday nearly everyone had been properly outfitted PERIOD

Around 400a.m PERIOD Friday morning workers cheers bellowed over the storm as rescuers pulled a trapped police officer from the wreckage PERIOD The present condition and status of the officer is unknown PERIOD

By Saturday the fervent volunteer support had not relented as the Javitz Center the designated volunteer hub was forced to turn away eager citizens PERIOD Traveling from cities as far away as Miami Chicago and even Toronto volunteers reached New York seemingly unaware of what to do and where to go but nevertheless journeyed in hopes to support the crisis PERIOD

Despite the arrival of countless volunteers the Salvation Army chapters and Red Cross stations throughout the city continue to require citizen assistance PERIOD Recruits have worked throughout the night in hopes to sustain the steady flow of clothes food and medical supplies replenishing ground zero PERIOD

The outpouring of support also reached Penn Station NY as NJ Transit Amtrak and Long Island Railroad all provided rescue workers free passage to and from the city PERIOD Manhattan residents have filled their windows with burning candles and occasionally one will pass a church congregation somberly singing America America PERIOD

One NYC Fireman may have put it best after a twelve hour onsite shift he exclaimed its a shame that it takes such a tragedy to bring the country together but at least it is coming together. cancel reply
