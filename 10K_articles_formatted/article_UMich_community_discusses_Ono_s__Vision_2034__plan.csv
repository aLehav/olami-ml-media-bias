One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

The University Insider is The Dailys first faculty and stafforiented newsletter PERIOD This weekly newsletter will give UMfaculty and staff the ability to see the most important issues on campus and in Ann Arbor  particularly those related to administrative decisions  from the perspective of an independent news organization PERIOD It will also provide a better understanding of student perspectives PERIOD





Recently inaugurated University President Santa Ono is leading multiple projects to improve the University of Michigan experience PERIOD One of them is Vision  which Ono announced in November  a 10year strategic visioning plan to implement and enforce the University of Michigans core values across the Ann Arbor Dearborn and Flint campuses and Michigan Medicine PERIOD

Vision  seeks to implement six key values  integrity respect inclusion equity diversity and innovation  through six plans across all UM campuses PERIOD DEI . and the Universitys carbon neutrality plan which span all campuses are included under Vision  in addition to Culture Journey UM Dearborn Strategic Planning the UM Flint Transformation Plan and the Michigan Medicine Strategic Plan PERIOD The University aims to incorporate student input when activating these initiatives and values by holding town halls student focus groups and forums PERIOD

The Vision  project team is currently in phase two of its fourpart plan which focuses on community outreach and engagement PERIOD In an interview with The Michigan Daily project team leader Jenny Faust said because phase two is still in its infancy she looks forward to engaging UM community members to determine the teams next steps PERIOD

We have more questions than answers at this point Faust said PERIOD And that is appropriate PERIOD This is really a collective effort and until we have heard from the many groups and individuals who care about the University and our future we cant say what that vision is PERIOD It will emerge over time. faust added that they have not yet established a clear direction for these initiatives based on student feedback PERIOD However she said the team has been working to incorporate as many student voices as possible through the town hall meetings unitlevel information sessions and focus groups PERIOD

These events are not aimed at implementation but rather at the formation of a collective vision Faust said PERIOD So our job as a project team is to create a space for people to share their ideas and thoughts about the University of Michigan. business senior Clare Walby president of the Ross Student Council told The Daily she and other student organization leaders were invited to attend a roundtable with Ono in the fall to express their opinions on future directions for the University PERIOD Walby said she believes this roundtable was an effective way to incorporate student voices and she looks forward to seeing similar events in the future PERIOD

Something that Ive been really impressed with with President Ono so far is his willingness to engage the student body and connect with the students Walby said PERIOD I think he values their opinions maybe more than other stakeholders which I really appreciate. while she appreciated the opportunity to share her opinions Walby said she hopes to hear more about the specific details of the plan in the future PERIOD

Its very broad and Im sure in the very initial stages of development Walby said PERIOD So Id be interested to learn more about the specifics behind some of these points. lSA sophomore Bilal Irfan president of LSA Student Government told The Daily he is looking forward to the implementation of Vision  particularly the environmental and DEI initiatives PERIOD

Some of the progress that weve seen even since the time Ono has been here has been kind of a cultural shift in the discussion that we have about climate change on campus Irfan said PERIOD With the Fleming Administration Building I know LSA Student Government and Central Student Government have made some progress in working with some of the folks that are looking at remapping the building and creating gardens inside of it PERIOD So just seeing the progress on that front and support from Onos administration to advance that agenda has been really helpful. the demolition of the Administration Building which began in August  aimed to incorporate sustainable practices in line with the Universitys broader environmental goals including reusing or recycling materials and supplies from inside the building and properly disposing of debris PERIOD

Irfan said he hopes to see Ono address student concerns about the ethics of certain UM investments in the Vision  plan PERIOD

Im interested to see how Ono might reform transparency in the Universitys endowment or their investments as well as how hes going to think about the issue of the University possibly having endowed investments in companies that are implicated in human rights violation or in forced labor Irfan said PERIOD

According to the Vision  website the University intends to spend the rest of  compiling feedback from UM community members before presenting the plan to the Board of Regents in January  PERIOD
