The John J PERIOD Koldus Building on Tuesday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD

Honestly I dont understand why we have all these other colleges when we can focus all of our attention on the majors that matter the most College of Engineering Senator Clancy Iguodala said during the March  student senate meeting arguing in favor of passing the Nothing But Engineering Bill PERIOD

The bill was sponsored by the entirety of the engineering caucus and urges the university to embrace its mechanical roots by discontinuing the instruction of any major vaguely resembling liberal arts PERIOD

The seventy-fifth Session of the Texas AM Student Senate demands the university to immediately instate the College of Engineering as the only college deserving of university funds the bill reads PERIOD All other majors shall be ended and students transferred to t.u. the piece was inspired by multiple factors such as President M PERIOD Katherine Banks desire to make the university more efficient and the implicit feeling of superiority radiating from every engineering student on campus PERIOD The Nothing But Engineering Bill voices what every frequent visitor to the Zachry Engineering Education Complex is already thinking

Why do we waste money on providing useless classes such as classical literature constitutional studies and child development when we can code and make robots all day

Needing a simple majority of votes to pass the bill was originally considered a long shot PERIOD However supporters were surprised after nonengineering senators such as political science sophomore senator Bryan Lindell voiced their support for the bill PERIOD

Every day I drive by Zachry and think Man I would love to have some classes there Lindell said PERIOD If transferring to engineering means I wont have to spend all my time in Blocker and Herrington then thats what Ill do. college of Liberal Arts Senator Jane Lausten says the writing is on the wall PERIOD

After the  by  initiative and the hodgepodge of majors thrown together into the Frankenstein experiment otherwise known as the College of Arts and Sciences I am certain that the unforgiving march of engineering will continue Lausten said PERIOD I might as well transfer now instead of waiting for the inevitable. according to the bill nonengineering students will be relegated to that other school in Austin which the bill describes as a university uniquely capable of accepting so many liberal snowflakes who read obscure leftist marijuanafueled literature such as Shakespeare. the bill passed two weeks ago but nothing has happened because of the senates limited authority and no one from the administration read the resolution until March  when a secretary accidentally noticed it on their website PERIOD
