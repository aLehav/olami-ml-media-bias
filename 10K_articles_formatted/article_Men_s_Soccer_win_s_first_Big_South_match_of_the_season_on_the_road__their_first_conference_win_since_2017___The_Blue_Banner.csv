UNC Ashevilles mens soccer team defeated the USC Upstate Spartans  capturing their first Big South Conference win of the season and their first conference victory since October   when they beat Winthrop  PERIOD
Last season the mens soccer team did not win a single soccer match against any Big South opponents with their only wins coming against nonconference bouts against VMI and Woffard PERIOD This win hopes to grant momentum to a team that has struggled in the past seasons and with a new season comes promising new players and different team goals PERIOD
It was a great team win and a fantastic job by the staff and the players PERIOD I couldnt be prouder of the effort from everyone in preparing on short rest PERIOD It was a Big South Conference game so of course its going to be very topsy turvy said Head Coach Mathes Mennell in a statement made after the game PERIOD I thought Upstate was very good tonight and we were maybe a little fortunate that they didnt finish some of their chances but our guys showed great resilience and great character PERIOD We talked about getting back to the things we do well and overall I think we played OK in terms of what were capable of but in terms of the tangible part of the game  the effort the grind the grittiness just being resolute in the approach and finding a way to win  I give our team top marks PERIOD It was a good performance and well enjoy this on the way back to Asheville and then were on to High Point. this season the bulldogs have already matched their win total from  with two wins PERIOD Many of their games have low scoring defensive matchups with the Bulldogs not scoring over two goals in any match PERIOD
Were used to getting in those types of battles PERIOD We have had a lot of games like that this season where we have to play defensive and take our chances when we can get them said Junior Forward Tyson Hichman PERIOD
The most noteworthy player on the team so far this season has been the freshman goalkeeper Jarrett Payne PERIOD In  games Payne has accumulated  saves the highest of any Division  goalkeeper and over ten more saves than the second highest goalie PERIOD The rookie earned his first shutout of his career against the Upstate Spartans PERIOD While this is impressive it could also Natindicate an increased number of shots on goal given up by the defense. despite this stat the players are confident in their backline saying that Freshman Kaleem Shabout has done an excellent job preventing shot in his first season PERIOD
Our backline has been solid at keeping out goals and keeping our team together said Hichman PERIOD Were such a tight knit group and were going to work hard for each other. hichman is playing in his first season at UNCA transferring from UNC Greensboro last spring PERIOD The junior has four goals the most through the first ten games PERIOD Hichman and his teammate Nate Evans who scored the winning goal against the Spartans say that the team needs to improve on creating and seizing more opportunities for goals PERIOD
The teammates had similar mentalities to how they approach these conference games by playing each game with the same attitude and not focusing on the past or the other team but focusing on themselves PERIOD
The game against Upstate was again a defensive battle the only goal coming from Evans in the fifty-sixth minute of the game PERIOD The Bulldogs earned the victory but were still out shot  to  PERIOD Payne had eight saves during this game compared to the Upstate goalkeeper who only had two PERIOD
I dont think theres a better feeling than scoring a goal especially when that goal is the game winner said sophomore Evans It felt amazing to be able to celebrate with my teammates PERIOD Im not sure if there is a college program that is as good friends on the field as they are off the field. hichman agrees that the teams chemistry is one of its strongest aspects PERIOD
The season for mens soccer has entered into the second half where the opponents will be mostly Big South teams vying to collect conference wins and qualify for the playoffs PERIOD The test for the bulldogs now will be to maintain their momentum they have gained in their first shutout win of the season PERIOD
Its a different mentality when you step into the locker room PERIOD These are the games that matter PERIOD These are the games that will get you into the playoffs Evans said PERIOD
