A total of  students in the newly offered Launching the Venture course in the McDonough School of Business will publish individual books on business and entrepreneurship PERIOD
Taught by the cofounder of the home services moderating company Zaarly professor Eric Koester the course tasked students with writing books on seeking employment launching products consulting services or innovating PERIOD

With Koesters help the students found publishers for their works PERIOD Though the students acknowledged the process was lengthy and complicated they emphasized the value of their experience PERIOD

Brian Bies MSB  a member of the MSBs Entrepreneurship Fellows Program wrote a book about how independent video game creators are becoming leaders in gaming entrepreneurship PERIOD

My book is called Indie Gaming Finding Entrepreneurial Success in Video Games and its about how independent game developers are the new generation in the world of video game entrepreneurship Bies said PERIOD

Bies added that despite foreseeing the amount of work that lay ahead at the time of enrolling he was motivated by the prospect of using his knowledge on the video game industry to produce something of value PERIOD

We knew day one of class that we would be writing books and the reason why I did not drop the class then was because I wanted to see what I could do in the area of expertise of what I was most interested in Bies said PERIOD

According to Will McDonald MSB  whose book Vested explores how the intersection of finance and technology is reshaping the world of investment he had never been much of a writer prior to taking the class PERIOD McDonald said his involvement in StartupHoyas allowed him some insight into finance and technology PERIOD

Im a finance major here at Georgetown but I had been leading StartupHoyas for the past couple of years and so Ive always been interested in the cross section of finance and entrepreneurship and specifically venture capital McDonald said PERIOD

Despite his interest in the subject McDonald originally did not see himself successfully writing a book about it but he was able to manage his time and complete his work PERIOD

Im not much of a writer so going into the process I wasnt sure I would possibly end with a book PERIOD I wouldnt have seen myself writing a book to start with but we were able to push forward and chunk it out piece by piece and sort of streamline it which made the process a lot easier McDonald said PERIOD

For some students like Jaclyn DiGregorio MSB  the project represented an opportunity to reflect on past experiences and the lessons and opportunities obtained from them PERIOD DiGregorio through her book The CUSP Method Your Guide to Balanced Portions and a Healthy Life revisited a complicated freshman year that saw her gain  pounds which motivated her to become a certified nutrition coach and create her own nutrition startup CUSP Three Six Five PERIOD

My freshman and sophomore year when I came to college I gained about  pounds based on really restrictive eating habits and I was so confused because I was on a constant diet but so much heavier and it wasnt even just my weight but I felt very low confidence levels didnt do that well in school DiGregorio said PERIOD

DiGregorio hopes that her book and her startup which will launch April  can teach people how to live fully PERIOD

My book is combining psychology of human eating behavior and cuttingedge nutritional science to understand why people eat the way they do and why diets are temporary so it really teaches people how to live a healthy lifestyle DiGregorio said PERIOD

Daniel Lysak COL  found the inspiration for his book How to Become an Excellent Server in his previous experiences working as an employee in the food industry PERIOD

My book is particularly about how to be an excellent server tipping well above  percent every time PERIOD I worked in the food industry for a very long time so for me personally its a topic that I am extremely passionate about Lysak said PERIOD

Although the process was complex Lysak expressed his gratitude for Professor Koesters guidance and said Koester helped them undertake the task successfully PERIOD

Its a cumbersome process but this is something that youll always have so for maybe those who may take the class in the future who may have this opportunity Lysak said PERIOD Im just so grateful to Professor Eric Koester for all that he has done  his leadership and his mentorship  and really taking on such a large task. according to Lysak having overcome the process for the first time he would be willing to write a book again in the future PERIOD

Absolutely PERIOD You know I think having overcome the first mountain PERIOD I know what it takes and I know what the process is Lysak said PERIOD
