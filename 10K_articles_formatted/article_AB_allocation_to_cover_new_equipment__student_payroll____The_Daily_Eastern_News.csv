Money from the Apportionment Board reserve account is up for Student Senate approval to further fund the Recreational Center for new equipment and student payroll PERIOD



At the end of March the AB allocated  to itself Student Government University Board Sports and Recreation and the Players Dramatic Performances board for their budgets for the next fiscal year PERIOD These are the only five boards eligible for AB allocated money which comes from the student activity fee PERIOD

Jen Fanthorpe student vice president for financial affairs said the only other things AB money funds are unexpected costs like when extra sporting activities arise such as an Eastern athletic team making the playoffs PERIOD In these situations that board needs money to host the extra event PERIOD

This year AB developed a budget for Sports and Recreation which asked for  but received  less than that when the AB allocated it  PERIOD

AB has a reserve fund of all money not allocated from the current years budget and Fanthorpe said any one of the five boards can ask for the money on a casetocase basis PERIOD

So far this year the AB has allocated funds from the reserve to help fund the UB concert committee Family Weekend and the Recognized Student Organization Banquet PERIOD

Fanthorpe said the UB which funds events such as concerts and Sports and Recreation were most heavily cut from the initial allocation for their budgets PERIOD

Ken Baker director of student recreation made a request for an additional  to help fund new weight room equipment including rubber weights an exercise machine and an industrialgrade electronic scale PERIOD

Fanthorpe said some of the equipment in the new allocation request was in the initial Sports and Recreation budget request for next fiscal year PERIOD

Baker said schools like Western Illinois University have  fulltime employees as opposed to Eastern where there are only three fulltime administrators PERIOD

We rely a lot on student workers Baker said PERIOD

Baker said  of the  will go toward student payroll which cost sports and recreation  last year PERIOD

Baker said the money is justifiable because the Student Recreation Center is open  weeks out of the year  and a half hours a day from  a.m PERIOD to midnight PERIOD

Were open more than any facility on campus besides the computer lab Baker said PERIOD

Baker also said he didnt see the extra allocation as a competition and that this year will be the first year Sports and Recreation will ever receive extra money PERIOD

The money will not be allocated until the recommendation is approved by the Student Senate PERIOD
