Gracie Niswanger owner of Missoulas Pole Fiction has been teaching pole dancing for eight years PERIOD Her journey began with yoga and has since progressed from AcroYoga and aerial arts to pole dancing PERIOD

Eight years ago Gracie Niswanger discovered her gateway drug PERIOD

Her story began within a yoga studio at the University of Montana PERIOD She quickly became addicted to the way she felt expressing herself and moving her body. soon she took movement classes which led to pole dancing PERIOD

Now four years later Niswanger owns her own Missoula studio Pole Fiction. the studio has hosted over  clients including eight semesters worth of UM students PERIOD For many the onecredit UM class Niswanger offers Pole Fitness and Dance has brought joy empowerment and confidence PERIOD

There is something about pole dancing that really encourages you to see and feel your body as something sexy PERIOD It helps you embrace whatever your body looks like as something powerful and beautiful because no matter what you look like on the outside you can still achieve some pretty remarkable things UM graduate Josh Martelon said PERIOD

Gracie Niswanger hopes to create an environment of inclusivity through her classes at Pole Fiction.The studio has welcomed over  clients which include over eight semesters worth of University of Montana students PERIOD

The UM class is offered twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays in a small studio above the Freestone climbing gym PERIOD Niswanger set up the course for students who may have never seen a pole let alone used one PERIOD

The class begins with basic terminology pole grips spins and moves PERIOD The curriculum then progresses to more challenging movements when students feel ready PERIOD

I was super embarrassed and anxious at first UM business student Cameron Dorey said PERIOD I felt so welcomed PERIOD It didnt matter if I wasnt good at it or screwed it up or I didnt look the way I wanted to in the mirror because I was supported and trying my best. niswanger adapts the course based on what students need and want PERIOD For example some students may have difficulty with aerial work or going upside down PERIOD She said she would never force students to do anything they arent comfortable with PERIOD Instead she will have them participate from the floor or practice something different PERIOD

Martelon said during the class he chose to do things a little differently for his comfort PERIOD As a man it isnt comfortable for him to straddle the pole PERIOD Niswanger worked with him and helped him learn different pole work while his classmates practiced things he could not do PERIOD

Niswanger said many students would struggle on their first days of her class but shes noticed they usually begin to gain confidence by the second week PERIOD One of her favorite things about teaching pole dancing is watching students do something they never thought they could do PERIOD Niswanger said its her goal to make the class inclusive to all people  she even has an unofficial studio motto Humans as the humans want to be seen in our space. for her that includes sexuality gender body type or background PERIOD Niswanger said as long as clients are willing to try within the class and respect their fellow dancers anyone is welcome PERIOD

And sometimes students are given much more than respect  they are given a community Niswanger said PERIOD

Mia McKinney a womens gender and sexualities major said one of her favorite memories of the class was the time she first tried a difficult position without assistance and was met with an unexpected reaction PERIOD

Everyone was doing their own things but then I finally got it and I was like whoa and everyone was like oh my god and cheered me on PERIOD It was just so cute and I loved the community we were able to build McKinney said PERIOD

This strong sense of community isnt rare within the pole world PERIOD In the Great Depression era strippers began to create pole dancing as a new form of expression in their community PERIOD Though it was once linked to sex work it has now moved beyond and into the world of fitness PERIOD Niswanger frequently credits everything about modern pole fitness to sex workers and strippers McKinney said PERIOD

If you have touched a pole you need to thank a stripper Niswanger said PERIOD

For students who are interested in taking the UM pole class but wary about the commitment of an entire semester Pole Fiction also offers a single beginner class for  PERIOD

I would say just go for one class because like the worst thats gonna happen is you feel super awkward but you learn something from that anyway Dorey said PERIOD Its not like I walked in all confident  it was super awkward  but theres so many different people of all shapes and sizes and its not like this one little standard youre supposed to be PERIOD I think everyones welcome there and they make that really clear and obvious. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
