Lady laxers look to tame Huskies

As the race for the regular season title nears the tape the No PERIOD  lacrosse team has one more hurdle to clear before the playoffs PERIOD The Lady Huskies of Northeastern University are only  but they might as well be undefeated as far as Penn State is concerned PERIOD The game in Boston on Sunday is a crucial game for the Lady Lions because with a loss they could lose their top ranking and a bye in the upcoming NCAA playoffs PERIOD

 said senior captain Beth Thompson who will be playing in her last regular season game PERIOD 

If the playoffs were to start this weekend the entrants in order would be Penn State Virginia Temple New Hampshire Loyola MD. and Massachusetts PERIOD UMASS is the only team of those five that the Lady Lions have not faced PERIOD The rest have been trampled by the runandgun passing game Penn State has used to blow by opponents PERIOD

In a year where the hurdles were supposed to be tall ones the Lady Lions have cleared them as if they were anklehigh PERIOD Penn State has run up a  record stumbling only at Maryland where football coach Bobby Ross figured the only way to avoid another embarrassing Terrapin loss was to delay the game for three hours so his team could practice PERIOD

After the national lacrosse scribes and coaches had depicted the Lady Lions with their rookie head coach and young team three starting seniors as alsorans in the preseason Penn State blew by then No PERIOD  Virginia and No PERIOD  Temple to assume the topranking in only the second week of the season PERIOD There has been no looking back since then as the Lady Lions have simply blown most of their opponents out of the water leaving dropped jaws and shaking heads in their wake PERIOD And there is nothing in the log book that points to Northeastern as becoming anything but another piece of flotsam PERIOD

The Lady Huskies finished  last year and were shut out  last year by Penn State at the University of New Hampshire PERIOD It was the only game in the series between the two teams PERIOD Northeastern coach Joan Brodericks goal at the beginning of this year was to finish the season at . and it is pretty obvious her team wont PERIOD To make matters worse a potentially tiring game for Penn State with No PERIOD  Dartmouth on Saturday was cancelled as the Ivy League school is participating in the Eastern Collegiate Association Conference tournament PERIOD

 Thompson said 

Thats not to say that Northeastern will give up the ship before the sails are under way PERIOD Head Coach Sue Scheetz knows it and while she is not overly concerned she knows better than to look past anyone PERIOD And besides the Lady Huskies style of defense plays right into her practice plans PERIOD

 Scheetz said PERIOD 

The NCAAs will begin with the first round of play next Wednesday PERIOD The semifinals will take place on May  and the championship game will be played at the University of Maryland of all places on May  PERIOD
