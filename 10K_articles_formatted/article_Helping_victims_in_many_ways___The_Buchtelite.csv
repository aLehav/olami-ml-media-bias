Sherri Bevan Walsh has wanted to be a prosecutor for as long as she can remember PERIOD

When she was attacked  years ago her passion to make a difference in the community didnt falter  it grew stronger PERIOD

Walshs enthusiasm for her job is obvious PERIOD She hits the table as she speaks and her voice raises when she describes some of the criminals and their effect on the victims with whom she works PERIOD

Her goal is to bring justice when it is needed and to not let victims of crimes be victimized a second time by the criminal justice system PERIOD

The trial process for victims can be exhausting and emotionally and physically draining PERIOD

Victims have rights under our revised code PERIOD They have the right to participate in the process and be heard as to their feelings about a sentence that an individual receives PERIOD They have a right speak at a sentencing hearing PERIOD

We go even further so their rights are protected Walsh said PERIOD

Her offices way of helping of victims deal with their situation is the Victims Advocate Program PERIOD

We do things like keep them notified of court appearances PERIOD We give them a lot of support meet them in court and sit with them PERIOD Sometimes a victim has to stay outside the courtroom for hours PERIOD We stay with them and answer questions Walsh said PERIOD

The Victims Advocate Program also refers victims to counseling services and helps them if theyve lost time at work or have medical bills to pay PERIOD

We make sure that they understand the process and that they truly understand whats going on Walsh said PERIOD We dont want them to be confused by all the legal talk PERIOD Its our job to make sure they know what is happening PERIOD

The Victims Advocate Program also has a connection with the University of Akron PERIOD

Weve had an active coordination with the School of Social Work Walsh said PERIOD Many of the masters program students need to have an internship and several have done it with us PERIOD Weve hired several of the interns to be victim advocates PERIOD

As the chair of the States Victim Assistance Advisory Board and a former victim Walsh has used past experiences to aid in the support of those whose lives have been affected  but she said the job isnt always easy PERIOD

People say sometimes How can you do a job like this day in and day out We hear and see the worst of the worst so often and people say Doesnt that get depressing Were dealing with all this horror and tragedy and youre meeting people whose lives have just been shattered PERIOD

Walsh knows that her involvement with victims is vital to getting them the justice they deserve PERIOD

What we also see is all the good we do for these crime victims and the community when someone gets put away for a long time and we feel like the community is safer Walsh said PERIOD As a prosecutor you tend to focus on that the good you can do and the good you can make out of the horrible crimes that sometimes occur PERIOD

Walsh said that her office doesnt resolve a case without victim input and makes every effort to make sure all agree to the resolution of a case PERIOD

When she reflects on her own trial process she realizes that she didnt have a big part in it PERIOD Thats something she doesnt want any victim to have to experience PERIOD

The victim is the person who has suffered the most and they should be satisfied with the result of the case Walsh said PERIOD I want them to leave the courtroom feeling that justice was served PERIOD

Having a role in the trial process can be a traumatic experience for the victim Walsh said PERIOD At first most victims dont want to have a role in the process  they just want it to be over PERIOD

Having known what it is like to go through a trial and not have a large role Walsh always encourages them to take the stand if they feel they can PERIOD

A lot of times victims are scared to get in front of everyone and have to recount the whole situation PERIOD

But a lot of victims Ive worked with have come up to me after they took the stand and said Im really glad I did this PERIOD I felt like I got the last word and thats what I needed PERIOD

And while Walsh has devoted a lot of energy and time to helping victims she also puts a lot of effort into helping people not become victims of crime PERIOD

Caution is a word that Sherri Bevan Walsh repeatedly emphasizes PERIOD

For her it is an imperative action that all must take when going through their daily lives PERIOD

There are random acts that occur that are beyond anyones control Walsh said PERIOD Any time youre out walking about be aware of your surroundings PERIOD

Though the assaults in the university area between September and January occurred at night Walsh and  other women were attacked in broad daylight over the course of several months  years ago PERIOD

Walsh stresses that point A person can become a victim of crime at any time of the day PERIOD

While there is no way for individuals to completely protect themselves Walshs experience reminds her that certain precautions can be taken to aid in ones safety PERIOD

Dont daydream  always be looking around PERIOD Always be paying attention she said PERIOD  A lot of criminals like to sneak up on people and catch them off guard and surprise them PERIOD

Youre going to scare off a lot of criminals because they dont want to be identified PERIOD If youre on the ball theyll look for a weaker target PERIOD

What saved Walsh though was the selfdefense course she took her senior year of college in  PERIOD

A lot of the moves I learned in the classes were key Walsh said PERIOD You cant just take them and never think about them again though PERIOD You need to practice them PERIOD

Walsh spoke highly of the University of Akrons attempts to deter violent acts on and off campus PERIOD

Making such classes mandatory would never be a bad idea she said since getting students to sign up can often be the hardest part PERIOD

In addition the University of Akron Police Department recently announced it will conduct free house safety checks to those who request them PERIOD

Absolutely every person should take advantage of it Walsh said PERIOD

Times were a lot different when she was in college from  to  Walsh said which is why she holds UAs efforts to maintain a safe campus in high regard PERIOD

Looking back on when I was in college rapes and assaults were never publicized PERIOD There was a certain sense of not wanting the bad publicity PERIOD

The University of Akron is getting the message out there and trying to address the problem PERIOD
