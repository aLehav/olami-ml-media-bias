The Santa Barbara County Sheriffs Dispatch received a  call at  p.m PERIOD from the suspect Charles Watson Ford PERIOD Ford told dispatchers he had shot and killed someone and was going to kill himself at his  Elm St PERIOD residence PERIOD

Dispatchers kept Ford on the telephone while deputies responded to the scene PERIOD Upon their arrival deputies evacuated approximately  to  residents at an apartment complex across the street from the scene and approximately  to  people who were present at a nearby skatepark and Amtrak stop Santa Barbara County Sheriffs Dept PERIOD Public Information Officer Lt PERIOD Mike Burridge said PERIOD

This residence is the last one on Elm Street just south of the Amtrak stop PERIOD The train stop and the skatepark are about  yards away PERIOD Both places at this time in the evening can have a lot of people present Burridge said PERIOD We evacuated immediately because at that point you dont know what the suspect is capable of what his intentions are or what his next move is going to be PERIOD You have to do what you can to protect the people in the surrounding area. once the perimeter of the residence was almost secure Ford told dispatchers he was going to exit his home and surrender to deputies PERIOD At  p.m. the suspect emerged from his residence naked  not at the request of deputies  and was taken into custody immediately PERIOD According to Carpinteria Station Lt PERIOD Butch Arnoldi Ford appeared to have symptoms of alcohol intoxication when he emerged from the residence PERIOD

He was extremely intoxicated in fact when he was ordered out of the house he fell down face forward and scraped his face across the driveway pretty badly Arnoldi said PERIOD When he fell there were no deputies within  feet of him so its not even questionable as to whether the injury may have been caused if he had been pushed to the ground. when deputies entered the residence they located a deceased female lying on a bed in one of the bedrooms with an apparent gunshot wound PERIOD Deputies also discovered a 6inch stainlesssteel .357magnum handgun in the living room PERIOD Arnoldi said authorities have identified the woman however her name will not be released until the next of kin is notified PERIOD

Basically it was a domestic dispute and the gentleman was angered because the lady wanted to terminate the relationship so he decided to shoot her and threatened to shoot himself as well he said PERIOD

There is one other male subject who resides at the Elm Street location but he was not present at the time of the shooting Arnoldi said PERIOD

There was one witness to the incident who was at the skatepark and heard the gunshot but he didnt come forward until later on he said PERIOD

According to the Sheriffs Dept PERIOD records Ford has no previous criminal history PERIOD He has been cooperative since his arrest and was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail on one count of murder with no chance of bail PERIOD
