5110,2023-11-04,"a House committee passed it Wednesday PERIOD

by  Libby GeorgePublished  April  

University students should have a voice in the selection of Board of Regents members the House Higher Education Committee said Wednesday PERIOD

A committeepassed bill would add two student members to the Regent Candidate Advisory Council a 24member body established in  to recruit and identify regent candidates PERIOD

Jake Elo a Carlson School of Management junior and student regents representative said students have a say on every selection committee up to and including the presidential search PERIOD

Elo said that since the board chooses which programs are eliminated and consolidated within the University  which affects all students  students should be represented in regent selection PERIOD

The Senate president and the House speaker would each appoint a student member to the council and a student would serve one twoyear term PERIOD The Legislature also chooses other council members who serve sixyear terms PERIOD

Council Chairwoman Rondi Erickson was unavailable for comment on the bill PERIOD

Summer cash crunch

As the state faces significant shortfalls in its grant program grant money for students taking summer classes might become a thing of the past PERIOD

A bill introduced last week by committee Chairman Doug Stang RCold Spring was considered for inclusion in an upcoming omnibus bill  which will include all committee higher education funding recommendations PERIOD

These are just items we have to discuss Stang said adding that other recent additions to the grant program should also be looked at for elimination PERIOD We need to clearly define a front for students so they know what to expect. committee members  as well as Minnesota State Universities Student Association Chairman Yorgun Marcel  criticized the bill PERIOD

Our position is ultimately we need to ask ourselves what our ultimate goals are PERIOD To eliminate summer grants would only impact students more and increase the number of students who are turned away from our system Marcel said PERIOD

He added that MSUSA advocated prorating child care and workstudy grants  which would adjust the sum of money students receive based on availability  rather than eliminate summer grants PERIOD

Minnesota Student Association Legislative Affairs Committee Chairman Andy Pomroy said MSA has not taken an official position on the bill  although he said it would impact University students PERIOD

I dont think a lot of students would be in favor of that bill Pomroy said PERIOD Its obviously unfair for students who have to take classes that are only offered in the summer. narrow the scope

Also under the funding ax are grants for students attending private forprofit higher education institutions PERIOD

The contentious bill would remove forprofit institutions from state grant program eligibility  which legislative analyst Kathy Novak said would save approximately . million PERIOD

Do we really want to give state money to a forprofit organization asked bill author Marty Seifert RMarshall PERIOD

Private schools have been big winners in the jackpot of the Legislature he added and twoyear private colleges  which make up the majority of forprofit schools  have seen grant money increase approximately  percent since  PERIOD

Although Marcel also testified against this bill committee members were suspicious of its benefits PERIOD

If we do have private forprofit schools that are accredited by the federal grant program Im not sure that we should remove that as an option for students said Rep PERIOD Ray Cox RNorthfield PERIOD

Marcel said MSUSA does not oppose those schools receiving grant money however he said there need to be priorities in the budget crunch PERIOD

We believe in priority during tough times  the numbers are there and they are staggering to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities as well as the University of Minnesota Marcel said in reference to the more than  percent of grant money that goes to private schools PERIOD

I dont think we would support it just because it doesnt affect us Pomroy said adding that it would be overstepping MSAs bounds to take an official position PERIOD
