While in Ghana Sandberg partnered with James Kofi Annan founder of Challenging Heights a nongovernment organization that rescues child victims of trafficking PERIOD Together they conducted interviews with  religious leaders and pastors in Ghana PERIOD The interviewees were a diverse group of Presbyterian Islamic Catholic Baptist nondenominational and Mormon religious leaders PERIOD Each interviewee was asked a series of six questions about their awareness of modern day slavery in Ghana and their proposed responses to such an issue PERIOD

Of those interviewed  percent said they had a good understanding of human trafficking in Ghana PERIOD Often even if they had a good understanding of the issue the religious leaders said they could not respond to the issue because they did not know how to PERIOD  percent of the interviewees said they had very little knowledge of human trafficking in Ghana PERIOD One lay minister said An issue like this is important but we must address whats in front of our eyes. percent said they had no basic knowledge of the issue PERIOD

Sandberg explained how just like we are often ignorant of the reality of human trafficking here in Grand Rapids those in Ghana often believe that human trafficking is a problem that happens elsewhere PERIOD No one wants to acknowledge that it exists right in their backyard right under their noses says Sandberg PERIOD

Sandberg went on to say that if a culture is complacent the problem will only continue to worsen until there becomes a major force that mobilizes toward change that has money behind it and that has significant push to change cultural attitudes. sandberg also remarked on how long it takes for cultural attitudes to change Its gonna be like cleaning up an ecosystem PERIOD It takes a tremendous amount  youve got to get in at the level of basic fundamentals before you can shift it over. in the meantime there are several steps that can be taken to improve the situation of human trafficking in Ghana PERIOD Sandberg suggests that funds be mobilized for the education of churches in Ghana that the government needs to be persuaded to view human trafficking as a priority and to implement strategies in multiple institutions and that churches and Ghana need to make human trafficking a priority of their own PERIOD

Sandberg has many plans for furthering her study of human trafficking in Ghana PERIOD She hopes to help develop a theology of human trafficking in Ghana to write a social justice play in modern day slavery and to make a film to be distributed as a social justice campaign PERIOD
