9896,2022-12-09,"on Nov PERIOD  the Philip Lynch Theater proudly presented their first showing of A Christmas Carol A Live Radio Play by Joe Landry which is a unique take on the classic tale written by Charles Dickens PERIOD

Whats different about this one is its the story of A Christmas Carol but its set in the 1940s in a radio studio said director and theater professor Annie Calhoun PERIOD So were pretending that were broadcasting the airwaves to everybody and instead of being fully memorized the cast has scripts like they would in a radio station. the holiday classic came to life as a live 1940s radio broadcast which was complete with vintage commercials and the magic of sound effects and musical underscoring PERIOD The classic holiday tale is about three ghosts taking Ebenezer Scrooge on an exciting journey to teach him the true meaning of Christmas PERIOD

Instead of moving all around the stage they have to be at their microphones because were sending it out said Calhoun PERIOD Theres a sound table that does sound effects so its like youre listening to the story. there are a total of  cast members in the play PERIOD Each student plays multiple roles in the show since there are many minor characters within it PERIOD Senior biology major Brendan Roark plays Freddie Filmore aka Ebenezer Scrooge PERIOD

Freshman Andrew Dills plays the Ghost of Christmas Present PERIOD Freshman psychology and illustration major Katelyn L PERIOD Butt plays the Ghost of Christmas Past PERIOD fifth year senior theater and music industry double major Alex Schedel plays the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come PERIOD

Theres  students in the cast and seven of them have never done a shortlisted play before which is really cool said Calhoun PERIOD There is a senior biology major whos playing Scrooge which is kind of neat. the play had four more showings after Thanksgiving break which were on Dec PERIOD  through Dec PERIOD  PERIOD The running time of the play was  hour and  minutes with no intermission PERIOD



The theater department decided to have a production of this play this school year because it brings feelings of joy especially around this time of year PERIOD

I think it brings a lot of joy around the holiday time and a lot of people havent gone out and seen theater since COVID19 said Calhoun PERIOD Its bringing a lot of people out because they know the name since its familiar. with it being a live radio play for each performance the cast members came on stage and sang a few Christmas songs with the audience who then applauded when the applause sign lit up PERIOD During the play there were a couple of times when the cast sang commercial songs PERIOD

The cast sings a couple carols with the audience because theyre warming them up since they need the live audience for the applause said Calhoun PERIOD They have another little commercial moment where they stopped the story for fruitcake and sang a little song about fruitcake. as the director of this play Calhoun thinks that its a great play for new students at Lewis to join the theater program since theres not many lines to memorize PERIOD

I love that our cast is from all different majors and I love the story because my favorite character is Fred Scrooge his nephew said Calhoun PERIOD This year I particularly thought of Fred as somebody that we should all be like. students and community members were encouraged to watch this play because of the short running time and seeing a live performance is completely different from watching something on television PERIOD

Its joyful and fun and its a short show so it doesnt take a lot of time out of your day said Calhoun PERIOD Theres always something that youre gonna get from seeing a live performance whether it be some sort of joy and merriment or a message of the show that hits you in a different way. the next production that the Phillip Lynch Theater will be putting on next semester is The Sun Serpent which is a story that portrays the strength of the human spirit PERIOD
