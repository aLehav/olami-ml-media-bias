Title An Alternate Route

Halloween is a goofy holiday PERIOD Basically a week or two depending on how many parties you go to dedicated to eating candy and pretending to be something were not and everyone just goes along with it PERIOD So weird PERIOD But awesome PERIOD I love candy corn PERIOD

According to Wikipedia and the Library of Congress and I have to say Im so glad the federal government found it worthwhile to publish a paper on Halloween The Fantasy and Folklore of All Hallows Halloween has its roots in a Celtic festival Samhain PERIOD The festival marked both the beginning of winter approximately our Nov PERIOD  and the time of year that the ghosts of the dead walked amongst the living It was then that the spirits of people who had died during the year journeyed into the great unknown which means that if you see something that looks like Michael Jackson Saturday night it might really be him so run the other way PERIOD

Samhain was eventually coopted by Christian missionaries those crafty fellows and evolved into All Saints or Hallows to be hallowed means to be sanctified or holy Day PERIOD The night before All Hallows Day All Hallows Eve is the time of the most intense activity both human and supernatural  All Hallows Eve became Hallow Evening which became Halloween. i dare you to wish someone a Happy Hallow Evening PERIOD I bet they wont give you any candy PERIOD

Apparently we can trace back the tradition of wearing costumes and going door to door for treats to the Celtic belief that fairies witches demons and the souls of the dead roamed around on Samhain Food and drinks were left out to appease them and eventually people started dressing like demons witches etc PERIOD and would literally go around doing tricks for treats. never in my life have I had to do this which is good because I dont have many talents or tricks I could do  I cant even snap or whistle  but I really like candy. theres more in the article about the origins of traditions like pumpkin carving and about superstitions in general PERIOD One of the coolest things though I thought some of yall might like to try Saturday because I definitely want to Halloween a time of magic also became a day of divination with a host of magical beliefs For instance if persons hold a mirror on Halloween and walk backwards down the stairs to the basement the face that appears in the mirror will be their next lover. so first unless you are happily in a relationship or maybe even if you are make sure that on Saturday you go to at least one party in a place that has a basement PERIOD Second make sure that when you try this youre sober enough to be able both to walk backwards down a flight of stairs and also to focus on the mirror youre holding PERIOD It may be best to try this as soon as you find some basement stairs rather than after youve had a few rounds of punch PERIOD

Theres also another factor to consider when you attempt this Im not sure if a face will just magically appear in the mirror or if the superstition simply means that whoever happens to be going up the stairs while youre going down them will be your next lover PERIOD Id be careful whos around when you try this out just in case its the latter PERIOD You dont want to be stuck with your friends ex as your new lover PERIOD Or worse yet with your friend PERIOD But maybe youre more open to experimentation than I am. its funny that we take Halloween in stride PERIOD No one questions the fact that we decorate our houses with scarecrows cobwebs and ghosts or that little kids dressed like princesses and superheroes run door to door asking random people for treats PERIOD Every other day of the year kids are told to avoid strangers with candy but on Halloween they go looking for them PERIOD

I dont think of Halloween as a festival for spirits or dead souls and I dont know of anyone else who does This is kind of odd because thats what it began as PERIOD But now Halloween is about dressing in sillysluttyscary costumes and partying with other people who are doing the same PERIOD It seems the meanings of things can change over time The rituals and traditions may remain but the original purpose does not PERIOD Things have the meanings that we as individuals and as a society assign to them PERIOD Thankfully Halloween for us centers around dumb costumes and too much sugar not the undead walking on earth PERIOD

Have a Happy Halloween and a good week PERIOD Timing this year was perfect We can wear orange and black on Saturday and kill two birds with one stone PERIOD Another weird phrase I bet colorcoordinating on Saturday will be considerably easier than literally killing two birds with one stone PERIOD Or even killing one bird with a stone. until next time PERIOD
