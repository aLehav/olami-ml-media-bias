Watch this Prisoners

Director Denis Villeneuve made his 153minute masterpiece pass by in what felt like seconds PERIOD Maybe it was Jake Gyllenhaals performance as a detective with sexy slicked back hair and an endearing eye twitch or perhaps it was Hugh Jackmans warriordad mentality  whatever the case the tension starts high and keeps growing throughout the film PERIOD Prisoners follows the kidnapping of two young girls and the ensuing efforts made by Gyllenhaal and Jackman to track them down PERIOD Though it sometimes tries to accomplish too much Prisoners is one of the most captivating movies in recent months PERIOD The film is particularly devastating for anyone with children PERIOD Youve been warned PERIOD

Listen to this The Bones of What You Believe by Chvrches

The longawaited album of the most hyped band on the Internet is finally here and it does not disappoint PERIOD Hailing from Glasgow Scotland Chvrches have blown up the blogosphere over the past year with songs like Lies and The Mother We Share. lead singer Lauren Mayberrys voice doesnt dominate but is instead situated perfectly against the stellar synth pop beats of her band mates Iain Cook and Martin Doherty PERIOD You may want to seriously consider jumping on board if you havent already PERIOD

Eat this Pumpkins

Pumpkin pie pumpkin butter pumpkin lattes pumpkin milkshakes and plain old pumpkins are popping up all over the place  bloggers have been going nuts about the triumphant return of pumpkin spice lattes PERIOD Pumpkins are out to overtake apples and the public doesnt seem to mind PERIOD Indulge in your artificially flavored pumpkin drinks if you must but dont forget to pick a carving contestant from your local pumpkin path PERIOD Nothing beats fistfuls of stringy orange goop PERIOD
