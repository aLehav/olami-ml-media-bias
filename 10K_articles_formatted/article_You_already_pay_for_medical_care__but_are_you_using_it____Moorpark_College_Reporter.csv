You wouldnt pay for the parking lot not to use it and you wouldnt pay for health care to not get medical help PERIOD

Yet thats exactly what happens every semester at Moorpark College when students dont take advantage of the Student Health Center PERIOD For a school that has roughly  enrolled students thats a lot of wasted money on the student end PERIOD

Students who lack interest in the Health Center might not know about the services they already pay for when enrolling in their classes PERIOD When asked about the Student Health Center a large number of students said they knew about it but not any of the services that are offered within PERIOD

Student health coordinator Allison Barton says that Moorpark students might be wise to visit the Health Center first rather than going directly to a family doctor PERIOD

We want students to know they can come to us first if they have any issues while on campus Barton said PERIOD And sometimes we can help out faster than their primary physician. funded by the mandatory student health fee of  every student must pay when registering for classes the Student Health Center provides a plethora of services from little things like free BandAids and condoms to more serious help in the form of mental health counseling PERIOD

Students who came through the K12 schooling system no doubt remember the nurses office in their elementary and high schools as the resource on campus for medical attention PERIOD However at some point in the transition from high school to college students stop taking advantage of oncampus medical care PERIOD

I use the counseling sessions at the Health Center Said Adrianna Fuentes 24yearold biology major I would like to see an increase in the limit of counseling sessions PERIOD Currently its only six session per semester. she suggested an increase to eight or nine sessions PERIOD

There are select services available through the Student health center that may have a small cost such as cholesterol testing flu shots and any prescription medicine all of which can be much cheaper than offcampus prices PERIOD

Above all Barton feels its important that students realize that if they have no other options the Student Health Center should be taken advantage of for as long as they are enrolled at Moorpark College a goal Barton and everyone at the health center is constantly promoting PERIOD

We want students to feel comfortable using the student health center said Barton
