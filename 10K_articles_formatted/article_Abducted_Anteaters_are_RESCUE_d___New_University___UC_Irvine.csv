Close your eyes PERIOD Imagine you are an 8yearold child in Africa PERIOD Imagine living in fear of being taken away from your family by a rebel army PERIOD Imagine having friends that have disappeared who you know are now child soldiers and sex slaves PERIOD Imagine going to bed at night and wondering if you might be next PERIOD Imagine if no one knew PERIOD

Then imagine if your voice was heard PERIOD

On April  the nonprofit organization Invisible Children was the voice of these abducted children PERIOD Twelve people from the UC Irvine Invisible Children Club as well as six from Campus Crusade for Christ stood together in solidarity along with the  other Orange County participants to represent the plight of these kidnapped children in an event titled The RESCUE PERIOD

At  p.m PERIOD on Saturday April  in  cities in  countries tens of thousands of predominately high school and collegeage people gathered at abduction sites where they stapled pictures of themselves with family to a board that represented leaving their families and friends behind PERIOD They were then led on a threemile walk in which they were required to carry all of their bags and sleeping amenities while holding onto a rope representing the abduction process of the children in Africa PERIOD This led participants to their LRA Camp where they would wait to be rescued PERIOD Once there people were not allowed to leave the camp until two things happened the site got media coverage and a celebrity referred to as a mogul came to free them PERIOD

In the months prior to the event the staff at the Invisible Children headquarters in San Diego held screenings at various locations of their newest film The Rescueincluding a screening at UCI at the beginning of March PERIOD

In preparation for the event individuals were encouraged to post Youtube videos send emails make phone calls and send snail mail to various celebrities and media outlets calling them out to come to the rescue PERIOD Trusting the media and moguls to answer participants in the event prepared to wait determined not to go home until someone came PERIOD

The Orange County Fairgrounds served as the Orange County event location PERIOD After the  participants successfully stopped traffic and stimulated their fair share of honks for peace along their threemile walk they were marched to their LRA Camp PERIOD Here participants were given paper and magazines to write creative letters and make art projects to our California senators Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein urging them to push for peace in East Africa PERIOD While they wrote politically active actress Melissa Fitzgerald best known for her appearances on The West Wing and Greys Anatomy gave a speech as well as a representative of California U.S PERIOD Congressman Ed Royce PERIOD

At that time it was announced that there was no confirmed celebrity mogul to rescue Orange County PERIOD As the night progressed announcements were made that all six abduction sites in Australia had been rescued PERIOD Billy Boyd Lord of the Rings had rescued the Edinburgh site in Scotland and Kristen Bell Veronica Mars was on her way to Los Angeles PERIOD Despite Orange Countys lack of a rescuer spirits stayed high as people meandered and made friends making sure to snap a few pictures with the guy carrying his cardboard Joseph Kony is Bologna sign PERIOD

Then at about  p.m. the atmosphere completely changed suddenly people were running towards the stage and shouts of Whats going on were heard among the masses that had instantly come alive PERIOD News filtered back The band Paramore had come to the rescue

As cameras flashed and video settings were adjusted on phones and cameras Haley Williams of Paramore read the Invisible Children rescue anthem PERIOD

We are the masses the misfits the moguls media millennials doing what we can with what we have our voice  we are shaping human history by closing the divide between resources and responsibility distance and disinterest awareness and action  we are here to amplify the chorus of their cries and rescue Joseph Konys child soldiers Williams said PERIOD

As cheers arose from the crowd the elation of having been rescued easily overshadowed any disappointment caused by the bands quick departure due to a photo shoot early the next morning PERIOD Dance parties and epic dodge ball games began as the crowd settled in for the night PERIOD Orange County had officially done its part PERIOD

For  years Joseph Kony has been abducting children from their homes in Northern Uganda forcing them to massacre their families and fight in his Lords Resistance Army LRA PERIOD What began as a conflict between the north and south has become the crazed obsession of a mad man PERIOD Claiming spiritual prowess Konys abduction of these children had gone largely unnoticed PERIOD

It wasnt until six years ago in  when three college students from California Jason Russell Laren Poole and Bobby Bailey took a trip to Africa that would change everything PERIOD Upon learning about these children who were being forced to night commute to governmentguarded safe locations the three made their first film about the conflict Invisible Children Rough Cut in  PERIOD

Since the injunction of the organization in  Invisible Children has held three sleepout events to raise awareness for these children PERIOD The first was the Global Night Commute in April  which resulted in the virtual end of night commuting for these children PERIOD The second was Displace Me in April  which resulted in the U.S PERIOD State Departments appointment of Tim Shortley as senior advisor of conflict resolution in representation of Uganda and in allowing the Ugandans to return home from their displacement camps PERIOD After this event in  peace talks progressed as never before PERIOD A temporary ceasefire was instated and Kony agreed to sign a peace treaty PERIOD But when the day came Kony didnt show up PERIOD And on Christmas day  Kony began abducting children again this time from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan PERIOD

The event this past weekend Invisible Childrens third sleepout rally encouraged awareness of this particular issue The RESCUE of Joseph Konys child soldiers PERIOD

However getting rescued was not so simple for all of the event locations PERIOD After the first night about  sites still remained PERIOD Three buses of people from sites that had already been rescued called the Rescue Riders were sent out by Invisible Children to sit and wait with the sites that were not rescued PERIOD The first stop for the SoCal Rescue Riders was Las Vegas where they waited with the participants until they were finally rescued by Mel B also known as Scary Spice on April  PERIOD Slowly but surely as the Rescue Riders made their rounds to the remaining cities the numbers dwindled to the final two rescue sites Richmond and Chicago PERIOD Gavin DeGraw came to Richmonds rescue on April  leaving Chicago as the last site standing PERIOD Then the decision was made Chicago wasnt going home until Obama or Oprah showed up PERIOD

When Oprah arrived at her television studio on May  for her Live in Chicago episode she was met with  enthusiastic faces and asked for five minutes of her time PERIOD And she delivered PERIOD

One can only hope for a similar story for these children in East Africa PERIOD As they wait to be rescued join the movement at www.invisiblechildren.com PERIOD
