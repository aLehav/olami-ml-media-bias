7742,2023-11-05,"trinity students ended the year with a musical bang PERIOD They held concerts to celebrate the conclusion to this school year and say goodbye to the graduating seniors PERIOD

The Choral Union and the Trinity Symphony Orchestra came together at  p.m PERIOD on Saturday April  at the Parker Chapel PERIOD Ken Greene professor of music and Gary Seighman director of choral activities were the conductors for the night PERIOD

This annual concert allows the choral union and the orchestra to come together and perform alongside their professors PERIOD

Its sort of the repertoire every year Seighman said PERIOD Its also a great opportunity because we have a lot of alumni community club members and a lot of faculty and staff who join and perform with us PERIOD We usually have a good number of faculty that do that every year so its good it gives a nice opportunity to sing next to your science professor doing a piece like that its a totally different context outside the classroom which the students love and the professors love. the concert began with Te Deum H PERIOD  which was composed by MarcAntoine Charpentier and performed by both the Choral Union and the Trinity Symphony Orchestra PERIOD It included various solos sung by Trinity students PERIOD Then the Orchestra performed Pastorale dt H PERIOD  composed by Arthur Honegger PERIOD It concluded with the Choral Union and the Orchestra performing Toward the Unknown Region composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams PERIOD

The conclusion to the concert was successful in leaving the audience feeling the energy and the fire of the music PERIOD

The last one is a piece that is very humanistic and its about the limitless possibilities that people have that they can explore and the music affirms that with the huge sound at the end Greene said PERIOD

These two talented groups came together that night to bring to life these historical pieces and they truly excelled in doing so PERIOD They gave an exciting performance that brought the audience to their feet in a standing ovation fit for the marvelous performance PERIOD

The Trinity University Handbell Ensemble and the Brass Quintet gave a concert at  p.m PERIOD on Sunday April   at the Ruth Taylor Recital Hall PERIOD The Handbell Ensemble was conducted by director Diane Persellin PERIOD The Brass Quintet is a studentled group that performed alongside the Handbell Ensemble PERIOD

This was the spring concert for the Trinity University Handbell Ensemble and for the first time we combined forces with the new ensemble Trinity Brass and thats a studentled group so we thought it would be really fun to put our two groups together Persellin said PERIOD

They performed a series of songs that included Magnifica Fanfare Tempest Dorian Dance and All American Hometown Band. one song How Can I Keep From Singing included a solo by Valerie Jeannin PERIOD The Handbell Ensemble made the concert even more interesting by adding many techniques PERIOD

I look for really challenging music and I also look for music that is very diverse PERIOD I dont want everything to sound the same because with hand bells there arent a lot of different things PERIOD We look to try different things through the concert try different techniques and different instruments and solos PERIOD We want some fast pieces of course and some slow pieces Persellin said PERIOD

Another way in that they made the concert a big hit was by performing Michael Jacksons Smooth Criminal which Matt Hawley arranged and turned out to be a very successful endeavor PERIOD

I told the seniors they could do a piece on their own and that they could pick it PERIOD I thought they would just order something online but Matt decided to arrange something so he told me he was going to do this Michael Jackson piece and I said Go for it and so he did it totally on his own PERIOD They practiced on their own they arranged the music on their own PERIOD It was really a hit too Persellin said PERIOD

Both concerts turned out to be very successful PERIOD They accomplished their mission of leaving the audience wanting more and bringing about the anticipation for next year PERIOD

The music department will be offering several other concerts before the end of the semester PERIOD The Trinity Symphonic Wind Ensemble directed by James Worman will perform Johann de Meijs Lord of the Rings at  p.m PERIOD on Sunday April  in Stieren Theater PERIOD
