On a temperate lateautumn day a few months ago my father and I climbed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to look at the most patriotic of American landscapes PERIOD The reflecting pool the National WWII Memorial the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol lined up like a row of standing soldiers PERIOD

Its been almost  years since Ive been here my father reminisced PERIOD The last time I was here you couldnt even see all of this beautiful grass  there were so many thousands of us standing shoulder to shoulder pissed at Nixon sick of that war. he didnt ask but beneath his words lay an obvious question PERIOD

Why after nearly five years of a war that was originally justified on what we now know were false premises that has killed  American soldiers and up to  million Iraqi civilians violently uprooted . million Iraqis from their homes and cost American taxpayers nearly  billion dollars why is your generation not doing what we did

Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom in  these questions have been as difficult to answer as they are necessary to ask PERIOD And in a city like Santa Cruz so proud of its progressive activism and so given to 1960s countercultural nostalgia these questions are nearly inescapable PERIOD

And yet our generation continues the critiques Where our parents generation was engaged and idealistic we are passive and cynical PERIOD Where they were cooperative and violently antiestablishment we are selfabsorbed and materialistic PERIOD The list of selfevident generational opposites goes on and on PERIOD

Beyond these simple blackandwhite assertions are common explanations with a bit more historical perspective PERIOD Our parents antiwar activism drew inspiration and practical lessons from the civil rights movement PERIOD In MLK JFK and RFK 60s activists had charismatic figures to rally around PERIOD They watched the grisly scenes of the Vietnam War unfold on their TV screens every night PERIOD Perhaps most importantly they had draft notices and the death letters of friends who werent coming back PERIOD Weve lacked all of these things and have remained relatively quiet about our war PERIOD

Questions about the apathy of our generation have plagued me for years PERIOD Now on the eve of the American invasions fifth anniversary they ring in my ears louder than ever PERIOD But this is because Im beginning to reformulate my own answers to such questions PERIOD

Im beginning to see signs that we are slowly waking from our civic slumber PERIOD

First of all were voting now in numbers that actually carry some weight in national elections a fact that became abundantly clear with the Iowa caucus PERIOD In this significant first primary campaign stop young voters ages  through  flooded the polls increasing their turnout from  by  percent PERIOD

A recent Time magazine feature tracked the spike in youth voting which has extended from Iowa and the early primary states through Super Tuesday and has continued to lift Barack Obama to an uninterrupted  primary state victories since then PERIOD In The Year of the Youth Vote columnist David Von Drehle wrote of Obama His campaign has become the first in decades  maybe in history  to be carried so far on the backs of the young. the article displayed a poll that compared general youth interest in the  presidential elections to  and  PERIOD According to the poll  percent of  through 29yearolds said they were paying close attention to the campaign as opposed to  percent in  and a paltry  percent in  PERIOD

In our generations own slightly detached digitalage way we have also turned the Internet into a powerful grassroots weapon that has the potential to revolutionize American politics PERIOD

The emergence of rapidly growing online organizations such as MoveOn.org has created a new avenue for mass protest and organizing that was simply not available to youth a decade ago PERIOD MoveOn has a network of over  million members and can make a strong mass political statement immediately PERIOD The organization is currently demanding that superdelegates allow voters to decide the Democratic candidate and it has rapidly gathered over  petition signatures to apply significant political pressure PERIOD

Outside of cyberspace our generation has also exhibited its nascent idealism and willingness to sacrifice in its littleknown but significant volunteer efforts PERIOD A poll recently used by Mother Jones magazine indicated that todays youth are volunteering at a higher rate than any point in the last  years PERIOD

So perhaps our generation isnt so apathetic after all PERIOD

There is certainly an encouraging trend of increased political activism and involvement PERIOD What remains entirely unclear is how this general shift will affect the way we relate to our war whose bloodencrusted legacy will define these years of our political maturity PERIOD

On April  when the American occupation of Iraq officially becomes five years old we might not stage mass antiwar protests that rival those of the Vietnam era but we must find a way  our own way  to exercise the passion and idealism weve always had for our country PERIOD
