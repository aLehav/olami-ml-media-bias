Editors Note This article discusses the ongoing IsraelHamas War and includes links to content that viewers may find distressing PERIOD

I am a Jew PERIOD I am a proud IsraeliAmerican and the grandson of a Holocaust survivor and a veteran of two wars in Israel PERIOD My father is a ninth generation Israeli and my grandmother grew up in Jerusalem during the final days of Mandatory Palestine and the  ArabIsraeli War PERIOD We can trace my familys presence in what is now the State of Israel since the days of the Spanish Inquisition and expulsion of Jews in the early sixteenth century PERIOD I have at least a dozen relatives in Israel right nowmost of them spent the past week in bunkers and every single one my age has been called from reserves put on a uniform and deployed to defend our country PERIOD

I am also a graduate of the phenomenal Gettysburg College history program and am pursuing a masters degree focusing on Israeli history PERIOD So lets start with a history lesson to contextualize the horrific events of the past weekend PERIOD

Most people have never heard of Haj Amin alHusseini the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and one of the most prominent Arabs in Mandatory Palestine PERIOD Husseini was responsible for engineering the Arab riots and massacres against Jews in  which killed  Jews and the  Arab riots that left about  Jews dead PERIOD In  he traveled to Berlin where according to the Jewish Virtual Library he petitioned Hitler to accord to Palestine and to other Arab countries the right to solve the problem of the Jewish elements in Palestine and other Arab countries in accordance with the interest of the Arabs and by the same method that the question is now being settled in the Axis countries. after World War II during which the Mufti spread Nazi propaganda to Arabs across the Middle East recruited Muslims in Yugoslavia into the SS and Wehrmacht and encouraged European leaders to stop Jews from fleeing their countries leaving them vulnerable to the Nazi genocide machine Husseini returned to Mandatory Palestine where he continued to agitate the early Arab wars against the Jews and according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum continued to produce and disseminate antiZionist antiJewish and antiIsrael propaganda until his death in  PERIOD

We saw the Muftis legacy this weekend when Hamas a terrorist group that was quite literally founded on the murder of Jews if you dont believe me look at Article  of their  charter tragically murdered at least  Israeli civilians in the single deadliest day for the Jewish people since the end of the Holocaust PERIOD We saw it when terrorists went from house to house murdering babies in their cribs shooting children and murdering countless Israeli farmers in their beds PERIOD We saw it in the charred and decapitated corpses of infants PERIOD We saw it when they burnt Israelis alive in their cars PERIOD We saw it when they murdered a child in front of her siblings and parents PERIOD We saw it when they murdered a pregnant mother and left her lying dead next to her fetus still attached to her via the umbilical cord and stabbed through with a knife PERIOD We saw it when they shot a grandmother took a picture of her body lying in a pool of her own blood and posted it to her Facebook wall PERIOD We saw it when they paraglided onto a music festival for peace murdered at least  peopleand raped women next to the corpses of their friends so many times that they were seen bleeding in their pants in the videos taken of them begging for their lives as they were dragged away PERIOD

This last one especially hits close to home for me since two of my cousinsboth womenhad purchased tickets for this festival and decided not to go for personal reasons PERIOD Whenever I see images or hear stories from survivors of the Reim Music Festival Massacre I will always think GD forbid that couldve been my cousin. but it wasnt just in Israel where we saw the Muftis legacy this past week PERIOD We saw it in Sydney Australia where hundreds stood outside of the Sydney Opera House chanting Fuck the Jews Gas the Jews We saw it in New York City where the Democratic Socialists of New York promoted a rally celebrating the murder of Israeli civilians in the name of Palestinian Resistance cheering when speakers mentioned the  missiles that were fired on Israel saying that the real terrorists is the state of Israeland mocking and cheering the dead Israeli civilians PERIOD We saw it when they gathered to counterprotest a rally in solidarity with Israel and displayed graphic images of dead Israelis to the largelyJewish audience PERIOD We saw it when one person at this rally held up an image of the Nazi swastika not even hiding his brazen genocidal intentions PERIOD We saw it when Black Lives Matter of Chicago tweeted a picture of a Hamas paraglider unapologetically saying that they Stand with Palestine. we saw it at the University of Wisconsin where a group of students chanted Glory to the murders in support of Hamas PERIOD We saw it in Dearborn Michigan where over a thousand people cheered during a rally after the speaker said that Hamas are not the terrorists Benjamin Netanyahu is the terrorist. we see it in the halls of Congress where flagrant antisemites such as Rashida Tlaib refused to condemn the brutal murder of innocent civilians and blamed Israel for bringing this massacre upon itself where multiple members of the Democratic Socialists of America DSA including Tlaib Ilhan Omar and Cori Bush have remained silent and refused to condemn the New York chapter for promoting an event celebrating terrorism or even for disavowing the single person holding the swastika to their credits Congressman Shri Thanedar unlike his colleagues has both disavowed the rally and resigned from the DSA and Representatives Alexandria OcasioCortez and Jamaal Bowman both DSA members put out statements condemning this rally PERIOD We see it every time someone celebrates the Palestinian resistance against Israel every time someone repeats the phrase from the river to the sea ie all of the territory that is currently the State of Israel between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea Palestine will be free advocating for the genocide of all Jews living in Israel every time someone repeats the false and antisemitic claim that Israel is an apartheid state every time that we hear the false claims that antiZionism is not antiSemitism PERIOD We see it coming from people on the far left cheering for decolonization in the name of social justice. but where they spew hate celebrating the murder of innocent Jews we spread love and compassion PERIOD We responded to this brutal violence with according to CBS tens of thousands of people attending the funeral of a murdered 24yearold woman in response to her mothers and sisters request for ten people to come so that the proper Jewish ritual could be performed mourning this loss of life and ensuring that her grieving family was not alone in this difficult time PERIOD We gathered together to sing our national anthem and express our dearest hopes that one day we will be able to have a homeland of our own in peacein airplanes filled with Israelis traveling back home to defend their country in balconies of crowded apartment complexes in gatherings of heroic men and women sacrificing their lives for their country and in bomb shelters while missile alerts sound off PERIOD We celebrated weddings of young Israelis both before and after they answered the call to serve their country PERIOD We prayed thanking GD for sustaining us and keeping us healthy and asked Him to continue protecting our men and women who left home to defend their countries PERIOD

Beyond the Israeli community we unified together in horror as these nightmares unfolded PERIOD Regardless of nationality ethnicity race or religion Americans Europeans Japanese Arabs anyone with a soulno matter what their political opinions are towards the larger IsraeliArab conflict and the ultimate question of how to peacefully solve it came together to condemn and oppose the unadulterated hatred and savagery that occurred this weekend PERIOD

Ismail Haniyeh former Hamas Prime Minister said that we love death like our enemies love life. and that indeed is the fundamental difference between the monsters who organized and perpetrated these inhuman crimes and Israelis PERIOD We love life PERIOD We grieve when it is taken needlessly PERIOD And no matter what we will fight to our last person to preserve and defend innocent lives PERIOD

As long as there is a single Jewish soul continuing to spread that love and compassion no matter what they do to us the face of evilrepresented by men such as Hitler the Mufti and the barbarians who perpetrated these murderswill not win PERIOD So long as our Jewish spirit remains so too does that beautiful spark of life that wonderful compassion PERIOD

I am a Jew PERIOD I am living proof that Hitler lost his genocidal crusade PERIOD And we the Jewish people and the nation of Israel will survive this to prove that Hamas loses theirs PERIOD I stand with Israel now and forever PERIOD Am Yisrael Chai PERIOD

Very good article

October  

Thank you for sharing PERIOD
 My prayers are with the victims and families  of all who have endured an attack so horrible that one cannot comprehend PERIOD  Any organization or group who would commit acts of terror as horrific as what was  forced upon innocent peaceful civilians do not deserve to live PERIOD  Evil like this must be destroyed or there will never be peace PERIOD

God Bless Israel and the families of all those effected PERIOD

October  

First off I am Jewish PERIOD  As you well know  Jews can disagree on everything PERIOD  This is from  Caitltlin Johnstone PERIOD  A lot of the distortion around this current crisis arises from confusion between peace and the baseline status quo PERIOD Because Israel had been trucking along at the same status quo for so long people assume there was a state of peace when Hamas attacked it which was why the western politicalmedia class were able to frame it as an unprovoked attack PERIOD But in reality the status quo in Israel has been one of continually escalating violence tyranny and abuse for generations not one of peace PERIOD

The trouble with abusive dynamics that have been going on for a long time is that after a while those who arent directly affected by the abuse tend to get used to that way of being and start thinking of it as normal PERIOD So when theres pushback against that abusive status quo it looks to them like it came completely out of nowhere at the hands of an unprovoked aggressor PERIOD

Stand on someones face for long enough and one day it will surprise you if he eventually bites your foot PERIOD You might even feel like you were the victim because thats just what youd gotten used to PERIOD  httpsHwww.caitlinjohnst.onepmiddleeasternershavewordsfor  She has writen a lot recntly about what has happened in I Israel PERIOD  I would also read this article from Chris Hedges he as written about Israel and and also about Christian Facisists PERIOD  Neither of these writers are antisemites  Johsstone had mentioned a couple of times she admires Jews and follows a number of  Jewish Pundits PERIOD  httpswww.caitlinjohnst.onepmiddleeasternershavewordsfor   Hedges covered the Mid East for  years for the New York Times PERIOD  Haartz and the Times of Israel blame Netanyahu for the situation  in Israel as do a number of other Jewish people PERIOD  I would check out the links in Hedges article espically in the first paragrah PERIOD  And this interview with this Norm Finklestein PERIOD  Also google Miko Peled mint press news PERIOD   A lot to chew on here PERIOD  I am not trying to change your opinion but  there are two sies to every story and some tims more PERIOD

November  

Sanford
Have you ever lived there Do you even know what you are talking about
Israel pulled ALL of the soldiers and military presence out after the Land for Peace Oslo Accords PERIOD Palestinians were given their own police force and right to self govern PERIOD We had open borders in which Palestinians came to Israel to work PERIOD
Then came the Intifadas and Israel and to close the borders for protection PERIOD Palestinians still had the right to self rule and self police PERIOD Then they VOTED IN Hamas and the terrorism escalated PERIOD
HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT USES CITIZENS AS HUMAN SHIELDS PERIOD That is the other side to this story PERIOD
