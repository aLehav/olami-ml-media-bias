5995,2023-07-11,"people love to discuss music in extremes deeming records or artists either brilliant or trash without leaving much middle ground PERIOD The latest Eminem album is not as bad as the consensus claims but it will try the patience of even his staunchest fans PERIOD Eminem is arguably one of the greatest rappers of all time not based off of his popularity but rather his body of work  especially his first few releases PERIOD But in the past few years the quality of his music has fallen off growing repetitive and stale  and The Marshall Mathers LP2 follows suit PERIOD

To begin on a high note Eminems latest is a showcase of his lyrical talent PERIOD Eminem has always been and still is one of raps most gifted lyricists stringing together rhymes with unparalleled skill PERIOD He weaves and twists together convoluted phrases with impressive proficiency no matter how disturbing the lyrical content can be PERIOD

But rampant misogyny and violence run through his wellexecuted lyrics PERIOD He drops homophobic slurs far too frequently and goes into gratuitously gory detail about the physical harm he wants to cause to women PERIOD These aspects made him provocative early in his career when he coupled them with songs that were risktaking and innovative enough that their content was defensible PERIOD This time around he ran out of fresh ideas lazily partaking in the overused practice of rapping over classic rock songs including in Rhyme Or Reason and Love Game. most of his popculture references are also woefully out of date making Eminem look like an outoftouch dad PERIOD

There is a solid Texas connection as Denton folk singer Sarah Jaffe sings background vocals on the opener Bad Guy. the strangest moment comes with Headlights which features vocals from Nate Ruess of Fun PERIOD and basically sounds like one of the bands pop songs with Eminem rapping the verses PERIOD While it does not entirely work it does showcase Eminems strongest work on the album as he makes a starkly emotional apology to his mother  his confessional style coming off as selfaware and refreshingly sympathetic PERIOD

The Marshall Mathers LP2 shows that Eminem is well past his prime and seems unwilling to push out of his comfort zone PERIOD The album is not the creative resurgence many hoped it would be but that wont stop diehard fans from downloading itfor themselves PERIOD
