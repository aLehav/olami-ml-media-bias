The Universitys Student Union Activities and KJHK joined forces this year to create the first ever Midwest Fallfest PERIOD This festival isa culmination of art music and film gathered from the local area as well as from student submissions PERIOD

This inaugural culmination of Lawrence and Kansas City areaartists a number of them KU students has been in the works for the past year PERIOD Former SUA board member and University graduate Dustin Worst proposed the fest last year to allow KU students a safe environment to get together.After the board members were replaced for the next semester the project fell into Garrison Krotzs lapthis years live music coordinator for SUA PERIOD

This was a difficult challenge to pull off especially since this will be the first time Krotz said PERIOD But Im so excited to see all the pumpedup faces and reactions to the festival from the students and locals PERIOD I cant wait. austin Ellington KJHK live music coordinator hopes students will learn a little more about art and music and freshmen who are new to the area will have a safe and encouraging environment to be introduced to the culture on and around campus PERIOD

However not every student is convinced that the festival will be as great as advertised PERIOD Ashley Cervantes a sophomore from Wichita said the festival has a lot to live up to PERIOD

Ellington disagreed PERIOD He said the art will be  and the atmosphere is what sets the festival apart from others for students PERIOD

What I really hope is that kids will get their faces melted off by the awesome bands well have playing Ellington said PERIOD Students need a safe place to feel free to express themselves and to try out new things and I hope that this is what that will be. ellington and Krotz have been partners for the past two years because of the live music program on campus PERIOD Both feel confident SUA and KJHK have worked to bring what they think will be the best possible experience for students and locals PERIOD

Weve worked really hard to get a good variety of artists Krotz said PERIOD

More than anything Ellington hopes the festival will be an educational as well as fun experience PERIOD

We have the students we have the culture we have the opportunity Ellington said PERIOD Theres going to be so much diversity within the art and I hope that the people who come will learn more about different art forms and gain a better appreciation for whats out there PERIOD Even just learning about a different genre of music can affect how you look at a certain painting. there will be four music acts Various Acts LION Shy Boys and La Guerre as well as a student art gallery speed painter Lawrence film gallery and food PERIOD
