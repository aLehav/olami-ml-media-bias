4135,2007-01-19,"uCSB is one of the most politically active campuses in the state PERIOD However I see some of the activists we have on campus and cant help but suspect them of having ulterior motives PERIOD The specific organization is irrelevant because it can apply to any of them PERIOD

While there are some activists who truly care for the causes they have invested in others use these issues to further inflate their egos PERIOD These characters are the ones who are simply motivated by their desire to garner attention and publicity for themselves PERIOD These people not only want to be the hero who saves the day they also want everyone else to acknowledge it PERIOD

I despise these political mongers and attention whores not just for their hypocrisy but for the damage that they bring upon these important social issues PERIOD These phonies and their continued presence within an organization devalue the cause of other organizations PERIOD These people shift the focus away from an ideal so they can gain notoriety PERIOD Some are even willing to go so far as to martyr themselves to achieve their goals PERIOD But what happens when these people dont get their Tiananmen Square or their Kent State Will they continue pursuing their cause with the same passion or give up on it completely Is a cause any less relevant just because it doesnt lead to some climactic battle between good and evil

This phenomenon isnt limited to the local level PERIOD It can be extrapolated to a wide range of situations PERIOD Think about the Bush administrations continued insistence on military presence in Iraq or even Madonnas attempt to adopt a Malawian child PERIOD Are their motives genuine or have they solely taken up their causes because they desire praise

To be honest I myself am not currently involved with any activist groups because I dont believe that I have the true concern necessary to resolve some of our societys most pressing issues PERIOD Still I dont think that makes me a selfish uncaring villain PERIOD On the contrary it means that Im trying to remain genuine to myself and to others PERIOD

The closest Ive come to becoming an activist was when I signed up to be an International Student Volunteer PERIOD I did so because I wanted to tour Australia rather than help conserve the indigenous wildlife PERIOD I know I wasnt the only person since I talked to several other volunteers who felt the same way PERIOD I came back feeling the same way about wildlife conservation as I did prior to my stay in Australia PERIOD However thats not to say I didnt come away with a different outlook on life PERIOD What differentiates me from the phonies Im writing about is that I was completely aware of my stance and didnt pretend to feel otherwise PERIOD Many phonies have been active for so long that they are in denial of their insincerity PERIOD

I am not going to point out the specific people I suspect of being dishonest PERIOD I do hope however that the activists reading this column can take a moment to determine their exact motivations PERIOD

Take this insightful quote I got from Futurama If you do things right people wont be sure youve done anything at all. if you feel comfortable with not being recognized for your actions if you dont care that your cause isnt tomorrows headline and if you dont mind being on the losing side of a fight then perhaps theres still hope for you PERIOD
