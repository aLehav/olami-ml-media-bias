I am writing to you primarily regarding Guest Columnist Luke Perrins oped Madame President curb your nepotism but would also like to reference News Editor Mary Dare Martins current Top Story SBP appoints partner for Board of Elections chair. as Student Senate President I am bound to an Oath of Office and the Student Government Mission Statement which urge me to uphold and preserve the Student Body Constitution PERIOD To the present and future student leaders of the Student Senate this is a nod at the role the Student Senate President must play in protecting the integrity and interpretation of our rules PERIOD This session has called upon the Senate President to interpret rules of punitive powers lines of succession open meeting laws and now the Board of Elections PERIOD

With the resignation of Board of Elections Chair Emeritus Anna Yarbrough came another instance of having to dust off the trusty rules and read into what proper procedures must take place PERIOD Unfortunately our rules provide little in defining a timeline for such a vacancy yet are clear in the who and the how. i was grateful to Student Body President Gonzalez who unconditionally utilized me and our SG Advisers to ensure transparency and ethical decision making in her appointment especially with the abnormal technicality that this specific appointment must come by way of executive order PERIOD

With the exception of signing my own name next to President Gonzalez I have been afforded all opportunities to effectively counsel and direct this appointment process while upholding the full extent of our governing documents which is something that she has been transparent about PERIOD Furthermore if our counseling advisers and Senate procedures are not enough President Gonzalez has willingly given the Senate Committee on Appointments access to review her appointment PERIOD

So what is to be said about the ethics of this appointment Applicants Justin Lindemann and Jeremy Miller opted to no longer be considered for the position  appointing either of them knowing this would be pragmatically unethical PERIOD Applicant Adam Skrzecz had not and still has not divested his public support of a potential SBPSBVP candidacy which violates rule c of Chapter  Article  Section  of the Student Body Documents  appointing him would be statutorily unethical PERIOD

My advice to President Gonzalez was not by way of process of elimination but that of supporting the most viable applicant regardless of personal affiliation PERIOD This advice was matched by our staff advisers and the process has been fully documented for review by the Senate Committee on Appointments PERIOD

Misogyny in our Student Government goes back to our founding years PERIOD In  the thenentirelymale Student Government voted against the establishment of the Womens Student Government to More direct and authentic communication  not political undermining and rule bending  is called upon for Student Government to get to work PERIOD Senators continuing this disproportionate critiquing of women in leadership fail to serve all students PERIOD I conclude favorably with Guest Columnist Perrin  I hope that this matter of unusual business exemplifies that we absolutely cannot continue business as usual PERIOD

Sincerely

Mitchell Moravec

ninety-seventh Session Student Senate President

Mitchell Moravec is a fifthyear studying materials science and engineering and psychology and is the current Student Senate president PERIOD

 Editors note This column has been edited to include context about the history of women leadership in Student Government PERIOD

To preface I have no qualms with Shumates character or qualifications PERIOD Having sat beside him in a history course last year I can attest to him being intelligent and more than capable of serving in any capacity for the students at NC State PERIOD I do however have qualms with the nepotism involved in the appointment PERIOD
