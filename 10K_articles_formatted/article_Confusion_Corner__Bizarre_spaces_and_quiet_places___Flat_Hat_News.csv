8433,2023-11-05,"with graduation just around the corner for some students I think its time we finally confront some of The College of William and Marys most bizarre spaces PERIOD

Lets start with the Colonial Parkway PERIOD First of all the fact that the Colonial Parkway is still a functioning road that somehow does not have any safety precautions or lighted pathways terrifies me PERIOD One would think that after there was a literal Colonial Parkway serial killer years ago there would be more care put into making such roads feel like you arent entering the tunnel into a realm straight from Spirited Away. the bumpy texture unmarked divides and lack of any life other than the occasional redeyed deer make even the simplest of College Creek trips a thriller PERIOD

Another mysterious and unspoken place on campus is the entirety of Lake Matoaka PERIOD This includes both Matoaka amphitheaters the art gallery and remnants of obstacles used for Tribe Adventure Program classes PERIOD It has always been strange to me that out of a school of nearly  students I never see a fellow student walking through Matoaka at the same time as me PERIOD In addition the area itself is quiet and curious PERIOD Rumor has it that years ago there was a party house in the woods and the brick remnants of the building are still there however now it seems almost like a barren wasteland full of adventure and wonder PERIOD Despite all of its wonder Matoaka continues to be an enigma of the campus PERIOD

Finally I would like to bring up the fact that the old Student Health Center continues to be used by the school PERIOD I know because I was a part of the first class to use the space last semester PERIOD

The prospect of reusing an old building would be fine if not for the fact that this used to house thousands of ill students PERIOD Though our class was only using the main lobby as our classroom the rest of the Health Center is relatively the same  as in beds and desks and tools are still left in old offices PERIOD Our class often required us to stay until late hours and near the end of the semester the heating stopped working so we were stuck in a frozen tundra that was once the Health Center PERIOD

Similar to the halffinished One Tribe Place it seems to be a pattern of the College to continue to allow students into spaces that are half finished and questionably healthy PERIOD

Whether you are aware of them or not it should be known that all of these cursed places exist  on our campus and will continue to exist for a long time PERIOD So next time if you are wondering why Williamsburg is so dated take a look around and you will see that the past still fails to catch up to our present PERIOD
