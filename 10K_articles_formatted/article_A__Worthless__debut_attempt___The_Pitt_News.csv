Shortie

Worthless Smiles

Go Big Records



Have you listened to the radio lately Have you noticed how all the bands sound exactly alike Have you noticed how sometimes things get so bad that you confuse bands for one another Shortie may very well be part of a commission designed to proliferate this similarity PERIOD With their debut LP Worthless Smiles Shortie proves they were probably kings of the karaoke clubs singing everybody elses songs and sounding just like them PERIOD

A quick glance at Worthless Smiles cover art immediately hints at the bands lack of originality PERIOD The Talking HeadsGreen Daystyle censored faces have been done a million times PERIOD When you put the CD into your player the trend continues PERIOD Huge distorted fewchord guitar riffs greet you early and often PERIOD This might remind you slightly of Weezer minus the Rivers Cuomo charm until the we must scream our lyrics because were an angry rock band parts come in PERIOD That practice works if youre System of a Down PERIOD It works if youre Fear Factory PERIOD Shortie is neither PERIOD

If it werent for the brief pauses between the tracks on Worthless Smiles you might not be able to tell when one track ends and the next begins PERIOD Half of the songs begin with similarsounding drawnout single chords PERIOD The same guitar riff seems to run through the entire album varying by a few strings here and there PERIOD The vocals are horribly hook or harmonyfree and the lyrics are nothing special PERIOD Basically you get an album with  different takes on the same song which wasnt good to begin with PERIOD

For more proof of carboncopied mediocrity lets examine the song titles PERIOD We have The One Getting Over You Waiting and Kill The World among some of the gems PERIOD The biggest travesty comes in the form of David Bowie a song that bears no similarity to the rock legend except for having the phrase youre changing on me repeated throughout PERIOD And just for fun it still sounds exactly like the other nine tracks PERIOD

In a world of copycats Shortie is that really faded picture that comes after you make a copy of a copy of a copy PERIOD All this band needs is a new name PERIOD Staind Bizkit would do just fine PERIOD
