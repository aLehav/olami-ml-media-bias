Shea Patterson has played even better than the most optimistic Michigan fans could have expected PERIOD

Saturdays  win over SMU was the most recent example PERIOD And yes its only a threegame sample but the consistency and prolificity with which Patterson has played in those three games is something that hasnt been seen in Ann Arbor since  maybe Denard Robinson but probably Chad Henne PERIOD

Its certainly the best quarterback play Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh has had in his tenure PERIOD

Accuracy really PERIOD His reads feel really good hes making really good decisions Harbaugh said after the game PERIOD  Hes getting out of trouble and creating plays when sometimes there isnt one to be there PERIOD Just playing really  playing the position really well PERIOD And then making the throws when they present themselves PERIOD Hes hitting the short ones hes hitting the intermediate ones hes hitting the deep ones PERIOD Good quarterback play. strong quarterback play is something that Michigan has been searching for since Harbaugh has arrived in Ann Arbor PERIOD Jake Rudock showed flashes in  but the supporting cast around him wasnt ready and Rudock didnt have the physical talent Patterson has PERIOD

The last two seasons Wilton Speight Brandon Peters and John OKorn were surrounded by elite athletes but couldnt put it all together to lead the Wolverines to the promised land PERIOD

Patterson is that quarterback PERIOD The throws that were missed in past losses like the ones against Iowa in  or to Michigan State and Ohio State in   he can make those PERIOD Weve already seen it PERIOD

Patterson is now 46for65 for  passing yards and six touchdowns this season including three touchdowns each in the last two games PERIOD Michigan hadnt thrown three touchdowns in a game since Nov PERIOD   against Maryland PERIOD Last seasons team didnt have six passing touchdowns until the ninth game of the season PERIOD

Weve had Jake Rudock here and theres problems that are beyond the scope of a quarterback but in terms of how our offense efficiently played and how Shea looked Id say its as good as any quarterback Ive seen here said fifthyear senior defensive end Chase Winovich after the Wolverines win over Western Michigan two weeks ago PERIOD It was weird being on the sideline and them just scoring touchdowns PERIOD I remember junior safety Josh Metellus  he goes I just remember him sitting there looking hes like Man this is nice I think the feeling is mutual from my half. its ironic then that now that Michigan and Harbaugh finally have the quarterback who can make all the throws question marks have popped up around the rest of the roster PERIOD

It isnt the offensive line though they have struggled because that position has been a trouble area for at least the last two seasons PERIOD

What is different is that the defense that made Michigan a force to be reckoned with in the Harbaugh era has looked vulnerable at times PERIOD

The things that put the Wolverines in a hole against Notre Dame popped up again Saturday PERIOD There were penalties and missed assignments that against a better team might be a death sentence PERIOD Heck if it was last years offense that was on the field against the Mustangs the defensive lapses might have been a death sentence too PERIOD

But it wasnt because Patterson made play after play and throw after throw PERIOD Michigan for the second week in a row scored more points than it scored in any game last season PERIOD

SMUs first touchdown came when the Wolverines miscommunicated in coverage and wide receiver James Proche ran wide open up the sideline for a 50yard pitch and catch PERIOD On the next drive Patterson drove Michigan right back down the field  yards in five plays PERIOD He capped it off with a 35yard toss to sophomore wide receiver Donovan PeoplesJones PERIOD

It wasnt a hard throw as PeoplesJones was wide open but in the past year or so even the easy throws couldnt be taken for granted PERIOD

The thing about Shea is that he just has such a sense of confidence that doesnt come off as cocky but you just know and he knows  this is my opinion about it  that hes the man Winovich said last week PERIOD Hes the man for the job and he can get the job done PERIOD I think for him it was just another day at the office. i think I have written this part in every one of my columns but I do feel its appropriate to repeat when being critical this early in the season PERIOD It would be misguided to say that there are problems that will not be fixed or at least patched up enough to win any game moving forward  especially for a team with this talent PERIOD

But if the rest of the Wolverines dont solidify themselves this season might feel like a huge missed opportunity PERIOD Because Shea Patterson is the quarterback Michigan has wanted PERIOD It would be a shame to let that go to waste PERIOD
