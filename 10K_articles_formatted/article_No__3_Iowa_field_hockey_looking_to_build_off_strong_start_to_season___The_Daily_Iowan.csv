Since I was a freshman it has always been a goal to beat UNC fifthyear senior forward Maddy Murphy said PERIOD To do it at Grant Field in front of an amazing home crowd it was phenomenal. after an impressive opening weekend for the Hawkeyes Murphy was awarded several regional and national accolades PERIOD Murphy scored two goals and notched two assists against topranked teams PERIOD

On Monday Murphy was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week PERIOD On Wednesday the National Field Hockey Coaches Association also named Murphy the Division I National Offensive Player of the Week PERIOD

The NFHCA award was the first national weekly honor of her career but Murphy credits it to her team PERIOD

Those assists and goals were all teambased and I was lucky to be at the end of some of them Murphy said PERIOD Im very grateful for the honor but the team win was more important this weekend. now the Hawkeyes need to stay focused ahead of a long trip to the East Coast PERIOD

The message at practice has been that BU and UNH are two quality opponents with serious threats head coach Lisa Cellucci said PERIOD We have to get at it what we need to be better at primarily our transition to defense. the Hawkeyes will first take on New Hampshire in a neutral site at Bostons New Balance Field PERIOD The Wildcats split their opening weekend with a  win over Ohio and  loss to No PERIOD  Louisville PERIOD
