Continuing its yearslong trend Columbias tuition will increase for the  academic year as reported on the Front Page PERIOD

According to President and CEO KwangWu Kims Nov PERIOD  email sent to returning undergraduates tuition for fulltime students will increase by  percent990making the total  per year. a technology fee of  was also added for fulltime students and UPass prices are currently being determined PERIOD The rising tuition follows the  percent increase announced in the Spring  Semester for Academic Year  PERIOD

Though the email had some additional information about why the college decided to increase tuition some situations mandate more communication PERIOD In a time of financial uncertainty students need to hear their sacrifices are valued and worth it especially for those students who will not reap the benefits from most changes made with the new finances PERIOD The email did not include these necessary explanations neither did one from Board of Trustees Chairman Bill Wolf PERIOD

As reported on the Front Page Wolf said in a Nov PERIOD  statement that the reason for the increase is as the college looks to help students it needs capital for upcoming projects like digital learning Getz Theatre and classroom renovations and other new and improved learning experiences. we attempt to balance the pressures all families feel from the cost of higher education with the need to invest in Columbias greatest assetits students Wolf said in his statement after declining an interview PERIOD Students will have more tools experience and support to reach their goals and the college will have the opportunity to reinforce its unique presence in higher education. the students Wolf is referring to are incoming students not necessarily the ones who are already here PERIOD Future students are the ones who will benefit from major projects that will take years to complete or perfectbesides the technology updates PERIOD If the college had steady enrollment these projects would likely not mandate tuition changes PERIOD But unfortunately his statement does not acknowledge why students enrolled today should be content with paying for them PERIOD

Kims email an announcement that the college News Office said would be his only comment as of press time in addition to declining an interview briefly touches on ensuring that the Columbia experience remains unharmed in an era of dwindling resources PERIOD

The trustees and I along with the rest of the colleges senior administrative leadership remain committed to using student tuition dollars wisely and responsibly to improve the quality and fully realize the value of a Columbia education the Nov PERIOD  email stated PERIOD

This only scratches the surface of what the announcement should include PERIOD It didnt say why current students who are potentially questioning the current value of a Columbia experience should not go to a less expensive institutionor stay in school in general PERIOD Remaining in school may be in doubt for students especially those who are now without Monetary Award Program grants from the state because of the ongoing budget impasse in effect since  making state residents ability to afford college even more difficult PERIOD

Columbia had more than  MAP grant recipients in  whose grants were funded retroactively by the college PERIOD However the college could not afford to continue paying in  as reported April  by The Chronicle PERIOD

Tuition increases are often necessary to combat budget deficits and the college administration should not necessarily be condemned for making that decision as they know the effects it can have on enrollment PERIOD However students also need to properly hear why they should continue at Columbia when they are most affected by situations out of their controlsituations they are trusting their college to fix PERIOD
