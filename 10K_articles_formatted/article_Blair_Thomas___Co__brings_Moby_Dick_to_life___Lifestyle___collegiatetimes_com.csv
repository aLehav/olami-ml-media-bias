Blair Thomas  Co PERIOD Puppet Theater performs Moby Dick at the Center for the Arts on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

The sounds of theater talk antsy shuffling and ticket greeters filled the spacious air of the Moss Art Centers lobby on Friday Feb PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD A steadily flowing crowd of adults seniors students and children wafted through the sliding doors and down the ramp to the Anne and Ellen Fife Theatre located within the Moss Arts Centers Street and Davis Performance Hall PERIOD

The Blair Thomas  Co PERIOD Puppet Theater of Chicago Illinois was scheduled to perform In the Shadow of Moby Dick at  p.m PERIOD Rows of seats were filled as many faces from the crowd took to their seats encircling the large stage PERIOD

The production staff consisted of  members each of which contributed a unique role to the performance PERIOD Among the roles attributed in the directory were direction production design songwriter sound score consumes lighting projections projections assistant puppet builder and costume construction PERIOD

Of the  production staff members three of the  individuals appeared on stage during the performance Blair Thomas Michael Smith and Michael Zerang PERIOD The three starred alongside Michael Montenegro to form  the four featured actors of In the Shadow of Moby Dick. during the performance the four men utilized large sheets of paper lights multiple instruments and shadow puppets to portray an interpretive story of Herman Melvilles famous book Moby Dick. sounds of rainstorms and crashing waves echoed off the theatres walls filling the room with a chilling commotion PERIOD Likewise the puppeteers commanded the attention of the audience casting lights upon the same papers they used to create the sounds of a storm PERIOD

Among several shadow puppet depictions one in particular was the story of Pip a sailor aboard the Pequot who jumped overboard PERIOD The theater sat silent engaged and intrigued by the musicians and effects projected on the large curtainsized paper they had hung midshow acting as a backdrop for the puppets PERIOD

Among many in attendance of the show was David Tilson a senior from Lexington Virginia PERIOD He is currently a wildlife conservation major at Virginia Tech PERIOD Tilson shared why he had come out to the show PERIOD

This is my first time being in this building Tilson said PERIOD So this is actually the first show that Ive attended here but I love live theatre and cant wait to see the performance. tickets to the performance were  for the general public and  for Virginia Tech students with a valid student ID and children under  years old PERIOD Tickets were sold online through Virginia TechsCenter for the Arts website and at the Moss Art Centers box office Monday through Friday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD and on Saturday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD

Another student in attendance of the show was Justice Darby a sophomore at Virginia Tech originally from Chesapeake Virginia PERIOD Darby is a recent transfer student currently studying art and English PERIOD

Im actually here on a date Darby said PERIOD This isnt the first time Ive been to the Moss Art Center PERIOD Im really looking forward to seeing the performance and maybe dinner afterwards. throughout the duration of the show a large paper whale was hung in the middle of the stage still and floating PERIOD The round white figure was used as a backdrop for many of the general projections throughout the play PERIOD Videos of flowing water and starry galaxies were used to set the scenes on its surface PERIOD

However it was not until the end of the play that the purpose of the white moonlike whale was revealed PERIOD Otherwise presented as an abstract 3D backdrop to cast projections on it was used as a versatile prop PERIOD In the final scene one of the four men was stripped of his original costume and put on an illuminated angry head and claws clutching a harpoon PERIOD

As the lights dimmed and eerie music played through the theater the illuminated man with the harpoon stabbed the white figure floating amid the stage several times indicating that the paper prop was indeed intended to symbolize the whale PERIOD The dramatic endscene seized the attention of the audience many members gasping and sitting up in their seats PERIOD

The performance came to a close shortly after when the four men Thomas Smith Montenegro and Zerang approached center stage and took a bow PERIOD When the crowd broke out into applause the four men each extended an arm towards the crowd signaling the end to the puppet show and their appreciation for the audience PERIOD
