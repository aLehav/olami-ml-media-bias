The top  most innovative high school students in the state of Illinois will join together for a twoday event in spring  as part of a new Celebrating High School Innovators program to be launched by the University PERIOD

In an effort to focus less on grade point average and ACT scores Paul Ritter science teacher at Pontiac High School and Raymond Price iFoundry codirector teamed together to create a new program that would allow students to collaborate with professionals engage with University students professors and administrators and work with other students PERIOD

High school students are encouraged to submit an application to the program before Dec PERIOD  with a personal statement and a description of an innovative idea they want to implement in their community PERIOD

Price and I met several years ago and we were trying to think to find and work with kids who are doing amazing things and we decided to start this program to look for the top  teenagers who are inspiring and imaginative Ritter said PERIOD

The program will honor high school students across Illinois who have been able to meet current and emerging social needs through innovation in one of five areas arts media and literature business entrepreneurship food health and nutrition social entrepreneurship and science technology engineering and math PERIOD



Ritter said he chose the categories that are the most relatable to subjects students are taking in high school PERIOD

Price said that he believes the program is unique as no other programs attempt to identify a broad section of high school innovators PERIOD

There are people looking for leadership there are people looking for scholarship he said PERIOD

Price he believes the program will better highlight student capabilities since the program will base its selection on student accomplishments rather than test scores PERIOD

Price said there are four goals the program wants to achieve to recognize and celebrate high school innovators to influence the education system to allow for students to mingle with professionals from across the state and to focus on bringing about more discussion on innovation PERIOD

Price said the goals will be accomplished over a fiveyear period PERIOD

Someone can develop an iPhone app or allow people to understand their footprint Ritter said PERIOD I really dont know what we are going to get but I am excited for the possibility because kids have the ability to really surprise people with all they can do. ruge can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD",New University program looks for innovative high school students - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
